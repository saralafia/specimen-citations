Posterior sagittal diameter of the outlet is the distance between the apex of the sacrum and midpoint of the transverse diameter of the outlet (Fig. 1) . The posterior sagittal diameter represents displacement of the sacrum from the ischia, and it is markedly sexually dimorphic. Among individuals with a five segment sacrum, posterior sagittal diameter of the outlet is 14.7% longer in females than males, with mean values of 67.0 6 9 mm in females (N 5 83) and 58.4 6 7.8 mm in males (N 5 75; Tague, 2009:435, table 7 ; samples are of ""blacks"" and ""whites"" from the Hamann-Todd and Robert J. Terry Collections, and these collections are also used in this study). Among females, assimilation of a caudal vertebra with the sacrum cancels this sexual dimorphism, with these females having a mean value of 57.5 mm for the posterior sagittal diameter (Tague, 2011:432, table 7 ; 57.5 mm is the mean value of the means for ""blacks,"" 61.4 6 9.4 mm, N 5 29, and ""whites,"" 53.6 6 12.3 mm, N 5 28; samples are also from the Hamann-Todd and Robert J.

"SYSTEMATICS OF A RARE SPECIES OF POCKET GOPHER, PAPPOGEOMYS ALCORNI",,"SYSTEMATICS OF A RARE SPECIES OF POCKET GOPHER, PAPPOGEOMYS ALCORNI","Russell differentiated P. alcorni from its congener based on ''Outer (labial) three-fourths of posterior wall of M1 lacking enamel; bright buffy, instead of whitish, nasal patch; nasals broadly truncate instead of emargin- uals in the population, which is reflected in its designation as a rare species (SEDESOL 1994) . Interestingly, P. alcorni historically was found in sympatry with Cratogeomys tylorhinus, with the smaller P. alcorni occupying burrow systems above the much larger burrows of C. tylorhinus (Russell 1968) . Recent attempts by experienced field researchers have failed to locate and collect additional specimens of P. alcorni (Demastes et al. 2002) . Despite repeated efforts, this failure to locate individuals at published localities (and all nearby areas) raises concern for the present status of P. alcorni. Hall (1981) recognized that the only dental character used by Russell (1968) to distinguish P. alcorni from P. bulleri was quite variable in P. bulleri, and he questioned its use as a diagnostic character. Accordingly, Hall stated, ''If more specimens of P. alcorni are obtained, a study of them would be warranted to learn if the taxon differs specifically or only subspecifically from P. bulleri'' (Hall 1981:517) .
