This species is one of the few didelphid species that is polymorphic for presence/absence of secondary foramina ovales, which are formed by stout medial bullar laminae in some specimens , but not in others . The fugitive ventral coloration origi-nally reported by Thomas and subsequently noted by Pine and Handley , Patton et al. , and Pavan and Voss was also seen in our fresh material. The ventral fur of MUSM 2083 , for example, was bright pink in life , but it soon faded to a dull beige on the dried skin. Although sample sizes are small, it seems noteworthy that adult males and adult females in our Peruvian material have nonoverlapping measurements for many craniodental dimensions . Ethnobiology: The Matses do not distinguish this species from other short-tailed opossums and therefore have no particular beliefs about it. Matses Natural History: The Matses have no definite knowledge of this species. Remarks: Of the five specimens we collected, one was captured in a Matses house surrounded by secondary vegetation; another was captured by hand in old secondary vegetation near a Matses swidden; another was trapped on the ground in valley-bottom primary forest; a third was trapped on the ground in primary forest growing on white sand; and the last was taken in a pitfall in swampy primary forest. The specimen from San Pedro was trapped \"on a hilltop in a primary terra firme forest\" . Based on these observations, it would seem that Monodelphis emiliae is a habitat generalist, although Patton et al. 's trapping results suggest that it might not occur in seasonally flooded forests. One of our specimens was taken on the same date, along the same trap line, and in the same habitat as a specimen of M. peruviana . Consistent with the Matses' observation that short-tailed opossums are diurnal, MUSM 11065 was captured by hand at 07:30 hrs, and MUSM 13298 was found at 17:00 hrs in a trap that had previously been checked and found empty at dawn.

{"text": "The original measurement of the hindfoot of the type, 34 mm, is larger than any seen in the El Caimito series , but our remeasurement of the dried hindfoot of FMNH 110943 29.6 5 8.7 5 4.6 5 1.4 5 6.2 5 2.3 5 3.0 5 3.3 5 5.2 5 16.7 5 1.9 5 11.8 5 ' Measurements defined by Voss .

Tabulated external measurements include specimens from series B, but craniodental measurements are from series A only. suggests that the real difference may be less. Most of the cranial measurements by which the type exceeds the range of variation in El Caimito specimens are dimensions that exhibit strong positive allometry in muroid rodents and are consistent with the hypothesis that the type is an older animal than any of the Venezuelan examples . The type has slightly smaller molars than any of the five El Caimito specimens we measured, but the latter sample is too sparse to adequately represent the true range of dental variation in the Venezuelan population from which it was taken. In side-by-side visual comparisons of El Caimito exemplars with FMNH 110943, the greatly overgrown facial skeleton of the latter is obvious. Although the molars of FMNH 110943 are no more worn than those of some El Caimito specimens , we suspect that the type is in fact much older. The skin tag of FMNH 110943 notes that it was taken in a live trap by US Army medical researchers, and the oddly blunted incisor wear facets suggest that the animal was maintained in captivity for some time thereafter. Captive-raised murids generally grow to a considerably larger size than would be expected based on toothwear comparisons with noncaptives, and such growth would disproportionately affect positively allometric facial traits. In our judgement, craniodental morphometric differences between the type and the El Caimito material do not exceed those that could be expected to accompany age and individual variation within a single population. In all qualitative external and craniodental traits preserved in our material , the El Caimito specimens are indistinguishable from FMNH 110943. Because Hershkovitz's description was based only on the type, and because some characters now widely used in muroid systematics were not mentioned in his text, we provide a supplementary description based on the more extensive material now at hand. This species closely resembles O. palustris in external appearance. The ears are small, and the mystacial vibrissae are dense and recurved along the oral margins. The tail, distinctly bicolored at the base, has prominent epidermal scales, and the ventral caudal hairs are longer than those of the caudal dorsum ; the tail tip is provided with a short pencil of terminal hairs. The hindfoot is distinctly modified for semiaquatic locomotion, with a thin fringe of silvery hairs along the metatarsal margins ; the claw of the fifth pedal digit extends to the end of the first phalange of dIV, but the claw of dl does not extend quite to the end of pi of dll. The plantar surface of the metatarsus is hairless and smooth, but distal to the thenar pad the plantar epithelium is so densely tubercular that the tiny hypothenar and interdigital pads are hard to distinguish. Small webs of skin are present between digits II, III and IV, but these do not extend more than half the length of the first phalange on any digit. Each pedal claw appears to be naked because the sparse, short hairs rooted at the base do not form prominent ungual tufts. In dorsal view, the skull is distinctive by its short, blunt rostrum flanked by broad, deep zygomatic notches. The interorbital region is strongly convergent anteriorly with well-developed supraorbital beads that project as small shelves over the posterior part of the orbital fossae; posteriorly, these beads are continued on each side as a low temporal crest along the posterolateral surface of the braincase. The zygomatic arches are subparallel in younger specimens, but become increasingly rounded and flaring in older animals. The interparietal is deep relative to its width , with an average depth/width ratio of 0.41 in five measured specimens. In lateral view, the zygomatic plate is broad, its anterior edge vertical or slightly slanting forward; the anterodorsal margin is rounded, with no hint of an acute spinous process in any specimen. The incisive foramina are long and narrow, widest near their midlength and tapering more-or-less symmetrically anteriorly and posteriorly from this point; the foramina extend between the first molar alveoli of one young adult but not quite that far in the other specimens at hand. The palatal bridge has shallow lateral gutters but no raised median keel; the bridge itself extends far behind the molar rows and bears prominent posterolateral pits. The anterior limit of the mesopterygoid fossa is a rounded arch and the roof of the fossa is completely bony with no trace of sphenopalatine vacuities. The buccinator-masticatory and accessory oval foramina are confluent because the bony strut of the alisphenoid bone that separates these foramina in other murids is absent. The configuration of foramina and grooves associated with the carotid arterial circulation matches that described for Oryzomys palustris by Carleton and Musser and represents the most derived of three alternative carotid morphologies known to occur among Neotropical murids . The auditory bullae are small and uninflated, with abruptly constricted eustacian tubes and globular tympanic capsules. The tegmen tympani does not overlap a posterior suspensory process of the squamosal. The hamular process of the squamosal is very broad, reducing the subsquamosal fenestra to an inconspicuous notch that is almont completely occluded in some specimens. The upper incisors are strongly opisthodont with yellow-orange enamel bands, and the lower incisor root is contained in a prominent bony capsule below the base of the coronoid process on the lateral surface of the mandible. The upper molar rows are parallel, and the cheekteeth appear small in relation to surrounding bony structures. In occlusal design, the upper and lower molars conform to the pattern described for Oryzomys palustris by Carleton and Musser . Accessory roots are present on Ml/ml, but these are hard to see in younger specimens because they are positioned under the molar crowns. The characters of Oryzomys gorgasi match those of the O. palustris group as diagnosed by Goldman , and the detailed resemblances between gorgasi and palustris are so many that the close relationship of these two species seems certain. In effect, palustris and gorgasi represent geographic extremes of a morphologically distinctive species complex that constitutes the irreducible phylogenetic core of the genus Ozyzomys. Derived morphological character states that appear to support the monophyly of a palustris group vis-ä-vis other species currently referred to the genus Oryzomys include the presence of small webs of skin between pedal digits II, III and IV; reduction or loss of the hypothenar metatarsal pad and small size of the interdigital plantar tubercles of the hindfoot; presence of a natatory fringe of hairs along the metatarsal margins; pedal claws not concealed by tufts of long ungual hairs; ventral caudal hairs longer than hairs of caudal dorsum; deep zygomatic notches; beaded-convergent supraorbital margins ; long incisive foramina; pattern 3 carotid circulation; undivided Ml anterocone and undivided ml anteroconid; and accessory roots present on Ml/ml. In addition to O. palustris and O. gorgasi, other taxa that share this set of diagnostic traits and clearly belong to the same taxonomic complex include O. couesi and O. dimidiatus . The name Micronectomys Hershkovitz, originally proposed as a subgenus of Nectomys with dimidiatus as type species . From all of these taxa, O. gorgasi differs by a unique combination of traits, including an unusually stout, blunt rostrum ; posteriorly tapering incisive foramina ; the complete absence of sphenopalatine vacuities; and a broad hamular process of squamosal that reduces the subsquamosal fenestra to a small notch on each side of the skull. By contrast, other species of the palustris complex have longer and more slender rostrums, incisive foramina that are more widely open posteriorly, and narrower squamosal hamular processes delimiting larger subsquamosal fenestrae. In addition, O. palustris t O. dimidiatus, and some nominal forms currently synonymized with O. couesi have distinct sphenopalatine vacuities in the dorsal roof of the mesopterygoid fossa. In summary, while a comprehensive taxonomic revision of the Oryzomys palustris complex is clearly needed, especially in view of trenchant character variation that we observed among Central American taxa currently treated as synonyms of O. couesi, our revaluation of the status of O. gorgasi based on the new material reported herein is consistent with Hershkovitz's hypothesis that this is a distinct species belonging to the nominotypical subgenus of Oryzomys. The presence of Oryzomys gorgasi on the south coast of the Gulf of Venezuela extends the known distribution of this species about 700 km ENE of its Colombian type locality and securely establishes the palustris group of Oryzomys as an element of the continental South American fauna. According to Hershkovitz , the type of O. gorgasi was collected in a swamp on the east bank of the Rio Atrato at 7°54'N, 77°00'W. ", "meta": {"ref_id": "10.1515_mamm.2001.65.2.205.json"}}

{"text": "The opossum is said to occupy old leaf nests of the 'gray and fox-squirrels, where individuals often are killed by hunters who shoot through the nests. The mole occupies a type of habitat in the Bird Creek region that is quite different from that occupied by western members of the race. In western Oklahoma this animal is abundant in the stable sand dunes along the larger streams, but it is absent from the thin, baked soils of the adjacent uplands. In the Bird Creek region the mole is abundant in the heavy alluvium of the oak-elm association, where its preferred habitat is a moist forest floor with a good layer of humus and leaf-mold. Thlis habitat is similar to that occupied by the races pulcher and machrinoides in the Ozark region. Seven moles were trapped in the oak-elm association in Mohawk Park during the summer of 1935. Four specimens were taken in this association in the Garnett area during the first week of June, 1936. In the summer following the flood of 1935 the mole apparently was the only non-arboreal small mammal living in the flooded parts of the oak elm association. At various times during the summer fresh mole burrows were seen several hundred yards from the nearest unflooded land. These animals apparently retreated to high land when the lowland was inundated and quickly reoccupied it after the water subsided. Mole burrows occasionally have been found in upland situations where there is sufficient soil for their burrows. Numerous burrows were observed on the slopes of the Garnett ravines in the summers of 1935 and 1936, and occasional burrows were seen in cultivated fields adjoining the Garnett prairie. An adult, 'female mole was found at 7:30 p.m. on July 20, 1936, as it was traveling along a dusty road on the Garnett prairie. As there was cultivated land nearby it seems probable that the mole came from that rather than from the prairie, where burrowing would be almost impossible. Cryptotis parva. Little shrew. A male and female of this species with 5 suckling young were collected by A. P. Blair and P. F. Blair, Jr., on June 4, 1936, 2 miles northeast of Garnett. The animals were captured in a nest of shredded grass located beneath a limestone slab in the sumac grama association. The young were nearly grown, averaging 65 mm. in total length compared to 71 mm. in the adults. The shrews were kept in captivity for 24 hours during which time the young often were observed suckling the female. When the female was killed she was found to be pregnant. The 4 uterine swellings average 5.1 mm. in length. The little shrew apparently is rare in the region, as no other records were obtained. It is essentially a grassland animal, but possibly it may occur also in the forest as it does at times in other parts of its range. Blarina brevicauda carolinensis. Carolina shrew. The Carolina shrew was taken only in the oak-elm association. An adult male was trapped in this association in Mohawk Park on June 20, 1936, and an adult female was taken in Mohawk Park on July 30. An adult male was found dead by 0. W. Letson on November 14, 1935, in Mohawk Park. Three of these shrews were trapped in the oak-elm association on the Arkansas River flood-plain near Wekiwa, Tulsa County, west of the Bird Creek region. All were females, and all were taken on December 23, 1931. This content downloaded from 97.84.199.207 on Fri, 06 May 2022 16:25:43 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms Two of the animals were taken near large, rotting logs, and the third was caught in a trap set below the level of the ground in a hollow stump. Pipistrellus subflavus subflavus. Pipistrelle. Four male pipistrelles were collected by A. P. Blair in a natural tunnel in the Garnett ravines. The tunnel was about 4 feet in diameter and penetrated about 30 feet into a limestone bluff. One of the bats was taken on February 22, 1935, and was in hibernation at the time. The others were captured on July 21, 1936. Three bats that were seen flying together at dusk over the oak elm association at Twin Lakes on August 3, 1935, were identified tentatively as pipistrelles on the basis of their small size and peculiar manner of flight. Procyon lotor hirtus Nelson and Goldman. Raccoon. No specimen is available, so the raccoon of the region tentatively has been referred to the race hirtus, which should occur in northeastern Oklahoma according to Nelson and Goldman . The racoon is reported to be common along the streams of the Bird Creek system, where it lives in the larger trees of the oak-elm association. Racoon tracks frequently have been seen by 0. W. Letson in Mohawk Park. In 1933 a family of raccoons that he estimated to be made up of an adult and 4 or 5 young frequented a trail in the park where he often observed their tracks. Raccoon tracks often were observed on the muddy banks of Bird 28, 1938 . Several of these skunks were seen dead on the highway in the grama beardgrass association in the Garnett area. This apparently is a wide-ranging form like many other carnivores, and it probably occurs in most of the ecological associations of the region. Mephitis mephitis mesomelas. Striped skunk. This skunk ranges widely in the region, and individuals have been observed in all of the major associations except the bluejoint switchgrass. One was routed from its den beneath a limestone slab in the grama beardgrass association on the Garnett prairie in October, 1931. It traveled about 400 yards to the nearest ravine and took refuge in a hole at the base of the rim-rock. Another was found beneath a limestone slab in the sumac grama association. Skunk droppings often were seen in the ravine forest association in the Garnett area. Numerous skunks have been observed by 0. W. Letson in the oak-elm association in Mohawk Park, and several skunk dens were found by him. A striped skunk was seen by him at 8:30 in the morning of February 12, 1938. An adult male was found living almost in the center of Tulsa. It was discovered on August 31, 1935, in a length of pipe in a junk yard. Canis lupus nubilus. Wolf. This wolf is reported to be still common in the Osage Savanna, but it probably is extinct in the Bird Creek region. A farmer claimed to have killed a wolf on the Garnett prairie in the spring of 1935, but it probably was a coyote. The name wolf generally is applied to the coyote in the region. Canis latrans subspecies. Coyote. The coyote of the Bird Creek region probably is of the subspecies latrans, although no specimens are available. Coyotes often were observed in the grama-beardgrass association. In the summer of 1936, a coyote regularly followed at dusk the top of a ridge in this association on the Garnett prairie. In a drizzling rain on a day in November, 1932, a coyote was encountered near the crest of a ridge in the sumacgrama association in the Garnett area. The animal was sighted about 40 This content downloaded from 97.84.199.207 on Fri, 06 May 2022 16:25:43 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms yards away as I crossed a ridge, moving up-wind. On November 29, 1931, a coyote, pursued by hounds, was seen at Garnett mingling with a pack of mongrel dogs for a few moments before continuing its flight. The coyote was not recorded from any of the forest associations, but this wide-ranging form probably crosses most of the associations of the region at some time. Vulpes fulva. Red fox. There are no records of the red fox, but it possibly occurs in the region. Urocyon cinereoargenteus subspecies. Gray fox. The gray fox probably occurs in the region, although it has not been recorded. Lynx rufus subspecies. Bob-cat. The bob-cat still is found in the Osage Savanna , but it apparently is extinct in the Bird Creek region. Citellus tridecemlineatus texensis. Thirteen-lined spermophile. The spermophile of the Bird Creek region has been referred to the subspecies texensis by A. H. Howell . This spermophile inhabits the grasslands of the region. The species is not common on the Garnett prairie, but one individual was seen there in the grama beardgrass association on July 30, 1935, and a subadult female was taken there on July 4, 1936. One was seen there on July 5, 1936, in the sumac grama association. Spermophiles often were seen in the bluejointswitchgrass association in the vicinity of Tulsa. The largest population of spermophiles was found on a golf course in Mohawk Park, where 15 specimens were collected on August 3, 1935, and many other individuals were seen. Two half-grown albino females were captured in the same place on August 14, 1935, and a third albino animal was seen. A female spermophile that was captured in Mohawk Park on August 17, 1935, gave birth to 8 young on the following day. One of the females of the litter was measured at the age of 24 hours. The total length was 58 mm.; the tail length 10 mm.; and the length of the right hind foot 6 mm. Several toads and one gopher-frog were found in spermophile burrows in Mohawk Park on August 14, 1935. No spermophiles were found in the burrows from which these animals were taken. Sciurus carolinensis carolinensis. Gray-squirrel. The gray-squirrel and fox-squirrel occur together in all of the forest associations of the region. There is no restriction of the gray-squirrel to lowland forests and the fox-squirrel to upland forests, as occurs in most of the range of the 2 species in the southeastern United States. There seems to be a slight predominance of graysquirrels in the oak elm association and a slightly greater abundance of f oxsquirrels in the oak hickory and ravine forest associations. The occurrence of the 2 species together in almost equal numbers in the Bird Creek region may be due to the restricted extent of the forest associations. abundance, population pressure probably forces individuals of both species into all areas habitable by squirrels, so that no distinction is made between the upland and lowland forest. An adult, male gray-squirrel was shot in the oak elm association in the Garnett area on July 18, 1935. A subadult female was taken at the same station on July 27, 1935. An adult femnale was collected in the ravine forest association in the same region on July 27, 1935, and another was taken at the same station on September 5. Another adult female was taken in the oak hickory association in the same area on July 12, 1935. Gray-squirrels were very numerous in Mohawk Park in the summer of 1936, where they were observed in the oak elm, pin oak swamp, and lowland thicket associations. In June, 1937, these animals were found to be extremely scarce in the region, and few were observed in Mohawk Park, where they had been abundant the previous year. Sciurus niger rufiventer. Fox-squirrel. An adult, male fox-squirrel was collected in the ravine forest association in the Garnett area on July 27, 1935. Another adult male was taken in the oak elm association at the same station on the same date. Fox squirrels also were observed in the oak hickory association at this station. Fox-squirrels living in the ravine forest association were found to have the interesting habit, when pursued, of sometimes hiding beneath the limestone blocks littering the ravine slopes instead of taking refuge in the trees. Fox-squirrels were about as abundant as 'gray-squirrels in Mohawk Park in the summer of 1936, where they were observed in the oak elm, pin oak swamp, and lowland thicket associations. As many as 50 squirrels of the 2 species could be seen in an area of 2 or 3 acres in the early morning. This abundance may have been due in part to the fact that in the park squirrels are protected from hunting. In June, 1937, the fox-squirrels, like the graysquirrels, were so scarce that hardly one could be seen where dozens existed the previous year. The fact that the increase of 1936 and the decrease of 1937 occurred in the 2 species simultaneously seems worthy of note. It would appear from this that whatever may be the factors governing the abundance of squirrels in the region they affect both species simultaneously. Glaucomys volans saturatus. Flying-squirrel. An adult male and female were trapped in a large oak in the oak elm association in Mohawk Park on August 20, 1935. A pregnant female was trapped in the same tree on September 5, 1935. The 4 uterine swellings averaged 30.5 mm. in length. All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms September 5, 1935, and an adult male and female were taken at this the following day. An adult male was trapped in the same association Garnett area on June 8, 1936. An adult female was secured in the blu switchgrass association near Tulsa on August 17, 1935, and another was obtained on September 4. Pocket-gopher mounds were abundant in the sumac grama association on the Garnett prairie in 1933 and 1934. They were seldom seen in the summers of 1935 and 1936, which were periods of extreme drought. It seems probable that the droughts affected the pocket-gophers adversely by killing many plants thus reducing their food supply and by baking the soil so that it retarded the expansion of colonies. The pocket gophers in this region throw up mounds only when the soil is moist, so it seems probable that their burrows are enlarged only at such times. If young were produced during the drought years they probably would have difficulty in starting burrows if forced out of the maternal tunnels. No evidence of more than one individual living in a single system of burrows was found. Eleven pocket-gophers were collected on a golf course in Mohawk Park in August and early September, 1935. They seemed much less reduced in numbers on the golf course, which was watered during the drought seasons, than in other parts of the Bird Creek region. In the winter of 1937-38, 0. W. Letson found pocket-gophers invading the oak elm association in Mohawk Park. These animals are not known to have previously occurred in this association in the Bird Creek region. In the same winter, P. F. Blair, Jr. noted that pocket-gopher mounds were very abundant on the Garnett prairie in contrast to their scarcity there the preceeding 2 years. The rainy year, 1937, probably favored the increase of the pocket-gophers. Perognathus hispidus spilotus. Plains pocket-mouse. This species is most abundant in the sumac-grama association. Three specimens were taken in this association on the Garnett prairie in November, 1933. Eight were taken at the same station in the summer of 1935. In the summer of 1936, one of these pocket-mice was taken in the sumac grama association on the Twin Lakes prairie, and 20 of them were collected in the same association on the Garnett prairie. Six specimens were taken in the grama beardgrass association on the Garnett prairie in the summer of 1936. Two individuals were trapped in the plum thicket association on the Garnett prairie in September, 1936. Numerous pocket-mouse burrows were discovered and excavated on the Garnett prairie . All of the burrows were located at least partially beneath limestone slabs, and it is probable that the availability of these slabs is an important factor in the distribution of the pocket-mouse in the 3 associations in which it was found. This species was notably absent from ridges in the grama beardgrass association on which there were no limestone fragments. Such ridges generally were found to be dominated by buffalo grass , and the lack of heavier cover may have been responsible in part for the absence of the pocket-mice. In the sumac grama association pocket-mice were most often taken in situations where the ground cover was dense but limited to pockets between the abundant limestone fragments. They were not taken in the prairie drains or other parts of the association where the grasses formed a continuous ground cover. Reithrodontomys montanus griseus. Gray harvest-mouse. An adult male was trapped in the sumac grama association on the Garnett prairie on June 9, 1936, and a subadult male was taken on July 22. An adult male was collected in the grama beardgrass association on the Garnett prairie on July 3, 1936, and an immature male was taken the following day. An adult female was found on June 26, 1936, in a nest beneath a small limestone slab in the grama beardgrass association on the Garnett prairie. There were no burrows beneath the slab, except a shallow depression containing a nest of cotton about one and one-half inches in diameter. The cotton probably was collected about an inhabited shack about 50 feet from the nest. Peromyscus maniculatus ozarkiarum Black. Deer-mouse. A male deermouse was taken in the grama beardgrass association on the Garnett prairie on December 30, 1931, and another was collected at the same station on April 2, 1932. Four individualas were captured there in the summer of 1935, and 15 were secured in the summer of 1936. Fifteen deer-mice were taken in the sumac grama association in the Garnett area in the summer of 1935, and 17 were collected there during the summer of 1936. An adult male was taken in the plum thicket association there on September 2, 1936. In these associations deer-mouse burrows often were found beneath limestone slabs. The nests in these situations often were found to be made of the silky fruit of the oblong-leaved milkweed . Deer-mouse burrows also were found beneath clumps of prickly pear . Eleven deer-mice were trapped in the bluejoint switchgrass association near the southern edge of Mohawk Park in December, 1931. Most of the mice were trapped in an area that had been burned a short time before, and in this situation their burrows were easily located. Peromyscus leucopus noveboracensis. Wood-mouse. A female wood-mouse was taken in the ravine forest association in the Garnett area on December 30, 1931. It was trapped near a hole at the base of a large limestone block on a ravine slope. Another was trapped at the same station on April 2, 1932. One wood-mouse was taken in the ravine forest association in the Garnett area on June 20, 1935, and 4 were collected in the same association in the Twin Lakes ravines on July 2, 1935. Thirteen were collected in this association in the Garnett area, and 16 were taken in the Twin Lakes area during the summer of 1936. The wood-mouse was found to occur in all parts of the ravine forest association. Along the rim-rock it was associated with the brushmouse . Seven wood-mice were taken in the oak hickory association in the Garnett area in the summer of 1935. Eleven wood-mice were taken at the same station A male wood-mouse was captured beneath a log in the oak-elm association in the Twin Lakes area on March 4, 1932; a male and female were taken in this association at the mouth of Mingo Creek on March 19, 1932; and a male was collected in the same association near the mouth of Bird Creek on April 1, 1932. Fifteen wood-mice were taken in this association in Mohawk Park during the summer of 1935, and one was taken in it in the Garnett area. One of those taken in Mohawk Park was caught in a trap that was set about 20 feet from the ground in a large bur oak on August 31. Nine specimens were collected in this association in Mohawk Park during the summer of 1936. In the oak elm association the wood-mouse was found to live beneath fallen logs, in brush piles, or in trees. Individuals were most often found living beneath or within the dryer and less decayed logs. Six wood-mice were collected in the sumac-grama association on the Garnett prairie during the summer of 1935. Twenty-two specimens were obtained in the same association on the Garnett prairie in the summer of 1936. Many of the wood-mice taken in this association probably wandered into it from the oak-hickory and ravine forest associations. Some of them may have been living in the association, but no nests of these mice were found there. Fifteen wood-mice were taken in the lowland thicket association in Mohawk Park in August, 1936. Four mice were captured in the sedge marsh association, and 2 males and one female were taken in the buttonbush swamp association in the same region and during the same month. An adult male was trapped in the pin oak swamp association in Mohawk Park on August 19, 1936, and another adult male was caught in the weed association in the same region on August 25. The scarcity of wood-mice in these associations probably was due to the lack of homesites. The animals taken here may have wandered into the areas from the oak elm association. Peromyscus boylii attwateri. Brush-mouse. Four brush-mice were taken at the base of the rim-rock in the ravine forest association in the Twin Lakes area, in the summer of 1935. Seventeen of these mice were trapped at the same station in the summer of 1936. These mice were trapped at the base of the rim-rock and on the steeper ravine slopes. None were taken where there were not large rock outcrops with an abundance of fissures and crevices, and none were taken on the more gentle ravine slopes. The niche occupied by this species and that occupied by the wood-mouse somewhat overlap. The wood-mouse generally was found to live on the more gentle slopes, but it occasionally was taken on the steep slopes with the brush mouse and at the base of the rim-rock. On the rim-rock the brush-mouse is associated with the woodrat . A pair of brush-mice was observed in a woodrat nest near Okesa, Osage County, on August 1, 1936. It is surprising that the brush-mouse was not found in the Garnett ravines, as the conditions there apparently are suitable. Sigmodon hispidus texianus. Cotton-rat. An adult, male cotton-rat was taken in the bluejoint switchgrass association near the southern edge of Mohawk Park on January 17, 1932, where numerous runways were observed. On November 25, 1933, an adult female was trapped in the sumac grama association on the Garnett prairie. On December 29, an adult male was found at the same station beneath a limestone slab. The nuts of the black hickory and pecan and acorns of the blackjack oak were stored beneath the slab. There were 2 well-marked trails leading to entrances to the burrows beneath the stone. The ground about the entrances was littered with weed and grass stems that had been cut into short lengths. In the summer of 1934, cotton-rats were very abundant in the Bird Creek region. In July of that year these animals were found even on the barren ridges of the grama beardgrass association in the Garnett area. In these situations, numerous rats and their nests and runways were observed beneath clumps of prickly pear . At that time the cotton-rat cycle was at a peak, and undoubtedly the pressure exerted by over-population in the habitats normally occupied by the species forced many individuals into less favorable situations. Cotton-rats were so scarce in the summer of 1935 that only one individual was seen during 3 months in the field. This animal was found dead in the road 13 miles east of Tulsa in an area of sumac grama association. In the summer of 1936 cotton-rats again were abundant in the Bird Creek region, although they did not seem as numerous as in 1934 and were not found in the grama beardgrass association. Forty-two specimens were taken in the sumac grama association on the Garnett prairie during June and July. Twelve adult and 28 immature cotton-rats were taken in the sedge marsh association in Mohawk Park from August 11 to 14. Many of the immature animals were so small that they seemed hardly large enough to get around, and others were of various larger sizes. The large proportion of these young cotton-rats of various sizes indicates that the species was breeding in early August in the sedge marsh association. No very young individuals were among the 16 cotton-rats trapped from August 11 to 14 in the weed association in Mohawk Park, and the 3 subadults taken were almost fully grown. Only one subadult was included in the 17 cotton-rats taken from September 2 to 5 in the plum thicket association on the Garnett prairie. It is evident from this that the species was not breeding in August in the weed and plum thicket associations. Throughout the summer there was an abundance of 'green food available in the sedge marsh association in the form of sedge plants. In the associations in which the cotton-rats were not breeding the grasses and other low plants were dead and dry during late summer. It may be possible that green food is necessary for the normal functioning of the reproductive processes of the cotton-rat. The yearly fluctuations in numbers of cotton-rats from 1934 to 1936 correlate with the amount of spring rainfall. The spring of 1934 and that of 1936, preceding summers of cotton-rat abundance, were relatively dry, while that of 1935, preceding a summer of scarcity, was unusually wet. The wet spring possibly affected the cotton-rats adversely by flooding their homes and drowning any young that may have been produced. On February 27, 1932, 2 adult females were collected and other cotton-rats were seen beneath cane \"shocks\" in a field about 2 miles south of Owasso, The house-mouse was abundant in the same habitat. Neotoma floridana baileyi. Florida woodrat. One female and 3 adult, male woodrats were trapped in the ravine forest association in the Garnett ravines on April 16, 1932. Three specimens were taken at the same station in the summer of 1935, and 3 were collected there in the summer of 1936. A subadult male was collected in this association in the Twin Lakes ravines on June 30, 1936. In the ravine forest association woodrats were most often caught near the rim-rock. Their bulky nests of sticks and leaves could be seen in many places in the larger crevices in the rim-rock. The woodrats also were trapped on the ravine slopes near the larger limestone blocks. They occupied burrows beneath the blocks. Five wood-rats were taken in the oak-hickory association in the Garnett area during the summer of 1935. One of these was trapped near the entrance to a burrow under a large limestone slab. All of the woodrats were taken in situations in which there were more and larger limestone fragments than in most of the area. An adult, male woodrat was caught in the sumac-grama association on the Garnett prairie on November 12, 1932. It was trapped in the entrance to burrows beneath a large limestone slab, which was about 300 yards from the nearest part of the ravine forest association. Several fruits of the persimmon were found in and about the burrows. A woodrat was driven from a hole in a dead snag in the oak-elm association about 3 miles west of Catoosa on December 10, 1932. An adult female was shot in a brush pile in the same association near Catoosa by P. F. Blair, Jr. on February 15, 1936. In the summer of 1935, there were abundant signs of a woodrat living in a dead spotted oak standing in the oak elm association in the Garnett area. Microtus ochrogaster. Prairie vole. The only specimen of the prairie vole known from northeastern Oklahoma is an adult female that was taken a small area of bluejoint switchgrass association about one mile east of Garnett on April 2, 1932. The Bird Creek region must be very near the southern limit of the range of this species. Dice Dice concluded that the westward distribution of the species is limited by the drying up of the grassland at some time of the year. This would mean that in the Bird Creek region the species would be limited to the bluejoint switchgrass association, and that west of this region it would occur only in post-climax areas of tall grass. The destruction of much of the bluejoint switchgrass association in northeastern Oklahoma through cultivation and overgrazing has greatly reduced the extent of habitats suitable to this species. Pitymys nemoralis. Pine vole. Pine voles were found in the Bird Creek region only in the oak elm association. In the spring of 1929 or 1930, the number of pine voles increased almost to epidemic proportions. At that time almost every log or bit of fallen wood on the Verdigris River flood-plain opposite the mouth of Bird Creek sheltered one or more of the animals. An adult male was taken in the Twin Lakes area on February 13, 1932, and 2 adult females were taken in the same area on March 4, 1932. Two adult females were taken near the mouth of Mingo Creek on March 18 and 19, 1932. Another was collected near the mouth of Bird Creek on April 1, 1932. A female with 5 very small young was captured beneath a rotting log in the Twin Lakes area on February 15, 1933. The nest was made of grass, leaves, and shredded elm bark. When the female was disturbed she ran from the nest with the young clinging to her teats. This behavior was observed on many occasions when females with young were disturbed. A half-grown male was captured in a nest of grass and leaves beneath a rotting log in the Garnett area on Novembet 18, 1933. The nuts of the bitternut hickory and pecan and the acorns of the spotted oak were found stored in a chamber beneath the log. The pine vole was found to occupy a niche slightly different from that occupied by the wood-mouse . The woodmice were found under the more dry and less decomposed logs. Pine voles were found under rotten, crumbling logs with a high water content. In wet seasons pine voles were found at the Twin Lakes in nests beneath logs only a few feet from temporary ponds. There often was water less than a foot below the surface of the ground beneath the logs. In such situations the \"wells\" of crayfish often were found beneath the logs which covered the pine vole nests. Pine voles sometimes were found in winter living beneath corn \"shocks\" in flood-plain fields surrounded by the oak-elm association. The population of pine voles in the Bird Creek region was almost wiped out by the wet spring of 1935, when flood waters stood on the flood-plains of the region for several weeks. None of these animals were found during the summers of 1935 and 1936, except in Mohawk Park, where the floodplains were protected by a dike. An adult male and female were captured beneath a log in Mohawk Park, by A. P. Blair Zapus hudsonius campestris. Jumping-mouse. An adult, female jumpingmouse was taken in the lowland thicket association in Mohawk Park on August 17, 1936. Four days later an adult male was taken in the same association 170 yards from where the female was caught. The specimens extend the known rantge of the species southward from central Kansas into northeastern Oklahoma. The specimens are somewhat smaller and paler than typical campestris, but the differences are not sufficient to warrant subspecific recognition on the basis of no more material than now is available. Lepus californicus melanotis. Jackrabbit. Jackrabbits were observed many time in the grama beardgrass association on the Garnett prairie. Ore was shot there on November 24, 1932, and another was killed on November 26. Four were shot at the same station on October 1, 1933. A female that was shot on July 22, 1935, in this association on the Garnett prairie contained one large embryo. A jackrabbit that was pursued by dogs at the same station on June 21, 1935, killed itself by running into the bottom strand of a barbed-wire fence and cutting its throat. Jackrabbits were seen also in the sumac grama association in the Garnett area, but they were much less frequently encountered there than in the gramabeardgrass association. They were not seen in the bluejoint switchgrass association except where hay meadows had been mowed. An adult male and suckling female were shot on June 27, 1935, about one mile northeast of Garnett. The 2 animals were moving about together, and they hopped from an oat field across a road into a corn field. The stomach of each was filled with masticated oat grains. Sylvilagus floridanus alacer. Cottontail. Following a heavy snow, 6 cottontails were found beneath tree roots and in other protected spots in the oak-elm association near the mouth of Mingo Creek on December 27, 1932. An adult male was shot by P. F. Blair, Jr. in Seven cottontails were shot in the ravine forest association in the Garnett area on a day in the fall of 1933. Cottontails were observed in the Garnett ravines on numerous other occasions. They often would escape into retreats beneath the limestone blocks on the ravine slopes or into crevices in the rimrock. These animals often were observed in the oak hickory association in the Garnett area, where 5 specimens were taken in September, 1936. The cottontails were most frequently encountered in the parts of the association in which there was heavy cover. Cottontails frequently were observed in the sumac grama association in the Garnett area. A young male was shot there on June 27, 1935, and an adult male was collected there by P. F. Blair, Jr. on November 20, 1935 . Five cottontails were obtained in the same place during the first week of September, 1936. They were found to be rare in the grama-beardgrass association, but 3 specimens were taken in that association in the Garnett area on October 1. 1933. The cover is rather sparse for cottontails in this association. They never were seen on the more barren ridges dominated by buffalo grass . Cottontails frequently were seen in the plum thicket association on the Garnett prairie. They also were often seen in the bluejointswitchgrass association in various parts of the Bird Creek region. A cottontail was seen in the sedge marsh association in Mohawk Park on August 11, 1936. Swamp-rabbits were observed in the same situation. Cottontails were observed on numerous occasions in the buttonbush swamp association in Mohawk Park and in the Twin Lakes area. In the summer of 1936, they frequently were encountered in the weed and lowland thicket associations in Mohawk Park. Sylvilagus aquaticus aquaticus. Swamp-rabbit. Four swamp-rabbits were shot in the oak-elm association about 2 miles northwest of Catoosa on December 10, 1932. There was a 2 inch cover of snow on the ground, and one swamp-rabbit was seen and tracked in the snow. For the first 40 yards after being flushed the rabbit averaged 6 feet at a jump. Then the jumps lengthened to about 12 feet. When the animal crossed a weedy area the jumps shortened to 6 or 8 feet, but as soon as the rabbit left this and entered an area of bare snow the jumps lengthened to 10 and 12 feet. The tracks finally were lost among other rabbit tracks in an extensive thicket. On February 9, 1935, A. P. Blair and P. F. Blair, Jr. frightened a swamp-rabbit from a brush pile at the same station and shot it. An adult female was found dead in the oak-elm association in Mohawk Park on June 22, 1936. An autopsy showed no observable cause of death. A swamp-rabbit was shot in the buttonbush swamp association about miles northwest of Catoosa on November 20, 1932, and another was obtained there on November 25, 1932. Three specimens were collected in the same situation by A. P. Blair and P. F. Blair, Jr. in February, 1936. These animals often were observed in the sedge marsh association in Mohawk Park and on the Bird Creek flood-plain near Catoosa. On August . The summers of 1934, 1935, and 1936 were abnormally dry in the Bird Creek region, as in many parts of the central United States. The average rainfall in this region during the months of June, July, and August is 11.42 inches . There was a total of only 5.54 inches of rainfall during these months in 1934. In these months in 1935 there was a rainfall of 11.82 inches, but approximately 10 inches of this came in the first 20 days of June. In 1936 only 2.87 inches of rain fell during June, July, and August. During the first 8 months of that year the The dry summers of 1934 and 1935 had only moderately severe effects on the vegetation of the region. The most conspicuous results of these dry summers were the absence or scarcity of many late summer and autumn annuals and the failure of fall-fruiting grasses to set seed. The flood-plains of the region were extremely barren in the summer of 1935, as their inundation for several weeks in the spring killed much of the under-cover. The cumulative effects of the droughts of 1934 and 1935 may have intensified the effects of the drought of 1936 through the reduction of moisture in the soil. The great drought of 1936 had a conspicuous effect on the oak-elm association in some parts of the Bird Creek region. Numerous trees of several. species were killed, and the forest floor was opened up to many invading annuals. One of the most severely damaged sections in the Twin Lakes area was examined on June 28, 1937. A census was made of the trees in a strip 165 feet wide along the north shore of the south lake, comprising 1.4 acres . The American elm and hackberry , which were the principal dominants of the area, suffered most from the drought. The American elm was most severely affected, losing 29 of 61 trees on the plot, or 47 per cent of the elm trees. The hackberry was somewhat less severely damaged. Twenty-five of the 76 trees of this species were killed, and 3 suffered some top-killing. The trees completely killed comprise 34 per cent of the individuals of this species in the plot. In all, 15 of the 21 species of trees in the plot suffered some damage from the drought, either through top-killing or through complete loss of life. Thirty per cent of all of the trees in the plot were killed. The loss of so many of the trees allowed sunshine to penetrate to the forest floor. This resulted in the replacement of most of the shade tolerant herbs by annual weeds, of which the most conspicuous was the high-water weed . Among the undershrubs in the plot, many of the roughleaf dogwood , swamp holly , pricklyash , and prairie rose were killed to the ground. On the other hand, the coral berry , hawthorn , and blackhaw apparently did not suffer. The above described plot is an extreme example of the effects of the drought on the oak--elm association in the Bird Creek region. Most of the trees killed were within 80 feet of the lake shore, and they probably had shorter roots than those farther from the lake. Trees also were killed in other parts of the association, but not in such great numbers. The oak-hickory association did not suffer as severely as did normally moist situations in the oak-elm association, like that described above. However, trees were killed in many places in the oak-hickory association, and numerous other trees that were not killed suffered top-killing or the loss of large limbs. There also was in this association a heavy loss in the shrub layer, where the smooth and dwarf sumacs were stripped of their leaves and bark by grasshoppers. The grasshoppers destroyed these plants apparently because other food was scarce, due to the drought. The drought resulted in a general opening up of the forest in some parts of this association and in restricting the extent of the association where it was encroaching on adjoining grasslands. The effects of the drought on the grassland associations of the region were less conspicuous and apparently less severe than on the forest associations. The tall grasses achieved very little growth during 1936, and most of them failed to set seed. There may have been some decrease of tall grasses and increase in short grasses in the grama-beardgrass association similar to that found by Weaver and Albertson in Kansas and Nebraska, but no detailed study of the composition of the grassland vegetation was made. There were no changes sufficiently great to alter the general aspect of any of the grassland associations, and following the wet spring of 1937, these associations looked very much like they did before the drought years. This content downloaded from 97.84.199.207 on Fri, 06 May 2022 16:25:43 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms The most conspicuous effects of the great drought of 1936 in the Bird Creek region were the death of many trees of the dominant species in the oak-elm association, particularly in normally moist situations, and the death of numerous trees in the oak-hickory association, thereby reducing the density and extent of that association. Undoubtedly the changes in the vegetation caused by the drought resulted in changes in the local distribution and abundance of some of the mammals in the region, but information about any such changes that may have taken place is not available. In order to obtain a measure of the abundance of small mammals in the various associations of the region, most of the traps employed during the summer of 1936 were set in measured quadrats or in single lines of measured length. A quadrat 4 by 5 chains in dimensions was found to be a convenient unit and was employed in most situations where the extent of the association was sufficient to permit its use. Where an association was too small to allow the use of a quadrat of this size smaller quadrats were employed. The large quadrats contained 5 parallel lines of traps, the trap lines being one chain apart and 5 chains long. Each trap line consisted of 20 traps spaced about 16 feet apart. The close spacing of the traps made sure that most of the mammals would be trapped out of the area in a short period of time. In the smaller quadrats the trap lines generally were also placed one chain apart, and the spacing of the traps was the same as in tlhe large quadrats. The lines were laid out with a steel tape, and a compass was used in heavy cover. Small cloth banners, placed on stakes at intervals of one chain along the lines, facilitated the laying out of the quadrats. The single trap lines generally were 25 chains in length. A line of this length contained 100 traps spaced about 16 feet apart. A trap line about 12 chains long containinlg 50 traps, and another about 6 chains long containing 25 traps also were employed at various times. The measured trap lines are more easily set than the quadrats and can be placed in parts of ecological associations which are of such shapes that quadrats can not easily be laid out. Small, metal, live traps of several types were used except in 2 of the quadrats where snap traps were employed. The snap traps were of the \"Museum Special\" type. All of the traps were numbered serially. Both the live and snap traps apparently functioned equally well. The number of the trap in which each animal was taken was recorded together with the sex and approximate age class of the animal. All of the mammals caught were removed from the area. Each quadrat or single trap line ordinarily was maintained for 4 nights of trapping, although in a few cases the period of trapping was longer. In order that the calculations of relative abundance in the various associations may be comparable only the catch of the first 4 nights will be considered. This content downloaded from 97.84.199.207 on Fri, 06 May 2022 16:25:43 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms The animals taken in an area during the first 4 nights of trapping, how do not necessarily comprise the actual population of the area over whic traps have been set. It is probable that not all of the animals whose home ranges are crossed by the trap lines are captured in this period of time, although W. H. Burt has found that, in areas in southern Michigan in which he knew the population of wood mice, 90 to 95 per cent of the population could be taken in 4 nights of trapping. Some of the individuals taken on a quadrat have home ranges that extend beyond the limits of the outer traps, and therefore the area trapped out is larger than the area on which the traps are set. Another complicating factor is the possibility that some animals will wander into the area from unknown distances after the resident animals have been trapped. This method of trapping does, however, give an index of relative abundance that is free of the most serious of Dice's criticisms of the \"trap-night\" method of Grinnell . The use of standard time, areal, and trapping units makes quadrats set at approximately the same time of the year comparable. The even spacing of the traps reduces the probability of error due to the personal factor involving skill and experience in setting traps. The method is more reliable than that of Townsend in which the areal units were so small that in wandering from adjacent areas, for which no allowance was made, obviously contributed more to the size of the catch than the population within the measured area. The trapping records detailed below give, for the summer of 1936, a measure of the relative abundance of a few of the species of the region in the several associations in which they were found. Several other species of mammals were taken in the quadrats and trap lines, but so few individuals were obtained that little more can be said of these species than that they were rare in the Bird Creek region in the summer of 1936. Peromyscus maniculatus ozarkiarum. Deer-mice were taken in 2 quadrats in the grama-beardgrass association and in 4 quadrats in the sumac grama association. The number of mice taken per quadrat in one of these associations is comparable with the catch per quadrat in the other. This is true because the quadrats were of the same size ; they were set at approximately the same time of the year ; and each quadrat was located in the midst of a large, uniform area, making the chances of inwandering the same in each quadrat. Ten deer-mice were taken from June 24 to 27 in one quadrat in the grama-beardgrass association, and 5 were caught in the other from July 3 to 6. The 4 quadrats run in the sumac-grama association in June and July took 6, 4, 3, and 3 deer-mice respectively. This suggests that deer-mice were more abundant in the grama-beardgrass than in the sumac-grama association in the summer of 1936. Perognatbus hispidus maximus. Pocket-mice were taken in all of the quadrats in which the deer-mice were caught, and the catch of pocket-mice in the 2 associations can also be directly compared. Three pocket-mice were captured in one of the 2 quadrats in the grama-beardgrass association, and one indiivdual was taken in the other. The 4 quadrats in the sumac grama association took 7, 6, 5, and 2 pocket-mice respectively. This seems t indicate that these mice were more abundant in the sumac-grama than in grama-beardgrass association. Peromyscus leucopus noveboracensis. The numbers of wood-mice tak per quadrat in the various associations are not comparable, because qua and single lines of various sizes were necessitated by the variations in the and shape of the areas covered by many of the associations. However, abundance of wood-mice in the various associations may be compared if average catch of these animals per acre in each can be calculated. The reliability of these calculations depends on the accuracy with which the area trapped out can be computed. The home ranges of some of the mice taken will lie partially outside of the measured area, and an allowance for this must be made in the calculation of the area trapped out. W. H. Burt has found that the average width of the home range of the wood-mouse in southern Michigan is about 250 feet. If we assume that the home range of the wood-mouse is the same in the Bird Creek region as in southern Michigan, 125 feet may be added to each side of each quadrat or single line, except on the sides bounded by unfavorable habitats. The chief difficulty in determining the average catch per acre lies in the impossibility of distinguishing between animals whose home ranges are at least partially within the measured area and those that wander in after the residents have been removed. The computed numbers per acre are not strictly comparable because of this inability to distinguish between resident and invading individuals and because there are less chances of invasion in partially or completely isolated quadrats than in quadrats set in the midst of extensive associations. However, the error from this source is believed not to be great enough to obscure the larger differences in numbers of wood-mice in the various associations, and the computed number per acre probably is a rough approximation of the population per acre. The greatest concentration of wood-mice was in the ravine forest association, where the computed catch per acre was 2.01 animals . The TABLE 2 Computed catch of wood-mice in the Bird Creek region.

Wood-mice occasionally were found in the sumac-grama association on the Garnett prairie, as stated in the annotated list. In the summer of 1936, one individual was taken in a quadrat in this association on June 26, and 2 others were taken on July 21 and 23, respectively. These animals probably were wanderers from the adjoining oak-hickory and ravine forest associations. A quadrat in the sumac-grama association had one of its long sides parallel to the edge of the oak-hickory association which was about 100 yards away. Nineteen wood-mice were taken in this quadrat from June 6 to 10. All of the mice appeared to be young of the year, although some had attained adult pelage. Young wood-mice were found by Burt to wander more than old animals and to push out from their preferred habitats into unfavorable situations during their search for homesites. The wood-mice taken in this quadrat probably were wanderers from the nearby oak-hickory association. Wood mice were taken rarely later in the summer in the quadrats in the sumac-grama association, probably because young mice were not being produced then. Sigmodon hispidus texianus. The problem of comparing the numbers of cotton-rats taken in the various associations is more difficult than that of comparing the numbers of wood-mice. The average size of the home range of the cotton-rat is not known, so in the computation of the average catch per acre an arbitrary addition of one chain has been made beyond the outermost traps on each side of the quadrat on which there was a habitat occupied by cotton-rats. The allowance of one chain is based on a general knowledge of the habits of the species, which indicates a smaller home range than that of the wood-mouse. The computed number of cotton-rats per acre is much greater for the sedge marsh association than for the other associations in which they were taken . All of the cotton-rats taken in this association apparently were residents, as the area trapped was isolated. It was surrounded by the pin oak swamp association, in which cotton-rats were not taken. The computed catch per acre is greater in the plum thicket association , weed association , and sumac-grama association than in the oak-elm, lowland thicket, and buttonbush swamp associations. In these latter associations so few cotton-rats were taken that it can only be said that the species was scarce in these habitats. The relative abundance or scarcity of cotton-rats in the various associations is correlated in a general way with the amount of ground cover available. The heaviest ground cover was present in the sedge marsh association, where the computed catch per acre was greatest. Less cover was available in the weed, plum thicket, and sumac-grama associations, where the computed catch per acre was much less than in the sedge marsh association. Very little ground cover was present in the oak-elm and lowland thicket associations because of the shading of the forest floor by the shrub layer, and cotton-rats were scarce in these associations. They also were scarce in the buttonbush swamp association, where there was little ground cover, because the buttonbushes shaded the ground. It is not known whether the ground cover is more important as protection to the cotton-rats or as a source of food, but it probably is important as both. The population studies presented above, while obviously subject to a considerable degree of error, give a more reliable measure of mammalian abundance than any other method in use at present, except the marking and retrapping of live animals on measured plots, a technique that is not practicable in reconnaissance work. The data obtained through the above studies give a usable measure of the abundance of a species in the various ecological associations in which it occurs. The Bird Creek region is intermediate in position between the eastern deciduous forest and the grasslands of the Great Plains, and it is part of an area about 100 miles wide which is neither predominantly forest nor grassland. This strip in northern Oklahoma liest west of the Ozark biotic district which is a part of the eastern deciduous forest. West of this strip -lies the Mixed-grass Plains district of the Great Plains grasslands. The Bird Creek region is located approximately midway between the western border of the Ozark district and the eastern border of the Mixed-grass Plains district. Ecological associations of both the eastern deciduous forest and the Great 'Plains grasslands occur in the Bird Creek region. The oak-elm, ravine forest, and oak-hickory associations are related to certain eastern deciduous forest associations, as represented in the Ozark district . 'The Great Plains grasslands are represented in the Bird Creek region by the grama-beardgrass and plum thicket associations, which resemble typical associations of the Mixed-grass Plains district. The bluejoint-switchgrass association is closely related to the typical association of the tall-grass prairies, as represented in Illinois and Indiana . Limestone soil that is thinner than that occupied by the oakhickory association becomes very dry in summer and is occupied by the gramabeardgrass association, which is related to the semi-arid grasslands of the Great Plains. Shale soil in the Bird Creek region is occupied by the bluejointswitchgrass association. Since the oak-hickory association constitutes the climax in the Bird Creek region the oak-elm and ravine forest associations represent post-climaxes , and the bluejoint-switchgrass and grama-beardgrass are sub-climax associations. As a result of the edaphic control of the occurrence of the various ecological associations in the Bird Creek region, there is here an interdigitation of the associations representing the eastern deciduous forest with those of the tall-grass prairies and with those of the Great Plains grasslands. These associations maintain their individual characteristics in the Bird Creek region, therefore ecological associations of the eastern deciduous forest, of the Great Plains grasslands, and of the tall-grass prairies here exist side by side. Periods of drought, like that extending through the summer of 1936, and probably also prairie fires aid in maintaining the above described relationships of the ecological associations in the Bird Creek region. The droughts prevent the forest from occupying the grasslands by killing numerous trees in the forest associations, thereby reducing the extent and density of these associations. This content downloaded from 97.84.199.207 on Fri, 06 May 2022 16:25:43 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms Since the Bird Creek region is intermediate in position and in cli between the eastern deciduous forest and the Great Plains grasslan since ecological associations of both maintain their individual charac here, it is not strictly referable to either. However, it is theoretically to the eastern deciduous forest, since the oak-hickory association, here encroaching slightly on the grassland associations, is considere regional climax. It seems doubtful, however, that under the present conditions the oak-hickory association would ever replace the grassl ciations. Severe droughts, to which the region occasionally is subjected the spread of forest associations by killing the trees, and the constan wind velocity probably reduces, through evaporation, the amount of available for plant growth to much less than the average annual rainf seem to indicate. Four of these species, the opossum , gray-squirrel , fox-squirrel , and flying-squirrel , are semi-arboreal. The pipistrelle is a cave-inhabiting form, which probably is largely limited by the absence o caves from the eastern Great Plains. Two non-arboreal species, the Carolin shrew and pine vole , are confined almost entirely to the mesic floor of the oak-elm association. The little shrew occurs in the sumac-grama association in the Bird Creek region, and it commonly occurs also in grassy fields throughout its range Therefore, it seems probable that some factor other than the absence of forest associations limits its western distribution. The mole extends out into the Great Plains along the streams farther than does the lowland forest. Soil that can be worked easily is an essential factor in the distribution of this species, and east-west stream valleys are highways by which the species extends out into the Great Plains. In western Oklahoma this species is abundant in the sand dunes adjoining the larger streams, where the characteristic plants are sand-inhabiting species with western affinities. The wood-mouse in the Bird Creek region occurs occasionally in the sumac-grama association, but it otherwise is confined to the forest associations. The species extends westward with the oak-elm association along the flood-plains of the streams. However, it extends beyond the western limits of this association and inhabits brushy situations in the grasslands of western Oklahoma. West of the Great Plains the species occurs in brush and forest associations. The Florida woodrat in the southeastern states is more arboreai than in the western part of its range. In the Bird Creek region the species occasionally nests in trees, although it most frequently is associated with rock outcrops. The woodrat extends westward along the stream valleys, and in Oklahoma it apparently does not extend beyond the western limits of eastern deciduous forest associations. In western Kansas the species is in part saxicolous and is said also to live on the open, grassy plains. The Florida cottontail is abundant in the Bird Creek region in the several forest associations and in the sumac-grama association, which is intermediate between the deciduous forest associations and those of the Great Plains grasslands. It also occurs occasionally in the Great Plains grassland associations. The species is distributed westward along the stream valleys and extends beyond the western limits of the eastern deciduous forest associations. In western Oklahoma it is abundant in the sand dunes adjoining the larger streams. The 3 Gulf coastal plain species in the Bird Creek region are a pocketgopher , a cotton-rat , and the swamp rabbit . The pocket-gopher occurs in the Bird Creek region in grassland associations and in the oak-elm association. Soil sufficiently deep for burrowing is an important factor in the distribution of this species. Its westward distribution follows along the stream valleys, for in western Oklahoma it is largely confined to them. In northeastern Oklahoma the species approaches the northern limits of its known range.

It approaches the northern limits of its known range in northeastern Oklahoma. The swamp-rabbit enters the Bird Creek region through the valley of the Arkansas River. In the Bird Creek region this species is confined to forest associations of the flood-plain, and so far as known it occurs in no other associations in northeastern Oklahoma. The species extends westward along the streams at least to the western edge of the Osage Savanna biotic district. It reaches the northern limit of its range in southeastern Kansas. None of the Gulf coastal plain species found in the Bird Creek region are limited in their northern distribution by any observable physical barrier, and the northern limits of none of them coincide with any marked change in the vegetation or physical environment. The only species in the Bird Creek region that hlas the tall-grass prairies as its area of greatest abundance is the prairie vole . It occurs in the bluejoint-switchgrass association in the Bird Creek region, and apparently approaches the southwestern limits of its range there. It probably does not extend westward beyond the limits of the tall-grass prairie type of association, and its southern limit possibly is determined by the maximum summer temperature, as stated in the annotated list. The 4 species in the Bird Creek region having the Great Plains grasslands as their area of greatest abundance are the prairie spotted skunk , thirteen-lined spermophile , plains pocket-mouse , and gray harvest-mouse . All of these species range widely northward and southward in the Great Plains. The pocket-mouse and harvest-mouse are confined in the Bird Creek region to the grama-beardgrass, plum thicket, and sumacgrama associations and apparently reach their eastern limits at the eastern limits of the ecological associations representative of the Mixed-grass Plains biotic district. Thle prairie spotted skunk, which occurs in the Bird Creek region in both grassland and forest associations, extends northeastward for some distance into the tall-grass prairies, but so far as known it does not cross the Mississippi River. The thirteen-lined spermophile, which ranges over most of the Great Plains grasslands and which in the Bird Creek region occurs in both mixed-grass and tall-grass associations, extends eastward in the tallgrass prairies to northern Ohio. Three species that are widely distributed in western North America occur in the Bird Creek region, into which they range from the Great Plains grasslands. These species are the coyote , deer-mouse , and black-tailed jackrabbit . The coyote is known to occur in the grama-beardgrass and sumac-grama associations in the Bird Creek region. It ranges eastward in the tall-grass prairies, but so far as known it does not occur in forest associations in eastern Oklahoma. The deer-mouse is widely distributed in the Great Plains grasslands. In the Bird Creek region it occurs in both the mixed-grass and tall-grass type of associations. The species extends eastward in the tall-grass prairies and also inhabits the northern part of the eastern deciduous forest and the forests of the Appalachian Mountains. It does not extend eastward from the Great Plains grasslands into the ecological associations of the central and southern parts of the eastern deciduous forest. The jackrabbit reaches its eastern limit at approximately the eastern limits of the mixed-grass type of associations. It does not occur in the ecological associations of the tall-grass prairies nor in those of the eastern deciduous forest. However, the destruction of these associations in large areas and their replacement by cultivated fields or barren pasture land have permitted the jackrabbit to extend its range some distance eastward in historic time. One species of which the area of -greatest abundance is boreal North America occurs in the Bird Creek region. This is the jumping-mouse , which is at approximately the southern limit of its known range. The species extends southward along the Atlantic coast to Raleigh, North Carolina, but there are no known records of the jumping-mouse from the states intervening between North Carolina and Oklahoma. The jumpingmouse occupies brushy situations along streams in the northern Great Plains, and the species probably extends along north-south stream valleys into the Bird Creek region, where it is recorded from the lowland thicket association. A possible course would be by way of the Missouri, Osage, and Grand river systems. One species that has as its area of greatest abundance the desert mountain ranges of southwestern North America occurs in the Bird Creek region. This is the brush-mouse , which occupies brushy and rocky habitats in many parts of Mexico and the southwestern United States. Wooded and rock-bordered stream valleys that cross the Great Plains grasslands probably are highways for the eastward distribution of this species. The brush-mouse, which is confined to the ravine forest association in the Bird Creek region, extends eastward into the Ozark biotic district of southwestern Missouri and northwestern Arkansas, where it occupies an association similar to the one to which it is confined in the Bird Creek region. The red bat and the big brow are inhabitants of forest associations. For this reas much of the Great Plains, although they occur both east and west of the plains. The striped skunk in the Bird Creek region ranges over most of the associations, as it does in most other regions in which it occurs. The species is not restricted to any particular type of ecological associations, possibly because of its specialized organs of defense, which make it more or less independent of the physical and vegetational features of the environment for protection. The raccoon , mink , and muskrat are inhabitants of the aquatic and littoral associations and range along streams into many biotic areas of North This content downloaded from 97.84.199.207 on Fri, 06 May 2022 16:25:43 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms America. The most important factor in the distribution of these form ently is the presence of water, and if water is present they are tolerant of many kinds of environments. All range across the Great Plains along the streams and are widely distributed along streams both east and west of the plains. The several species of mammals in the Bird Creek region have various areas of greatest abundance, but the most important are the eastern deciduous forest, the Gulf coastal plain, and the Great Plains grasslands. Several species of wide distribution in western North America occur in the region and form with the Great Plains grassland mammals an important element of grassland species. Others range over most of North America and occur in many biotic areas. The northern limits of Gulf coastal plain species that occur in the Bird Creek region and the southern limits of boreal and tall-grass prairie species that are present there are not correlated with any noticeable change in the physical environment. A species tends to occupy, in the Bird Creek region, ecological associations similar to those it occupies in its area of greatest abundance. Seven of the 12 eastern deciduous forest species in the Bird Creek region are confined to forest associations, and one of the Gulf coastal plain species also is confined to forest associations. Four Great Plains grassland species and 3 species of wide distribution in western North America are confined in the Bird Creek region to Great Plains grassland associations. The one tall-grass prairie species in the Bird Creek region is recorded in the region only from a tall-grass prairie association. The southwestern species in the Bird Creek region is confined to the ravine forest association, and the species of which the area of greatest abundance is boreal North America is only recorded from the lowland thicket association. While there is a tendency, as shown above, for most species in the ecotone between the eastern deciduous forest and the Great Plains grasslands to be restricted to associations similar to those they occupy in their respective areas of greatest abundanlce, some, in this transition area, spread out into other types of associations. Four of the eastern deciduous forest species in the Bird Creek region, though most abundant in forest associations, occur here occasionally in grassland associations, and one species has been recorded in the region only from a grassland association. Three of the species in the Bird Creek region that either are widely distributed in western North America or have the Great Plains grasslands as their area of greatest abundance occur here in the tallgrass prairie type of association, and another species occurs also in forest associations. One of the Gulf coastal plain species in the Bird Creek region occurs here in grassland associations, although it is most abundant in the forest associations, and another occurs in the region principally in grassland associations, although it is present also in forest associations.

Four of the eastern deciduous forest species and one of the Gulf coastal plain species of the Bird Creek region extend westward into the Great Plains grasslands. Two Great Plains grassland species and 2 species of wide distribution in western North America that occur in the Bird Creek region extend northeastward into the tall-grass prairies. There is a tendency for most of the species to be changed into other races as they extend into areas where they occupy habitats different from those they inhabit in their respective areas of greatest abundance. The 4 eastern deciduous forest species that extend westward into the Great Plains grasslands are represented there by distinct races. The mole of western Oklahoma is paler than the races that occur in the eastern deciduous forest and constitutes the race Scalopus aquaticus intermedius. The mole of the Bird Creek region is intermediate in color between the moles of the eastern deciduous forest and the western race, although it is referable to the latter. The wood-mouse of the Bird Creek region is of the race Peromyscus leucopus noveboracensis, which occupies much of the northern half of the eastern deciduous forest. In the Mixed-grass Plains district this race is replaced by the paler colored race texanus. The Florida woodrat of the Bird Creek region is of the race Neotoma floridana baileyi, which is characteristic of the broad ecotone between the eastern deciduous forest and the Great Plains grasslands. This race mostly is associated with rock outcrops along the edges of the stream valleys, although it also occurs away from rocks in the flood-plain forest. To the east it intergrades with the races rubida and illinoensis, which occupy the lowlands of the lower and middle Mississippi Valley. In western Kansas baileyi supposedly intergrades with the pale-colored race campestris, which inhabits there the Great Plains grasslands. In western Oklahoma the Great Plains grasslands are occupied by Neotoma micropus, which belongs to the same species group. The cottontail of the Bird Creek region is of the race Sylvilagus floridanus alacer, which centers in the Ozark district. It is replaced in western Oklahoma by the paler racer llanensis . The one Gulf coastal plain species in the Bird Creek region that extends westward beyond the limit of forest associations is the pocket-gopher . It is represented in the Bird Creek region by the race breviceps, which occurs in alluvial soil in Louisiana and eastern Texas and Oklahoma. In central Oklahoma and Texas it intergrades with the paler colored race llanensis, which inhabits stream valleys in western Oklahoma and northwestern Texas. One Great Plains grassland species and 2 species of wide distribution in western North America that enter the Bird Creek region from the Great Plains grasslands are represented in the tall-grass prairies by distinct races. The thirteen-lined spermophile of the Bird Creek region is of the race Citellus tridecemlineatus texensis, which ranges over the Mixed-grass Plains district. This content downloaded from 97.84.199.207 on Fri, 06 May 2022 16:25:43 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms Northeastward it intergrades with the race tridecemlineatus, which oc the tall-grass prairies. The coyote of the Great Plains grasslands in Ok is of the race Canis latrans nebrascensis according to Jackson and W . This is replaced in the tall-grass prairies by the race latrans. The deer-mouse of the Bird Creek region is closely related to the race Peromyscus maniculatus ozarkiarum, of the southern Ozarks, and to bairdii of the tall-grass prairies, but it is best referred to the former race. It intergrades gradually westward with a paler colored form that resembles the race nebrascensis of western Kansas and Nebraska. Two species of the Bird Creek region that are widely distributed in North America are represented by distinct races in the tall-grass prairies and in the Great Plains grasslands. One of these species, the striped skunk , also is represented in the nearby eastern deciduous forest by a distinct race. The striped skunk of the Bird Creek region is referable to this race, mesomelas, which ranges through Louisiana and Arkansas and westward through the eastern half of Oklahoma and Texas. It apparently intergrades in western Oklahoma with the race varians of the Great Plains grasslands. Northeastward, it intergrades with the race avia of the tall-grass prairies . The other widely distributed species is the muskrat , which is represented in the Bird Creek region by the race cinnamomina. This race is widely distributed in the Great Plains and intergrades with the race zibethica at the approximate border between the Great Plains grasslands and the tall-grass prairies . From the discussion above, it is evident that there is a tendency for a species to become modified as it extends beyond the types of habitats that it occupies in its area of 'greatest abundance.

{"text": "They eat all kinds of dicot fruits, their favorites are këku [ Cebids include night monkeys ; capuchins and squirrel monkeys ; and a distinctive clade of small, clawed species that includes Goeldi's monkey, marmosets, and tamarins . Eight cebid species in six genera are definitely known to occur in the Yavarí-Ucayali interfluve. Subfamily Aotinae Elliot, 1913 Night monkeys comprise eight currently recognized species in a single genus that ranges from Panama to northern Argentina . Seldom seen by day, and hard to see at night due to their weak eyeshine, night monkeys are more frequently detected by their distinctive vocalizations. Unfortunately, the taxonomy of night monkeys has never been comprehensively revised, and many questions of identification remain. In the absence of reliable criteria for field identification, night monkey identifications are usually justified by making assumptions about geographic range limits. Our attempt to identify collected specimens of night monkeys from the Yavarí-Ucayali interfluve, however, suggests that the current taxonomy is itself based on inadequately documented distributional assumptions. Aotus nancymaae Hershkovitz, 1983 VOUCHER MATERIAL : Marupa , Nuevo San Juan , Orosa , Quebrada Esperanza . UNVOUCHERED RECORDS: Actiamë , Choncó , Divisor , Jenaro Herrera , Reserva Comunal Tamshiyacu-Tahuayo , Río Cochiquinas , Río Orosa , Río Tahuayo , Río Tapiche , Río Yavarí , Río Yavarí-Mirím , Tapiche . IDENTIFICATION: Night monkeys exhibit a limited range of phenotypic variation, mostly in pelage traits, and all of the named forms in this genus were once considered to belong to a single geographically variable species, Aotus trivirgatus . However, subsequent karyotypic research by R.A. Brumback and N.S.F. Ma revealed unexpected geographic variation in diploid numbers and fundamental numbers that they interpreted as evidence for multiple species. The hypothesis that at least some night monkey karyomorphs represent valid taxa is supported by a variety of data, including correlated pelage traits, comparative serology, and clinical responses to experimental infection with malaria parasites ; evidence of sympatry without apparent hybridization in the wild ; substantial mtDNA sequence divergence ; and reduced fertility in at least some hybrid pairings . Together, these and other results effectively refute earlier notions that Aotus is monotypic, but many taxonomic issues remain unresolved. The most frequently cited phenotypic character in the recent literature on Aotus concerns the coloration of the fur of the neck. The so-called ''red-necked'' and ''graynecked'' phenotypes are defined by the presence or absence, respectively, of a lateral extension of the reddish ventral coloration along the neck below and behind the ear . Allegedly, the gray-necked forms of Aotus occur north of the Amazon, and red-necked forms occur south of the Amazon, but Hershkovitz discussed some exceptions to this geographic pattern and others are indicated by specimens that we examined . Although neck coloration is commonly used as the basis for recognizing species groups of Aotus , recent sequencing studies do not support the reciprocal monophyly of gray-necked and red-necked night monkeys . The original description of Aotus nancymaae was largely justified on the basis of karyotypic data, but no morphological voucher material of known geographic origin is apparently available for any chromosomal preparation attributed to this species, and existing vouchers of karyotyped laboratory animals do not consistently exhibit diagnostic pelage traits. 7 Instead, only indirect evidence is available to correlate chromosomes with phenotypes. According to Hershkovitz , unvouchered night monkey karyotypes prepared by N.S.F. Ma from blood samples obtained at Peruvian localities on the south bank of the Amazon all have 54 chromosomes and 72 autosomal arms , whereas most karyotypes from the north bank of the Peruvian Amazon have 2n 5 46 and FN 5 60. Hershkovitz attributed divergent pelage traits to these karyotypes by examining skins from north-bank and south-bank Peruvian localities. He identified the north-bank 2n 5 46 karyotype as belonging to the gray-necked species Aotus vociferans , and he described a new species of red-necked night monkey, A. nancymaae for the southbank 2n 5 54 karyotype. However, an allegedly unique enclave of red-necked night monkeys with 2n 5 54 chromosomes occurs along the lower Río Tigre, a north-bank tributary of the Amazon . 7 Of the two karyotypic vouchers of Aotus nancymaae mentioned by Hershkovitz, one is unambiguously red necked, but the other appears to be gray necked. Although Hershkovitz said that these specimens were from ''the series described by Brumback et al. ,'' the FMNH mammal catalog states they originated from the Johns Hopkins Hospital Primate Colony, whereas Brumback et al.'s material came from other institutions. Instead, FMNH 123032 and 123033 are probably two of the three Johns Hopkins specimens karyotyped by Brumback , who said they were collected in ''the Leticia, Colombia-Iquitos, Peru area of the Amazon Basin south [sic] of the Andes mountains'' .

By comparison, the black fur of Coendou melanurus-another species with short bicolored quills-is abundantly streaked with yellowish or whitish guard hairs : fig. 67 ), and the blackish fur of C. vestitus is not uniformly soft because it is intermingled with the wiry tips of long bristlequills .

Coendou quichua , the only other species of porcupine that occurs in Central America, differs from C. mexicanus by lacking emergent fur and by having tricolored quills scattered throughout its dorsal pelage. The contrasting external features of C. mexicanus and C. quichua are clearly illustrated in Reid . Coendou mexicanus is geographically variable. Throughout its range, highland specimens usually have longer and denser fur than lowland specimens, and some populations differ in size and qualitative cranial traits. Panamanian specimens , for example, have less inflated frontal sinuses than Mexican specimens, and also have much shorter tails, smaller hind feet, and narrower nasal apertures . A careful study of geographic variation in these characters would be welcome, as would complementary phylogeographic analyses of mtDNA sequence variation within this widespread species.

Remarks: The authorship of this species has often been misattributed; see Voss and Angermann for nomenclatural details. Olfers' original Latin description of Coendou nycthemera is virtually useless, but detailed morphological descriptions were provided by Handley and Pine , Emmons and Feer , and Voss and Angermann . This species has historically been confused with C. bicolor, a substantially larger western Amazonian species. Specimens examined: See Voss and Angermann . ley, 1976; Husson, 1978) and southward throughout most of the forested cis-Andean lowlands of Ecuador, Peru, and Brazil to eastern Bolivia , northwestern Argentina , and eastern Paraguay . It seems probable that C. prehensilis also occurs in western Paraguay, but no specimens or sightings have apparently been reported from the region. Remarks: Because it was originally based on vernacular descriptions of several different species, Linnaeus's concept of Hystrix prehensilis was composite. Nineteenth-century usage followed Kerr , who restricted the application of this name to the eastern Brazilian porcupine described by Marcgraf . Thomas recommended that the type locality should be construed as Pernambuco, where Marcgraf principally resided while he was in Brazil. Because Thomas's recommendation was not nomenclaturally binding, however, and because the porcupines currently referred to Coendou prehensilis may comprise more than one valid taxon, Leite et al. appropriately designated a neotype. 3 The best descriptions of this species are in Husson and Leite et al. , both of whom illustrate its distinctive external and craniodental morphology. This is a large, long-tailed porcupine, adult specimens of which appear to be completely spiny because they lack emergent fur; the longest dorsal quills of most specimens are tricolored , even over the rump; the frontal sinuses of adults and subadults are always inflated; the nasal aperture is very wide; and the upper incisors are distinctly procumbent. As remarked by Leite et al. , Coendou prehensilis may be a complex of closely related forms, but I have not discovered any morphological character by which different nominal taxa herein treated as subjective junior synonyms can be unambiguously diagnosed. The following remarks summarize known patterns of geographic variation in phenotypic traits and discuss the application of available names should any taxa merit formal recognition in future revisionary studies. The largest specimens I have measured are from central Brazil and eastern Bolivia and the smallest are from northern Colombia . The latter were described as a distinct species by Allen , who claimed that they were about one-third smaller than Brazilian specimens, but Allen underestimated the mature size of this nominal taxon by failing to take ontogenetic variation into account . In fact, measurements of adult specimens from northern Colombia overlap with those of central Brazilian specimens in most dimensions , and these samples do not appear to differ in other external or craniodental features. 6.1 ± 0.5 15 6.2 ± 0.5 9 a Tabulated statistics include the sample mean plus or minus one standard deviation , the observed range , and the sample size. b From Cesar and Magdalena: AMNH 15459, 15460, 23471; USNM 281897, 281898, 281901-281906, 281908, 281909, 281912, 281914, 281916 . c From Minas Gerais, Goiás, and Mato Grosso: AMNH 1256/356, 134062, 134064, 134067, 134069, 134070; ANSP 4802; BMNH 1.11.3.70, 3.7.7.101, 3.7.7.102 ; ZMUC 521 . The epithet sanctaemartae is available should populations of Coendou prehensilis in northern South America merit subspecific recognition, but longicaudatus is an older name. Although I have not measured French Guianan material nor directly compared any specimens from the Guianas with northern Colombian material, measurements of Surinamese specimens suggest that Guianan populations are closer in size to central Brazilian than to northern Colombian animals. A third northern South American name, brandtii, is a junior synonym of longicaudatus . 4 In the event that any prehensilis-like northern South American porcupine merits recognition as a distinct taxon, a French Guianan neotype should be designated to fix the application of longicaudatus. The name platycentrotus is based on a mummified specimen of unknown geographic origin. Its quills are longitudinally grooved , possibly a developmental pathology or an artifact of having once been fluid filled and subsequently dessicated. In either case, they are surely not taxonomically diagnostic, and the specimen otherwise resembles ordinary material of Coendou prehensilis. Although the name has been applied to central Brazilian populations based on conjectures about where the type might have been collected , it seems best regarded as a nomen dubium. Gray 1850named boliviensis based on a specimen obtained by one Mr. Bridges, who is said to have collected it in the vicinity of Santa Cruz de la Sierra in eastern Bolivia . The holotype consists of the skin and skull of a very old animal, which plausibly accounts for its unusually large skull and proportionately small cheek teeth . Another distinctive trait of this specimen, its grooved upper incisors, appears to be an individual peculiarity. In all other respects, Mr. Bridge's porcupine closely resembles others collected in eastern Bolivia, as well as those from the contiguous dry forests of central Brazil. Gray also proposed the name tricolor for a specimen of unknown origin that was said to be darker than other prehensilis-like specimens then preserved at the British Museum. Although the type of tricolor is, in fact, darker than other mid 19th-century BMNH specimens, it is not sufficiently distinctive to justify the use of this name for any known geographic form of Coendou prehensilis in the absence of definite information about where it was collected. According to Moojen , the type locality of tricolor is Igarapé-açu , but I am not aware of any documentary evidence that the type was actually collected there. Thomas named centralis based on a specimen with less swollen frontal sinuses than other sympatrically collected specimens that he referred to brandtii. Although Thomas believed the observed disparity in sinus inflation \"too great to be due to individual variation\" , cranial differences between BMNH 3.7.7.102 and other porcupines from Chapada dos Guimarães do not exceed those that can be found within several series of Coendou prehensilis from other localities, such as the AMNH material from Anápolis or the USNM material from Valledupar. To be fair, such large series were unavailable in Thomas's day, so the individual variability of the species could not have been accurately assessed at the time. In effect, centralis is taxonomically indistinguishable from the eastern Bolivian phenotype to which the older name boliviensis unambiguously applies . Collectively, this material is conspicuously paler than the Pernambuco neotype of prehensilis , and side-by-side comparisons might reveal additional differences on which a taxonomic diagnosis could be based. That eastern and central Brazilian populations of C. prehensilis merit such scrutiny is suggested by cytochrome-b sequence analyses indicating substantial genetic divergence between them , but it would be prudent to defer formal recognition of any taxa here treated as synonyms of C. prehensilis until more comprehensive genetic sampling and morphometric analyses of this widespread species are available.

Coendou bicolor richardsoni: Cabrera, 1961 : 598 . Distribution: I have examined specimens of Coendou quichua from Panama, western Ecuador , and trans-Andean Colombia . Alberico et al. reported several Colombian specimens that I have not seen. Altitudes recorded on specimen labels suggest that the species ranges from sea level to about 3300 m. Remarks: Coendou quichua was treated as a subspecies of C. bicolor by Cabrera , and it is still listed as such by Woods and Kilpatrick . However, it is not clear whether or not Cabrera, Woods, or Kilpatrick ever examined specimens of these strikingly dissimilar taxa. Among other conspicuous differences, C. quichua is substantially smaller than C. bicolor , its longest quills are usually tricolored , its frontal sinuses are not or only slightly inflated , and the roof of its external auditory meatus usually has a well-developed transverse bony ridge . Although the name quichua has traditionally been associated with Ecuadorean material, Panamanian specimens hitherto referred to rothschildi are phenotypically similar and appear to be part of a single widespread but geographically variable trans-Andean species. Thomas are larger than Ecuadorian specimens, are more strongly speckled with white and have more inflated frontal sinuses, wider nasal apertures, and relatively smaller premolars. In fact, Ecuadorean and Panamanian specimens are about equal in size, as indexed by head-and-body length or maxillary toothrow length , but there are some noteworthy morphometric contrasts among representative samples . In particular, Ecuadorean specimens have much shorter tails than Panamanian specimens , smaller hind feet, and much narrower nasal apertures. However, most Ecuadorean specimens are from montane localities , whereas most Panamanian specimens are from lowlands and foothills, and this same suite of morphological differences Remarks: This species may be closely related to Coendou ichillus, C. pruinosus, and C. vestitus , all of which also have bristle-quills in addition to ordinary defensive quills and soft fur in their dorsal pelage. Diagnostic comparisons with those species were provided by Voss and da Silva , whose text should also be consulted for a detailed description of the skin and skull of C. roosmalenorum.

Echinoprocta rufescens: Cabrera, 1901: 159 . Coendou sneiderni Lönnberg, 1937: 17 ; type locality \"Munchique, Cauca\" in the Cordillera Occidental of Colombia. Coendou rufescens: Alberico et al., 1999: 606 . Distribution: Based on examined specimens and credible literature records, Coendou rufescens occurs in all three Andean cordilleras of Colombia , on both slopes of the Ecuadorean Andes, in northern Peru , and in northern Bolivia . Elevations recorded on specimen tags and in the literature document an elevational range from about 800 to 3500 m above sea level, but most records are clustered in the interval from 1500 to 3000 m . Remarks: This species has long been referred to the monotypic genus Echinoprocta, but there is no compelling evidence that rufescens is anything other than a short-tailed species of Coendou. Because the retention of Echinoprocta as a distinct genus does not appear to be motivated by any defensible hypothesis of reciprocal monophyly, I follow Alberico et al. in treating it as a subjective junior synonym of Coendou. Subsequent to Gray's original description, this species was redescribed by Cabrera , Trouessart , Lönnberg , and Alberico et al. . As noted by Alberico et al. , most specimens have a naked, calloused patch of skin on the dorsal surface of the tip of the tail, suggesting that this organ is prehensile like those of other Neotropical porcupines . The holotype of Coendou rufescens is a young adult with newly erupted P4 and unfused cranial sutures. The skin is in excellent condition, but the skull is fragmentary: the dentition is complete, but the occiput and most of the basicranium is missing, as is the right zygoma, most of the left zygoma, both nasals, and most of the premaxillae. In fact, the only taxonomically useful measurement that can be taken is length of the maxillary tooth row , which is 15.6 mm. By comparison, the maxillary tooth rows of nine adult specimens collected in the Cordillera Occidental of Colombia range from 16.7 to 19.2 mm, whereas the same dimension in two adults from the Cordillera Oriental of Ecuador are 16.7 and 17.4 mm. Thus, the tooth row of the type is shorter than those of other specimens that I refer to C. rufescens. Alberico et al. plausibly suggested that the type was collected somewhere in the Cordillera Oriental of Colombia, from which additional material should be examined for any future revisionary study. 5 The single Bolivian specimen I examined is morphologically indistinguishable from Colombian and Ecuadorian material that I directly compared with it. The specimen is a very young adult , which plausibly explains its small values for some age-dependent dimensions . I am, frankly, at a loss to explain how this species could be distributed over thousands of kilometers of highly dissected terrain with negligible geographic variation. Perhaps it is not fanciful to think that the Inca, who transplanted whole human populations from one end of the Andes to the other, might also have transported captive stock of this strikingly beautiful rodent over equivalent distances. Woods and Kilpatrick listed epixanthus Martínez as a synonym of this species, but Martínez simply applied the name epixanthus Brandt, 1835-a synonym of Erethizon 5 Although these authors \"restricted\" the type locality of Coendou rufescens to \"Quebrada Susumuco, 13 km WNW Villavicencio\" in the Colombian department of Cundinamarca , there appears to be no evidence that the type was actually collected there. Remarks: The specimens I refer to Coendou spinosus are small to medium-size porcupines with long tricolored quills intermingled with shorter bicolored quills over most of the dorsal surface. Most specimens have long fur, the individual hairs of which are blackish basally but have pale tips; in some specimens the fur is long enough to conceal the underlying quills over much of the body, but in other specimens the fur is sparser and lies over the quills in scattered tufts, and a few skins completely lack long fur . The ventral pelage consists entirely of soft fur. The mystacial vibrissae and the stiff bristles on the underside of the tail are usually bicolored: blackish basally with yellowish or orange tips. The frontal sinuses are not inflated and the dorsal roof of the external auditory meatus is smooth . By comparison, Coendou insidiosus differs from C. spinosus by having only short bicolored quills; pale-based or completely pale fur ; unicolored mystacial vibrissae and caudal bristles; and shorter tooth rows . Coendou nycthemera, another small species that occurs in eastern Brazil, differs from C. spinosus by consistently lacking long dorsal fur, by having spiny 5 5 BNA 9.7 8 10.8 4 11.6 7 BB 31.2 8 33.0 6 31.9 4 DI 3.2 8 3.6 7 3.5 7 BIT 4.4 8 4.9 7 4.8 7 a Table entries include the mean, observed range , and sample size for each measurement. b BMNH 2.4.7.28, 2.4.7.29, 25.5.1.10; MSB 54078; UMMZ 68132; USNM 115122, 115123; ZMB 35756 . c BMNH 3.7.1.98a, 3.7.1.99, 3.7.1.100, 3.7.1.102, 14. 5.9.17, 14.5.9.18, 29.6.6.67-29.6.6 .69 . d BMNH 92.11.24.1, 92.11.24.2, 98.1.6.1, 2.11.8.14; MCZ 1832; USNM 259793, 259838 . ventral pelage, by having unicolored mystacial vibrissae and caudal bristles, and perhaps in other diagnostic traits described by Handley and Pine but not carefully evaluated for this report. Geographic variation among examined specimens that I refer to this species includes modest size differences between Paraguayan and Brazilian samples and the more saturated pigments of specimens from more northern localities by comparison with those from southern localities. Whereas skins from Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo usually have orange-tipped tricolored quills and orange-highlighted fur, specimens from Rio Grande do Sul and Paraguay usually have yellow-tipped tricolored quills and fur that is washed with pale yellow dorsally and pale gray ventrally. Because geographically intermediate specimens seem intermediate in pelage characters, this pigmental variation could plausibly be interpreted as clinal. One specimen from Espírito Santo has pale-gray fur, superficially resembling that of Coendou insidiosus. This species was first described by Azara , who used the vernacular name \"couiy\" for a small Paraguayan porcupine with tricolored quills mixed with long fur. Azara's description served as the basis for paragayensis Oken, 1816, but Oken's names are technically unavailable . Another epithet based on Azara's porcupine is couiy Desmarest, 1822, but this is a nomen oblitum that does not appear to have ever been used by 20th-century authors as a valid name; under Article 23.9 of the current code , it cannot replace spinosus F. Cuvier, 1823, which is the name now commonly used for the small Paraguayan species . Frédéric Cuvier's important essay on porcupine taxonomy, \"Examen des espèces du genre porc-épic .

{"text": "Myotis simus was described by LaVal as ''usually bright orange or somewhat duller, varying from cinnamonbrown to cinnamon; tips not contrasting; below, hairs longer, tips yellow, bases Baud and Menu considered that the ochraceous coloration might be an effect of preservation rather than a natural feature. Specimens they studied were all mummy-brown and never ochraceous. The specimen of M. simus collected by us at Ayolas, Misiones, Paraguay, was a bright orange animal when alive. After a year of storage, the dry skin became ochraceous-brown, the same color as in some of the series from the Amazon Basin at AMNH and specimens from Bolivia. Dark, cinnamon-red individuals also occurred , and the red coloration remained after 15 years of storage in a museum. Other specimens from the same areas were dull brown, as described by Baud and Menu . We detected no geographic pattern to color variation, although apparent lack of a pattern may have resulted from change in color of specimens across time. Fringe of hair at the edge of the uropatagium was a diagnostic feature within species. It separated M. albescens and M. levis, which have a fringed uropatagium, from all other Paraguayan species. Some Paraguayan specimens of M. nigricans and M. riparius had a few hairs at the edge of the uropatagium that were sparse and required magnification to be seen. Presence or absence of a sagittal crest was a useful character to separate species in Paraguay . Intraspecific variation in degree of development of crests was minimal. All Paraguayan M. riparius had a crest, as did all examined specimens of M. ruber and M. simus. In a large sample of M. simus examined by LaVal , only 8 of 67 specimens lacked a sagittal crest. The P3 crowded to the lingual side was a diagnostic character for M. simus ; only 1 specimen of M. simus examined by us lacked that condition. Although M. riparius was described based on specimens with a crowded P3 , much variation in that trait occurred in that species. In Paraguay, only 16 of 59 specimens examined had P3 crowded to the lingual side, whereas 84 of 86 specimens from Central and South America had a crowded P3 . No geographic pattern in crowding was detected. This condition also occurred sporadically in M. nigricans. No single character sufficiently differentiated species of Myotis in Paraguay, except for insertion of the plagiopatagium at the level of the ankle, which separated M. simus externally from other species of Neotropical Myotis. The remaining species could be separated by a combination of the aforementioned pelage characteristics and cranial features . However, combinations of character states considered as diagnostic of species were not present in all specimens, reducing ability to make positive identification using only qualitative characters. Quantitative variation.-Because of small samples, secondary sexual dimorphism was not examined in M. ruber. Sexual differences in cranial morphology were not significant in any remaining species based on univariate or multivariate analyses, but sex by locality interaction was significant for greatest length of skull, condylobasal length, and length of maxillary toothrow in M. levis . The corresponding effect also was significant in the multivariate test . Interlocality differences also were significant in the multivariate test for M. levis . Significant geographic differences consistently were found for condylocanine length, mastoid breadth, zygomatic breadth, interorbital constriction, and length of maxillary toothrow . M. riparius differed significantly across localities according to MANOVA. However, univariate results were significant only for 1 character after adjustment; specimens from the Amazon Basin were larger for breadth across upper molars . The locality effect was highly significant in the MANOVA for M. simus . Specimens of M. simus from the Amazon Basin were significantly smaller than those from outside the Basin in 7 characters, and Bolivian specimens were significantly larger than those from Paraguay in 4 of those characters . Neither geographic variation nor sexual dimorphism was detected for M. nigricans or M. albescens. The PCA illustrated major trends in cranial morphology for populations examined . PC1 accounted for 70% of total variation in the sample and represented a general size axis. Smaller taxa had low or negative scores, whereas larger species had high, positive scores on that component. Because within-species variance was large compared with intertaxon differences for most variables, size alone did not discriminate among those species, with the possible exception of M. ruber. PC2 and PC3 indicated shape differences among taxa . Based on shape, 3 distinct groups of specimens were formed, M. albescens, M. simus, and the 4 remaining species . First and 2nd axes in the size-adjusted discriminant function analysis showed about the same relationship among species as did PC2 and PC3, except that, as expected, groups were more distinct . The first 3 discriminant axes accounted for 96.7% of total variation among taxa after size adjustment . That analysis also allowed recognition of 3 distinct cranial morphologies: M. albescens, M. simus, and the remaining species as a group . Relationships among M. levis, M. nigricans, M. ruber, and M. riparius were less clear, suggesting little speciesspecific differentiation in shape among those taxa. A relatively broad interorbital Table 4 and species codes as in Baud and Menu , was classified as M. albescens in 100% of 1,000 iterations in the bootstrapped DFA. Unlike many vespertilionids, in which females are larger than males , no significant difference in size between sexes was found for any species of Myotis from Paraguay. Although Myers and Wetzel found significant sexual dimorphism in Paraguayan M. albescens, they considered differences to be sufficiently small to allow for pooling sexes in morphometric analyses. Similarly, Willig found no significant sexual dimorphism in M. riparius from northeastern Brazil. Significance of the locality by sex in- teraction in M. levis may represent different expressions of sexual dimorphism in each subspecies, but because of small samples available and the high degree of overlap in size between them , these results must be interpreted with caution. Significant, albeit slight, geographic differences in cranial and external characters have been reported in M. nigricans and M. albescens from Bolivia, Chaco Boreal, and eastern Paraguay . Lack of significance for M. nigricans and M. albescens examined here may be the result of not including Bolivian specimens, which were the most differentiated in samples examined by Myers and Wetzel . In their analysis, differences between east and west were only marginally significant, with Chacoan specimens averaging 1-2% larger than eastern specimens. M. nigricans and M. albescens show opposite clinal trends in size south of the Amazon Basin ; M. nigricans is smaller to the south, whereas M. albescens increases in size with latitude. Geographic variation reported by Myers and Wetzel may reflect these clinal trends because the specimens used in their analyses were from a sample that largely followed a transect from the Bolivian Chaco south-southeast to eastern Paraguay. No geographic variation in size has been detected in M. riparius from Venezuela to eastern Peru to Uruguay . Specimens from western Paraguay were smaller than individuals from the eastern region in previous analysis . However, small samples precluded powerful statistical analysis of geographic variation in M. riparius. Our results reflect those of previous authors, although multivariate results were significant, only 1 of the variables examined was significant, and no pattern is apparent in variation of characters examined. Geographic differences may exist among populations of this species across its range, but available evidence is not sufficient to draw incontrovertible conclusions or to determine if a pattern exists. Geographic variation in M. simus had not been recorded previously. Specimens from the Southern Cone were larger than those from the Amazon Basin . In turn, Bolivian and Paraguayan specimens differed significantly in cranial measurements. Nonetheless, we believe designation of subspecies in this taxon is not warranted because no matching geographic pattern occurs in differences in coloration or any other external features examined so far. A comprehensive study of the entire range of the species would be necessary to evaluate the extent of interpopulational variation. Despite variation in size, shape of skull is consistent across populations within species. Neither PCA nor DFA suggested any distinct populations below the specific level. Five species are recognized for Paraguay: Myotis albescens, M. nigricans, M. riparius, M. ruber, and M. simus. DF1 was correlated highly and positively with characters related to length of rostrum and toothrows and negatively correlated with width of cranial vault and interorbital constriction. M. albescens and M. simus have a short rostrum, broad cranial vault, and wide interorbital constriction, whereas the remaining species have the opposite characteristics. Scores on DF2 were related to relative length of braincase with respect to total length of skull. DF2 was correlated negatively with characters related to width of rostrum and braincase. M. albescens and M. simus are essentially indistinguishable along the 1st axis but differed along the 2nd axis; M. simus has wider base of skull, wider rostrum, and shorter braincase. M. albescens has a comparatively narrow base of skull, which, together with the wider vault, confers the characteristic, globose appearance of its braincase. We concluded that M. levis has not been documented for Paraguay. The only specimen from Paraguay previously identified as M. levis has the cranial morphology of M. albescens. Additionally, dorsal pelage of this individual is long and dark, with frosted tips. Although the spec-imen is relatively large and frosted hair-tips occur in M. l. levis from São Paulo, Brazil , the specimen has a short rostrum, globose braincase, and wide interorbital constriction, which firmly place it within M. albescens. Nonetheless, the known distribution of M. levis in northern Argentina and southern Brazil suggests that it may occur in Paraguay. Although different in size and coloration, M. l. levis and M. l. dinellii are similar in cranial shape. Degree of cranial resemblance is comparable to that between M. nigricans and M. riparius , which are considered distinct species. In fact, M. levis and M. dinellii were described originally as species and subsequently relegated to subspecies of M. chiloensis by Miller and Allen , assigned by Cabrera to M. ruber, and referred to as M. levis by LaVal . Under LaVal's definition , M. levis occurs in southeastern Brazil, Uruguay, and Argentina. He recognized 2 major groups, M. l. levis from southeastern Brazil to Uruguay and M. l. dinellii from northwestern and southern Argentina. LaVal distinguished the 2 forms by size and color and remarked that differences between them were striking. M. l. levis is large with broad color variation across its range . M. l. dinellii, conversely, is smaller, with long, silky, strongly bicolored fur . Nonetheless, differentiation of these 2 forms is far from clear. Specimens from Argentina can be separated by size . However, specimens from Entre Ríos Province, Argentina, were intermediate between M. l. levis and M. l. dinellii . Our samples, which included specimens from Bolivia, Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay, were significantly different in size for only 4 of 14 cranial characters. We included specimens from Bolivia not available to LaVal, which ex-tended the range of size measurements for M. l. dinellii to overlap with that of the nominate subspecies in most measurements. LaVal suggested the existence of an intergradation zone between the 2 forms, or else possibility that they represented different species, but no data were available from intermediate areas to draw definitive conclusions. However, externally, the Bolivian material shows the characteristic coloration of M. l. dinellii . Although more material is available now, sample sizes are still insufficient to assess geographic variation in M. levis with statistical reliability. Clearly, populations now included as M. levis await thorough examination; additional, nonmorphologic information may help clarify taxonomic boundaries. Quantitative indices have been used to distinguish among Paraguayan species of Myotis. Cranial and maxillary indices describe different aspects of the skull . Maxillary index is a measure of size of rostrum; thus, M. albescens has smaller maxillary index, whereas M. levis would have large values. Cranial index is a measure of breadth of braincase and cranial vault; M. nigricans has small cranial indices, whereas M. albescens and M. ruber have large values. Clearly, these indices reflect overall cranial size. As such, they show a high degree of overlap and by themselves are of little use in separating species. Baud and Menu used them in combination, creating biplots of maxillary versus cranial index. Such biplots successfully separated M. ruber from the remaining species. LaVal used ratio of breadth across canines to interorbital constriction as a taxonomic character to separate species. This ratio is useful to separate M. albescens from the remaining species in most cases, although not consistently so designated a monotypic subgenus, Hesperomyotis, to include M. simus, based on its high degree of morphologic divergence from congeners. Our results indicate that degree of differentiation of M. simus is similar to that in M. albescens or M. ruber. With the evidence at hand, we see no reason to consider M. simus to belong to a different subgenus. A small species of Myotis, and the most distinctive of those occurring in Paraguay. Dorsal fur ranges from pale to dark brown or almost black, tipped with golden yellow or silvery white, resulting in a frosted appearance. Individual dorsal hairs are long ; ventral hairs are dark brown with buffy tips. Coloration of pelage ranges from almost black to sandy brown, always with frosted tips. Some specimens have Ն1 patches of rusty-brown or black hair on the dorsum. No difference in color was detected between specimens from eastern and western Paraguay. The plagiopatagium attaches to the toes . A fringe of hairs is present on the posterior border of the uropatagium, although it may be difficult to see without magnification. This character is consistent throughout Paraguay. The skull is of moderate size , with little forehead slope, and a narrow, short rostrum. Cranial vault and interorbital constriction are wide relative to size of skull. These characters separate M. albescens from all other species . External characteristics separate M. albescens from all other species of Paraguayan Myotis , except for M. levis and M. nigricans, which may have similar coloration. However, its globose cranial vault, short rostrum, and proportionally wider postorbital constriction suffice to separate it. Distribution.-Myotis albescens occurs throughout Paraguay, although it seems more common in the west . Remarks.-Although clinal variation in size exists for Mato Grosso , Paraguay, and Uruguay, no subspecies have been recognized . Reproductive biology and natural history have been described by Myers . M. albescens shares roosts with M. nigricans in the Paraguayan Pantanal. Findley classified this species as a forest and clearing aerial insectivore. Myotis nigricans This is the most common species of Myotis in Paraguay and on average the smallest . The dorsal pelage is silky. Coloration ranges from black on bases and tips of hairs in the eastern region, to sandy brown on tips with darker bases in the northwestern Chaco. Wing membranes insert at toes . Both rostrum and braincase are narrow, and upper molariform teeth usually are arranged in a row, although in a few specimens , P3 is crowded to the lingual side. M. nigricans usually lacks a sagittal crest, although some specimens from Fuerte Olimpo, Departamento Alto Paraguay, have a low, barely perceptible sagittal crest. However, pelage characteristics place these specimens in M. nigricans. This species is distinguishable externally from congeners in Paraguay by color, length and texture of hair, and overall size . M. nigricans can be confused only with M. riparius; these 2 species are more similar to each other than to any other Paraguayan species in size or shape of skull. However, M. nigricans generally is smaller, the ratio of interorbital constriction to breadth of canines usually is Ͻ1 , and M. nigricans lacks a sagittal crest, which is present in M. riparius. In Paraguay, pelage of M. riparius is not as distinctive as it is in more northern areas of South America and resembles that of M. nigricans. Some Paraguayan specimens reported previously in the literature as M. nigricans actually may be referable to M. riparius. Distribution.-Widely distributed throughout Paraguay in eastern and western regions . Remarks. -Four or 5 subspecies of M. nigricans have been recognized. Under either interpretation, Paraguayan populations can be ascribed to the nominate subspecies. M. nigricans has been found sharing roosts with M. albescens in the Paraguayan Pantanal. Reproductive patterns in Paraguay were described by Myers . Females give birth in spring and summer and probably continue at low frequency during autumn and winter. Males are aseasonal with regard to their testis cy- cle, no storage of sperm has been found in either males or females. Findley classified M. nigricans as a forest and clearing aerial insectivore. Myotis riparius Myotis riparius has short and woolly fur, buffy-brown dorsum, and individual hairs slightly burnished at the tips and slightly grayer toward the bases . Cinnamon-red specimens also may exist . The wing membrane attaches to the base of toes . The type specimen is large in external measurements , but with a comparatively small skull . The skull is long and narrow, and well-developed sagittal and lambdoidal crests are present. P3 is crowded to the lingual side in the type specimen. Broad variation in size exists among Paraguayan specimens. Nonetheless, M. riparius averages larger than M. nigricans. Dorsal pelage may not be as short and markedly woolly as it is in more northern specimens, and P3 is not always crowded to the lingual side in Paraguayan M. riparius. Moreover, P3 is crowded in some M. nigricans, which may make individuals difficult to identify. However, presence of a sagittal crest , the ratio interorbital constriction to breadth across canines Ͻ1, and shorter fur, are sufficient to distinguish M. riparius from M. nigricans when both skin and skull are available. M. riparius is distinguished easily from other species of Myotis in Paraguay by coloration and skull proportions. Distribution.-Most Paraguayan specimens have been collected in forested areas of the eastern region, although a few have been caught in the lower Chaco . No records are known from the dry Chaco. Remarks. -Little geographic variation has been detected in this species across its range , and no subspecies are recognized. According to LaVal associated with gallery forests that forages over water. Nonetheless, LaVal and Fitch reported 78 individuals of this species in the rainforest of La Selva, Costa Rica, collected well away from riparian environments. Myotis ruber Myotis ruber is a large distinctive bat. Dorsal pelage is bright cinnamon-red, relatively short, but silky, and monocolored or only slightly bicolored. The dorsal surface of the uropatagium is covered with hair to the level of the knees. The venter is yellowish, with dark brown bases. The plagiopatagium attaches at the toes . The skull is robust, large, and wide at its base; the rostrum is long and relatively wide, interorbital constriction is narrow, and sagittal crest is well developed. In Paraguay, M. ruber is distinguishable from other congeners by size and coloration . Because of similar size, the cranium can be confused with that of M. simus, which, however, differs in the position of P3, in having longer rostrum, narrower cranial vault, and ratio of interorbital constriction to breadth across canines Ͻ1. Distribution.-All known Paraguayan records are from the southeastern corner of the country, Departamento Itapua, and from Sapucai, Departamento Paraguari. M. ruber inhabits low semideciduous forests and is a rare bat throughout its distribution . Remarks. -Baud and Menu described M. ruber from Paraguay in a manner consistent with characters given by LaVal and clearly recognized differences between it and M. simus. Nevertheless, they assigned 2 clear M. simus , under their own definition and that of LaVal , to M. ruber. Skulls of M. simus and M. ruber are markedly different in shape . Both PCA and DFA placed these 2 specimens within M. simus. Additionally, both individuals have the characteristic short wooly pelage of M. simus, and insertion of the plagiopatagium is not at the toes. No subspecies are recognized . Myotis simus This is a large Myotis with extremely short woolly fur. Dorsal color ranges from a bright orange in fresh specimens to cinnamon-brown, to cinnamon. Tips of hairs do not contrast with bases on dorsal pelage. On the venter, hairs are slightly longer, with yellow tips and slightly darker bases. Membranes are dark brown to black. Unlike other Myotis in Paraguay, the plagiopatagium attaches at the level of the tarsals . This combination of characters externally distinguishes Paraguayan M. simus from other congeners. Large size, presence of a well-developed sagittal crest, crowding of P3 to the lingual side, relatively short, wide rostrum, wide base of skull, and short toothrow characterize M. simus cranially. In Paraguay, M. simus can be confused only with M. ruber because of their similarity in general and size of braincase , but they differ in shape of rostrum. Other characters useful to distinguish the 2 species are discussed in the account for M. ruber. Distribution.-Scattered records are available from the lower Chaco, the vicinity of Asunción, and Ayolas, Departamento Misiones .

Remarks.-Myotis simus was originally believed to be confined to the Amazon Basin . More recently, it has been caught in Bolivia , Paraguay , and Argentina . Baud and Menu redefined the species, arguing that some of the most important characters used to distinguish it, insertion of the plagiopatagium at the tarsal level and a larger canine, had been misinterpreted or disregarded by previous authors. Based on a sample of South American Myotis, they concluded that M. simus was restricted effectively to the Amazon Basin, and it was never orange or ochraceous. Furthermore, they assigned Paraguayan M. simus to M. ruber. However, their sample was small and, by chance, included specimens with brown-colored fur. Specimens AMNH 71484-71486 for instance, are certainly not orange or cinnamon-red, as are other individuals from the Amazon Basin.

These results all suggest that in the australopithecines, but not in humans, the ventral arc is disjunct from the absolute and relative lengths of the pubis and iliopectineal line. Consequently, we question use of the ventral arc for ascertaining gender in the australopithecines. 6 Pelvic funnelling reported that AL 288-1's pelvis is more funnel-shaped measurement of Sts 14 was based on a Transvaal Museum cast of the left hipbone that is in the collections of Kent State University, and not on reconstruction. 5 Calculation of this index required some reconstruction of the ischium of Sts 14. Häusler & Schmid carried out such reconstruction and noted as follows: ''the ischial tuberosities of Sts 14 were reconstructed according to the models of AL 288-1 and AL 129-52'' . 6 We do not agree with assessment of the ventral arc in the two australopithecine specimens, but will reserve our discussion with regard to this matter to a later publication. However, there is a fundamental difference between the two specimens-the presence of a clearly completed ventral rampart in AL 288-1, but an absence of any ventral rampart in Sts 14. This difference has a substantial effect on the interpretation of the position of the attachment of the common tendon of gracilis and adductor brevis on the two pubic corpora.  288-1:    the transverse diameter of the outlet is narrower than that of the inlet) than Sts 14's pelvis, and that this difference parallels the human condition in which human male pelves are more funnel-shaped than those of human females. However, based on Lovejoy's restoration of AL 288-1's pelvis, Tague & Lovejoy and Tague argued that both the transverse diameter of the outlet and the outlet's overall capacity were obstetrically adequate in AL 288-1 . If this conclusion is valid, then the funnel-shape of AL 288-1's pelvis is not meaningful for sexual identification in these earlier hominids. reported that AL 288-1 differs from Sts 14 in the same manner as do human males from females in the shape of the ischiopubic ramus. They reported that the medial aspect of the ramus is straight and broad beneath the pubic symphysis in AL 288-1 and human males, whereas in Sts 14 and human females the ramus is concave and has a ridge beneath the symphysis. In human females, the ischiopubic concavity enhances the capacity of the subpubic area and, thereby, facilitates fetal delivery through this space. First, we disagree with assessment of the form of the ischiopubic ramus in the australopithecine specimens. Both AL 288-1 and Sts 14 have remarkably similar ischiopubic rami, and the ramus of Sts 14 is essentially convex. Sts 14's ischiopubic ramus bears little or no relation to the true concave shape as seen in modern human females. Second, Tague & Lovejoy pointed out that the mechanism of birth in A. afarensis likely differed from that in humans, with the australopithecine fetus being delivered along the transverse axis of the outlet rather than through the subpubic space. Consequently, any ischiopubic concavity would not have been obstetrically relevant in A. afarensis. However, Berge et al. and argued that australopithecines had the same mechanism of birth as humans, and Stoller questioned the feasibility of the mechanism of birth proposed by Tague & Lovejoy . Third, and most important, Häusler & Schmid acknowledged that what slight differences that do exist between AL 288-1 and Sts 14 in the breadth and shape of the ischiopubic ramus may simply be artefacts of preservational bias: ''the marked differences between Sts 14 and AL 288-1 in the form and breadth of the inferior ischiopubic ramus are explained by erosion of the inferior rim of the ischiopubic ramus of Sts 14''. suggested that AL 288-1 differs from Sts 14 in the same manner as do human males from females in the development of muscle markings on the pelvis. In humans, such dimorphism is almost certainly a direct correlate of males being of larger body mass than females. However, body size dimorphism cannot account for a difference between AL 288-1 and Sts 14 in pelvic muscularity because reported that AL 288-1 and Sts 14 were equivalent in body size . This review of analysis shows that they employed criteria from three anatomical complexes inconsistently, and that their strategy of limiting the basis of australopithecine sex assignment to only those traits whose values fall within the modern human range of variation was not successful. Furthermore, as AL 288-1's pelvic outlet was probably 80 . .   . .  obstetrically sufficient , and as the mechanism of birth in A. afarensis may have differed from that of other hominids , the differences between AL 288-1 and Sts 14 in both the funnelling of the pelvic cavity and the subpubic area are also not relevant to sex determination. Consequently, we find analysis of pelvic dimorphism unconvincing. Obstetric adequacy of AL 288-1's pelvis argued that AL 288-1 was most probably male because its pelvis was obstetrically inadequate, relative to inferred newborn brain size, and that Sts 14 was female because its pelvis was obstetrically sufficient. They arrived at this conclusion by circuitous methods. Häusler & Schmid estimated the maximum brain size of a neonate that could pass successfully through AL 288-1's and Sts 14's pelves by identifying the ''critically small pelvis'' in human females that could deliver a newborn with a 382 g brain size. Based on line drawings, they determined ''the free space between the bony pelvis and the foetal skull [in humans] . . . [and] then proportionally transferred [this free space] to the pelvis of Sts 14 and AL 288-1. . . . In this way, it was possible to calculate the maximal neonatal head size . . . of the australopithecines'' . ", "meta": {"ref_id": "AL288‑1—LucyorLucifer"}}

Meristic traits of vertebral column indeterminate due to disarticulated condition of fossil samples. As underscored by our diagnosis, specimens of Noronhomys resemble those of Holochilus and Lundomys in many morphological features. The cranial similarities to Holochilus are many and include the comparatively large skulls with stoutly constructed zygomatic arches and reduced jugals; the relatively narrow constriction and amphorallike shape of the interorbit; the possession of vertically elongate postorbital ridges; the short, broad interparietal; the relatively short incisive foramina that terminate in front of the molar rows; the deeply recessed parapterygoid fossae; the absence of an alisphenoid strut; a derived carotid circulation and corresponding loss or occlusion of cranial foramina and vascular traces; and the conformation of the mandible and masseteric crests. Dental resemblances between Noronhomys and Holochilus are equally noteworthy: occlusal surfaces that are planar; pronounced involution of the enamel folds; reduction or absence of the mesoloph and loss of the mesolophid; broad anterocone lacking an anteromedian crease; presence of an internal enamel pit on ml; sigmodont form of the m3s; and presence of satellite roots on the upper and lower first molars. Considered together, the shared craniodental traits are sufficiently impressive to advance preliminary hypotheses of close phylogenetic relationship between Noronhomys and Holochilus and the more distant kinship of these two genera to Lundomys, hypotheses explored in broader phylogentic context in the next section. The weight of such similarities notwithstanding, substantial differences, both discrete and proportional, exist among these genera and warrant more detailed contrast. CRANIAL VAULT AND ORBITAL REGION: The skull of Noronhomys, although as robust as in Holochilus and Lundomys, has a flatter dorsal profile. The apex of the cranial vault occurs at about the middle of the parietals and slopes gently as a nearly straight line over the interorbit and rostrum. In contrast, the dorsal contour of the latter genera is evenly arched with the apex centered over the interorbital region . The stronger development of the dorsally di-1999 17 6h, L -Al I Fig. 9 . Occlusal view of right lower molars of adult Lundomys, Noronhomys, and Holochilus: A, L. molitor ; B, N. vespuccii ; C, H. brasiliensis ; and D, H. sciureus . rected supraorbital ridges of Holochilus perhaps exaggerates the dissimilarity in cranial profiles, but the interorbital construction of Lundomys more nearly resembles that of Noronhomys and still presents the same contrast in shape. The interorbital contour of all three genera is basically hourglass shaped and appears narrow relative to the expanse of the zygomatic arches . The dorsolateral margins of the frontals are squarely edged, not rounded, but do not form pronounced supraorbital shelves; slight supraorbital ledges do occur at the rear of the orbits in Holochilus and may be found in very old Lundomys and Noronhomys. Adult and older specimens of Holochilus possess a dorsally reflected supraorbital bead along the rear of the frontal, generally continued as a prominent temporal ridge over the squamosal and parietal. Even old adult Lundomys and Noronhomys lack such a raised bead but may exhibit temporal ridging of low relief. A rugose vertical crest or ridge, like that seen in Holochilus , marks the rear orbital wall of Noronhomys. A postorbital ridge is not developed in Lundomys. ZYGOMATIC REGION: The conformation of the maxillary root of the zygoma sets Noronhomys apart from both Holochilus and Lundomys. No anterodorsal spine is apparent in any of the six fossils that have the zygomatic plate suitably preserved. In each, the zygomatic notch appears relatively shallow, and the rostral border of the plate is nearly straight . Individuals of Holochilus and Lundomys, on the other hand, typically possess a protuberant anterodorsal spine, a feature that accentuates the depth of the zygomatic notch and the concavity along the forward margin of the plate . The position of the inferior root of the zygomatic arch, as observed relative to the molar rows . Lateral cranial profiles of adult representatives of A, Noronhomys vespuccii ; B, Lundomys molitor ; C, Holochilus sciureus ; and D, H. brasiliensis . The heavy vertical line approximates the position of the apex of the cranial vault when skulls are coaligned on a plane horizontal with their molar occlusal surfaces. and to the premaxillary-maxillary juncture, also differs. In Holochilus and Lundomys, the caudal border of the plate is set in front of the anterior root of the Mls, and its rostral border is situated well posterior to the suture of the premaxillary-maxillary bones. In Noronhomys, the rearward edge is situated more or less over the anterior root of Ml and the forward edge originates just behind the suture . As judged by the holotype of Noronhomys, which is the only specimen with a nearly complete arch, the jugal is small and irregularly defined, with the maxillary and squamosal processes of the arch being in contact. This condition, if representative of the taxon, agrees with that of Holochilus and departs from the consistently formed, larger jugal observed in Lundomys. The construction of the bony palate of Lundomys conforms to the long type , in which the posterior margin clearly extends behind the M3s. The long palate also characterizes adult specimens of H. brasiliensis, but in those of H. sciureus, it terminates more or less equal with the posterior margin of the M3s . In those examples of Noronhomys that have the palatal region in-tact, the hard palate reaches to only the middle of the M3s, and the mesopterygoid fossa correspondingly protrudes between them . Furthermore, the intermolar area of Noronhomys is relatively broad, without notable palatal gutters or a median longitudinal ridge as observed in mature examples of Lundomys and Holochilus. Variation in development of the posterolateral palatal pits may correlate with the posterior extent of the hard palate. These vascular foramina occur as highly perforated palatal recesses in both Holochilus and Lundomys; in Noronhomys, apparently homologous foramina penetrate the anterolateral walls of the mesopterygoid fossa but are not set within a conspicuous depression. ALISPHENOID REGION, OTIC CAPSULES, AND CRANIAL FORAMINA: A sturdy alisphenoid strut, separating the masticatory-buccinator and accessory oval foramina, can be verifed on several crania of Noronhomys. The strut is likewise present in members of Holochilus but is uniformly lacking in Lundomys . The auditory bullae of Noronhomys are moderately bulbous, shaped like those of Holochilus and Lundomys but less inflated. Fig. 11 .

In Lundomys, equally large temporal open-The apparently unequal size of the post-ings perforate the lateral wall of the brainglenoid foramen and subsquamosal fenestra case and define a thin, elongate hamular proand the short thick hamular process in Nocess . The damaged or partially concealed condition of the temporal region in the available fossil sample advises some caution in accepting these contrasts as typical of Noronhomys. In like manner, the slight dislocation of the bullae and their retention in so few specimens obscure the configuration of the tegmen tympani. The unmodified posteroventral edge of the squamosal nonetheless intimates that overlap and fitted contact are absent in Noronhomys, as has been described for other oryzomyines including Holochilus and Lundomys . Several fossil specimens with undamaged otic capsules have a pinhole-sized stapedial foramen that pierces the petrotympanic fissure. The reduced size of the stapedial foramen, together with the lack of a sphenofrontal foramen and squamosal-alisphenoid vascular groove and occlusion of the posterior opening to the alisphenoid canal, suggest that the orbitofacial circulation of Noronhomys originates mainly from the internal carotid instead of the stapedial artery . Such a tiny stapedial aperture occurs irregularly in individuals of Holochilus and Lundomys, genera that also have derived cephalic circulatory patterns . POSTCRANIAL SKELETON: Comparisons here emphasize aspects of the pelvic girdle, both because hind-limb bones were more frequently recovered as nearly intact or whole elements and because their morphology significantly relates to locomotory adaptations considered below. Although Noronhomys is contrasted with only H. brasiliensis in the illustrations , the differences noted are more exaggerated in the larger-bodied Lundomys and are generally less conspicuous in the smaller-bodied H. sciureus. The pelvis of Noronhomys is heavily constructed with a broad neck between the acetabulum and iliac blade. The greater circumference of its acetabulum , relative to those of Holochilus and Lundomys, is immediately obvious and predictably conforms to the wider diameter of the articular head of the femur . In Noronhomys, the femoral tubercle, a rugosity near the an-sgf Ĩ~g f terior lip of the acetabulum that provides origin for the rectus femoris muscle, is a small irregular mound; in both Holochilus and Lundomys, the tubercle forms a well-defined, conical eminence positioned farther craniad from the acetabulum . The lateral ridge in Noronhomys is gently rounded, the superior gluteal fossa broad and flat; the inferior gluteal fossa appears much smaller in area and faces more ventrad. In contrast, the innominates of Holochilus and Lundomys possess a more acute lateral ridge that scallops the lateral surface of the ilium, clearly demarcating the superior and inferior gluteal fossae; the inferior gluteal fossa is oriented more ventrolaterally, and its area is only slightly smaller than that of the superior fossa . The iliac crest in Holochilus and Lundomys also bends more conspicuously laterad and accentuates the curvature of the iliac blade. In general aspect, the long limb bones of Noronhomys are robust compared with the appendicular skeletons of Holochilus and Lundomys. This contrast is best conveyed by dimensions of the femur, the most abundant long bone recovered as intact fossils. Measurements of the head, neck, and shaft of the femur of Noronhomys typically exceed even those of H. brasiliensis or L. molitor , species that are considerably larger based on average femur length and craniodental size . The patellar fossa , the trough in which the patella slides, is shallow, short, and wide in Noronhomys but deeper, longer, and relatively narrow in Holochilus and Lundomys . The greater and lesser trochanters are developed similarly in all three genera; however, the lateral femoral crest of Noronhomys is scored by a shallow flute along its free edge, a feature not observed in Holochilus or Lundomys. The distal articular condyles are less rounded in Noronhomys, the breadth across their lateralmost edges being about equal to their anterior-posterior depth; the condyles of Holochilus and Lundomys are more bulbous and pulleylike in contour, their depth greater than the greatest width and the intercondyloid notch correspondingly deeper. The shape discrimination offered by these and other univariate differences are more readily appreciated in the multivariate analyses reported in the following section. In Noronhomys, the tibial crest forms a low, curved ridge that approximately bisects the anterior face of the upper tibia; the lateral tibial fossa is nearly flat and fully exposed in frontal view; and the crest is marked by a raised scar at its distal end where it merges with the shaft . In Holochilus and Lundomys, the tibial crest is straighter and displaced laterally, its anteromedial surface thus broad and smoothly convex; the lateral fossa is deeply concave and hence largely obscured in frontal view ; and no rugosity marks the distal end of the anterior crest. The medial and lateral ridges of No- ronhomys are short and low, defining a shallow posterior tibial fossa; in contrast, the posterior ridges of Holochilus and Lundomys are longer and project above the rear tibial surface, enfolding a cavernous caudal fossa . The proximal articular facets appear more convex on the tibiae of Holochilus and Lundomys, especially as observed in the posterior overhang of the lateral tuberosity. DENTITION: Voss and Carleton drew attention to the beveled edge and angular surface that mark the enamel face of the upper incisors in species of Holochilus. This faceted condition is more distinct in H. sciureus than in H. brasiliensis or Noronhomys. Moreover, the lower incisors in H. sci-ureus exhibit complementary development of an enamel facet and possess a wide, flattened lateral edge set off from a narrower medial bevel. Examples of H. brasiliensis and Noronhomys possess evenly curved enamel bands on the lower incisors, in contrast to the angularization that characterizes those of H. sciureus. Description of this subtle enamel variation and delineation of character states would profit from careful scanning electron microscopy and histological examination. The cuspidate molars of Lundomys differ strikingly from those of Noronhomys, in basically the same ways as it does from Holochilus . , and caudal views of the proximal half of the left tibia of Noronhomys vespuccii and Holochilus brasiliensis .

Abbreviations are It, lateral tuberosity; Itf, lateral tibial fossa; mt, medial tuberosity; ptf, posterior tibial fossa; and tc, tibial crest. The moderately hypsodont, planar molars of Noronhomys and Holochilus are generally similar but contrast subtly in formation of certain enamel folds and their corresponding ridges. All preserved Ml and M2s of Noron-A homys have truncated but well-formed mesolophs that contribute to the planar occlusal surface . The short mesolophs, in lateralmost projection like those found in Lundomys, are consistently defined, unlike the B Fig. 15 .

Abbreviations are amf, anteromedian fossettid; ef, entoflexid; efd, entofossettid; mf, metaflexid; pf, posteroflexid; pfd, posterofossettid; and prf, protoflexid. Note the isolation of certain medial folds as enamel islands on the second and third molars of Noronhomys as compared with Holochilus, as well as the lack of an anterolabial cingulum and protoflexid on the third molar of Noronhomys. Lingual and labial folds of the lower molars of Holochilus broadly coalesce with the basal margins of the crown. On the lowers of Noronhomys, the posteroflexid of m2 and entoflexid of m3 are sequestered as enamel pits . Accordingly, the medial borders of the m2 and m3 are not dissected by emergent valleys corresponding to those visible on molars of Holochilus. Incipient isolation of the ml posteroflexus in Noronhomys is also suggested by its relatively shallow indentation along the medial wall. These contrasts hold even on the youngest, least abraded specimens of Noronhomys in our sample, which compare favorably in wear stage to young adult Holochilus. The dissimilarity in closure of the lingual folds may relate to the greater coronal hypsodonty seemingly characteristic of Noronhomys, an impression that we cannot easily quantify, however. The m3 of Noronhomys lacks a cingulum and enamel crease on its anterolabial corner ; however, both features are typically present on m3s of Holochilus and Lundomys, although small and weakly defined on some individuals. Examples of Noronhomys possess stout labial roots on the upper and lower first molars, like those found in Holochilus . Also like Holochilus and Lundomys, a smaller lingual root usually anchors the middle of ml of Noronhomysamong 44 specimens in which the crown base is suitably exposed, a lingual root is present and well developed on 9, present but weakly to moderately defined on 25, and apparently not formed on 10. MORPHOMETRIC ANALYSES The five population samples of Holochilus used in the numerical analyses are geographically scattered but fairly circumscribe the range of craniodental divergence in this widely distributed sigmodontine . Although usage of the nominal epithets H. brasiliensis and H. sciureus conforms to recent classifications of Sigmodontinae , we must emphasize the inadequate comprehension of specific limits among populations of Holochilus, in particular those now grouped under H. sciureus. Although insufficient to clarify the alpha taxonomy of Holochilus,3 the coarse sampling design does furnish an adequate backdrop to interpret variational patterns within our sample of N. vespuccii and to gauge its level of differentiation from continental forms. The fossil sample, given the disassociation of skeletal parts and their usually broken condition, constrained the analytical design and scope of multivariate analyses performed. Consequently, the following morphometric comparisons with living species were computed separately for mensural data obtained from crania, mandibles, and femora. SAMPLE VARIATION AND UNIVARIATE STA-TISTICS: Of the skeletal elements recovered for Noronhomys, only the mandibles, in view of their abundance, offer a suitable sample to assess population variation and homogeneity. Among the 15 measurements obtained from the mandible and its dentition, two subsets of highly intercorrelated variables are apparent-those representing the molars, which once erupted do not change in size, and those representing the dentary bone, which exhibits some age-related increase in size. Molar a Due to the variable preservation of recovered dentaries, not all measurements could be recorded for all specimens. * P -0.05; ** P -0.01; *** P < 0.001. dimensions are, in general, positively and strongly correlated ; correlation values of length and width measurements of an individual tooth typically surpass those recorded between different teeth. The other consistent association involves dimensions measured on the mandible and lower incisor , most of which also correlate positively with one another . The height of the ml, which incidentally decreases with advancing age, is inversely associated with this dentary subset, and significantly so except for length of the masseteric crest. Although correlation coef-ficients tend to be large and positive among variables within each subset, they are smaller, commonly negative, and usually insignificant between the two. The same two suites of intercorrelated mandibular variables also characterize the series of H. sciureus from Bolivia , although coefficients tend to be smaller than those computed for the larger sample of Noronhomys . Coefficients of variation impart a similar contrast among variables recorded from the mandible and lower dentition. Values of sample variation are typically small for all molar dimensions of Noronhomys , whereas they are considerably larger for those dimensions measured on the dentary and its incisor . Moreover, the magnitudes and patterns of measurement variability closely parallel that observed in population samples of H. brasiliensis and H. sciureus; these exhibit comparably small coefficients for molar size, intermediate values for incisor and mandibular dimensions, and greatest variation for the contingently age-related crown height . That postweaning growth, or lack thereof, explains some of the covariation among these measurements is suggested by sample means and analyses of variance derived from qualitatively defined tooth wear classes, which roughly approximate relative age of specimens. The dentary and lower incisor of Noronhomys exhibit relatively large, incremental increases in mean size from young to old-adult age classes; however, mean dimensions of the molar teeth vary little and erratically with respect to age. Correspondingly, f-values for age-related effects are much greater and significant for the incisive and mandibular measurements but small and negligible for all molar dimensions . Again, metaconid height of the first lower molar is inversely related to age, as indexed by tooth wear class, a factor which logically accounts for most of its extensive variation. Univariate ranges, correlation coefficients, and measures of dispersion among mandibular and lower molar dimensions of Noronhomys are unremarkable in comparison with those derived from population samples of extant Holochilus. Further, the intensity, direction, and pattern of these numerical associations conform to those reported for other muroid species, particularly in regard to age-related size increase of the mandible and incisor and to age-invariance of fully erupted molars , such divergence is minor relative to that attributed to age and geographic effects within sigmodontine species and wholly negligible compared with taxonomic differences between them . Lundomys and Holochilus are consistent with our current understanding of their generic and specific classification . The skull of the holotype of N. vespuccii stands apart from the samples of both Lundomys and Holochilus. The extremal position of Noronhomys on canonical variate II reflects certain breadth measurements and the long basicranium and toothrow relative to size of skull . On canonical variate III, the relatively short zygomatic plate , small ectotympanic bulla , and narrower molars similarly influence the high score of Noronhomys on this factor. Based upon log-transformed means of OTUs, the first two principal components extracted summarize most intersample variation . The large, positive correlations of most dimensions with the first component implicate general size as a primary explanation for the array of OTU scores . Along this component, the type specimen of N. vespuccii compares favorably with a large example of H. sciureus, a numerical finding which corroborates one's visual impression when laying out skulls for comparison. As in the canonical variate scatter plots, proportional contrasts in three variables largely account for the segregation of Noronhomys from examples of Lundomys and Holochilus on the second principal component . Several of the mensural variables that contribute to the consistent morphometric separation of Noronhomys lend objectivity to qualitative differences noted in the anatomical comparisons. For example, the narrower constriction of the interorbit and broader zygomatic plates of Holochilus and Lundomys agree with the patterns of variable loading uncovered and their influence on the ordinal segregation of Noronhomys, whether seen in discriminant function or principal component analysis . However, the large effect divulged for postpalatal length was unexpected with regard to the divergence of Noronhomys. The comparatively greater postpalatal length, and by extrapolation the basicranial segment this linear dimension spans, conceivably relates to the flat cranial profile characteristic of Noronhomys and certainly correlates inversely with the shortness of its hard palate. In summary, while we acknowledge the minimal sample size of one intact skull, the covariation patterns among the 15 craniodental variables depict the fossil form as something other than an insular variant of either Holochilus or Lundomys. In view of the ample number of mandibles recovered for Noronhomys, small sample size cannot be advanced to qualify interpretation of multivariate analyses based on measurements of the dentary and lower dentition. Thirty-eight of the 64 mandibles analyzed possess complete molar rows, and 18 of those are sufficiently intact to permit measurement of all 15 variables defined for the lower jaw. Compared with the topographically complex, three-dimensional conformation of the rodent cranium, a lower discriminatory potential might be anticipated for linear variables obtained from the flat, basically two-dimensional dentary. Nevertheless, principal component analysis of these dimensions, as extracted from the correlation matrix, still conveys the singular morphology of Noronhomys , Lundomys, and Noronhomys .

See Materials and Methods for explanation of OTUs. NO. 3256 Discriminant Function Analysis and One-Way ANOVAs Based on Craniodental Variables . Most variables, but especially molar lengths and widths, contribute strongly to variance of the first principal component, an association that is consistent with the separation of the two largest species, L. molitor and H. brasiliensis, from all others on this axis. No discrimination among taxa is apparent along the second component, which atypically emerged as an age factor as indicated by the large positive coefficient for crown height of ml and by the strong negative correlations disclosed for incisor girth and mandibular depth . The third factor extracted suggests the distinctiveness of examples of Noronhomys from those of Holochilus and Lundomys, an isolation influenced by certain molar dimensions, the narrow width of the incisor, and the long masseteric crest. The somewhat disharmonious combination of these variable covariations portrays Noronhomys as a rodent having a robust mandible, a long toothrow consisting of rel- atively narrow molars, and decidedly thin yet deep incisors. This shape syndrome contrasts with that observed in members of Holochilus, which also possess a robust dentary and long toothrow but have wider molars and notably broader lower incisors . We necessarily limited morphometric analyses of the hind limb to the femur because of its greater occurrence as an intact bone within Noronhomys material. Discriminant function analysis, using log-transformed values of the 13 femoral measurements, consistently isolated Noronhomys from the three living taxa on the second canonical variate extracted . Dimensions that influence the Noronhomys separation include those that reflect the greater girth of its femoral shaft , its stout neck and articular ball , and the area of the patellar fossa . All hind-limb variables are significantly and positively associated with the first canonical variate , which predictably sorts the specimens from smallest to largest ; on this -0.5 -0.4 -0.3 -0.2 -0.1 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 PC 1 Fig. 18 . Projection of sample scores on first two principal components extracted from analysis of log-transformed means of 15 craniodental variables representing six OTUs of Holochilus , Lundomys, and Noronhomys . axis, examples of Noronhomys are inseparable from those of H. brasiliensis. These results underscore the long, slim appearance of the femora possessed by Holochilus and Lundomys relative to the stocky conformation characteristic of Noronhomys . In order to better grasp shape differences with respect to age influences and possible allometric effects, ordination of the femoral data was repeated for the three largest species , and individual scores were plotted against actual femur length . Variable coefficients for the first principal component extracted from the covariance matrix again reveal the large positive correlation of this axis of variation with most measurements. For a long limb bone like the femur, much of its variation in greatest length plausibly represents growthrelated age differences, expressed as simultaneous increases in the girth of its shaft, the size of its articular condyles, and the size of processes for muscle attachment . Taxonomic separation is more clearly evident in the dispersion of scores along the second component, which instead suggests certain proportional contrasts in development of the distal articular condyles and associated patellar fossa and in thickness of the neck . In assessing the phylogenetic relationships of Noronhomys, we a priori accept the monophyly of the tribe Oryzomyini and its generic contents as recently argued by Voss and Carleton . This hypothesis has been generally borne out by subsequent cladistic studies surveying more sigmodontine taxa and additional morphological characters and by studies based on other kinds of data, such as karyology and DNA se- .

See Materials and Methods for explanation of OTUs. quencing . These tribal limits thus exclude the short palate, pentalophodont thomasomyines, contra Reig , but accord closely with the narrower definition of oryzomyines as first outlined by Thomas . However, membership of Oryzomyini sensu stricto does embrace certain tetralophodont genera that were formerly allocated to other tribes. Voss , Voss and Carleton , and Steppan review the taxonomic history of the Oryzomyini and discuss the morphological evidence for these generic reassociations. Diagnosis of Noronhomys necessarily required comparisons with Holochilus and Lundomys, but other oryzomyine genera were examined to provide a broader phylogenetic context. Prior studies have implicated a close kinship among Holochilus, Pseudoryzomys, and Zygodontomys , genera that also need to be considered in illuminating the relationships of Noronhomys. In addition, we included Oryzomys palustris, the type species of the genus, 0. subflavus, a South American relative of 0. palustris, and Microryzomys, a genus which is endemic to Andean wet montane forests and which possesses many plesiomorphic traits within the Oryzomyini . In total, 40 ordered characters, most restricted to cranial and dental features for comparability with available material of the extinct Noronhomys, are described below for nine species of Oryzomyini and a hypothetical sigmodontine ancestor . Char-33 1999 acter definitions and rationale for the polarities adopted draw upon a now substantive body of phylogenetic investigations on neotropical muroid rodents-for example, Hershkovitz , Carleton , Voss , Braun , and Steppan . In their study of Lundomys and Holochilus, Voss and Carleton elaborated upon and figured many of the characters listed below, so their polarity arguments are not repeated here. Remarks are given where our character-state treatment contradicts or clarifies aspects of the ongoing dialogue about muroid character analysis. The alphabetic order of states within most characters represents the hypothesized linear sequence of primitive to derived changes; the ancestral state of several characters is acknowledged as unknown and the condition of the five external variables for Noronhomys as missing. Character 1. Development of zygomatic plate and notch: plate narrow, notch indistinct; plate broader with moderately deep notch, anterodorsal margin smoothly rounded, without a sharp corner or spinous process; plate broad and notch conspicuous, anterodorsal margin produced as a sharp corner or spinous process. Character 2. Posterior margin of zygomatic plate: situated noticeably anterior to the alveolus of Ml, as observed in ventral view; approximately even with the alveolus of Ml. Remarks: Among the oryzomyines included, a more rostral placement of the zygomatic plate, as judged by the position of its rear edge relative to the molar row, is the usual condition . Steppan provisionally interpreted the relatively forward orientation as plesiomorphic in view of its slightly broader occurrence among his outgroup taxa; on the other hand, some paleontologists have considered the posterior disposition of the zygomatic plate in certain Miocene cricetids as ancestral to later forms that have the zygomatic plate produced forward. The state of this character in the hypothetical outgroup is recorded as unknown. Character 3. Size of jugal: small but consistently formed, zygomatic processes of maxillary and squamosal never in contact; tiny and irregularly formed, zygomatic processes of maxillary and squamosal typically in contact. Character 4. Interorbital shape and supraorbital ridging: hourglass shaped over midsection , supraorbital edges rounded in cross section, temporal ridging absent even in oldest adults; hourglass shaped over midsection, supraorbital edges squared, temporal ridging weakly pronounced except in old adults; hourglass shaped over midsection, supraorbital edges squared, slight shelf at postorbital margins with dorsally projecting bead, temporal ridging strongly expressed except in young animals; strongly convergent at midsection , supraorbital ledges pronounced with dorsolaterally projecting ridge, temporal .

Polygons enclose maximal dispersion of individual specimen scores around a group's centroid. ridging strongly expressed except in young animals . Remarks: Throughout the superfamily, the interorbital region of the muroid skull exhibits various and complex modifications that have spawned their own special terminology and comparative context. The shape of the interorbit and the elaboration of its dorsal rim figured prominently in the early alpha-level taxonomy of muroids and logically acquired significance as cladistic characters in estimates of higher-level systematic relationships. In recent attempts at phylogenetic reconstruction, some investigators have represented this variation as a single complex character , whereas others have separately emphasized features of interorbital shape from those of supraorbital ornamentation . The two aspects of interorbital configuration, as well as their relation to temporal ridging, are so strongly interrelated that the former treatment is adopted here: modifications of the supraorbital rim are coded as independently derived from state b. For the cladograms produced, the different coding approaches are inconsequential with regard to tree length or structure. Discriminant Function Analysis and One-Way ANOVAs Based on Femoral Variables present, concealing frontal-squamosal suture in adult specimens. Character 6. Breadth of interparietal: broad, strap shaped, nearly as wide as caudal border of parietals; narrow, wedge shaped, about half as wide as caudal border of parietals. Character 7. Extent of incisive foramina: short, not extending posteriorly to or between molar alveoli except in juvenile specimens; long, extending to or between molar alveoli in all or most adult specimens. Remarks: The ancestral state was treated as unknown in the hypothetical ancestor. Character 8. Configuration of palatal bridge: relatively broad and flat; narrower and moderately corrugated; narrower anteriorly, deeply furrowed with median ridge and occasionally with palatal excrescences formed at posterior end. Character 9. Posterior extent of bony palate: terminates noticeably short of posterior margin of M3s; extends even with or slightly behind M3s; extends conspicuously beyond M3s. Remarks: The development of the bony palate, particularly its production caudad beyond the molar rows, is a trait that was advanced first by Thomas . Whereas most thomasomyines do possess an unambiguously short palate , a long palate, although typical, is by no means ubiquitous within Oryzomyini. Among the taxa we consider, the bony palate terminates only slightly beyond or nearly even with the end of the third molars in examples of Microryzomys, Holochilus, and 0. subflavus; the palate is by operational definition \"short\" in specimens of Noronhomys. Character 10. Development of posterolateral palatal pits: usually a single nutrient foramen at posterolateral margin of bony palate; multiple foramina occurring at posterolateral margin, often recessed within oval pit; Fig. 21 . Plots of femur length against the first two principal components extracted from analysis of 12 log-transformed femoral variables measured on 19 intact specimens representing Holochilus brasiliensis, Lundomys, and Noronhomys . multiple foramina present in similar position but not set within oval pit. Remarks: Pronounced palatal pits characterize most oryzomyine species in our study. In Noronhomys, clearly circumscribed pits are lacking, but seemingly homologous foramina, as judged by their anatomical location, perforate the anterolateral wall of the mesopterygoid fossa; this character is conceivably associated with the unusually short Morphological Character States for Nine Oryzomyine Species Character bony palate of this taxon. Whether entered as an ordered or unordered character type in PAUP, the lack of well-defined pits was parsimoniously depicted as a character reversal on the branch leading to Noronhomys. Character 11. Conformation of the parapterygoid fossae: fossae relatively broad , approximately level with plane of the bony palate; fossae narrower , moderately excavated above bony palate; fossae narrow and short, cavernous, with anterior margins undercut. Character 12. Size of ectotympanic bullae: relatively small, exposed flange of periotic bone extends to internal carotid canal; intermediate, exposed portion of periotic bone smaller and not contributing to wall of carotid canal; relatively large, periotic bone mostly masked in ventral view. Character 13. Alisphenoid strut: present, buccinator-masticatory and accessory oval foramina separate; absent, buccinator-masticatory and accessory oval foramina confluent. Remarks: The consensus of outgroup comparisons conducted for phylogenetic studies of Muroidea has favored the presence of an alisphenoid strut as primitive . Steppan viewed the possession of a well-formed alisphenoid strut as derived for certain phyllotine species. Although many muroids, including most oryzomyine taxa, uniformly lack the strut, its presence varies within species of Oligoryzomys , Pseudoryzomys , Oecomys, and the Oryzomys nitidus complex . Such population-level polymorphisms lend plausibility to the independent fixation of this trait as present or absent in various descendent lineages. Character 14. Cranial foramina and carotid circulation: stapedial and sphenofrontal foramina present, vascular groove crosses the inner surface of the squamosal and alisphenoid bones, posterior opening to alisphenoid canal large ; sphenofrontal foramen and internal vascular groove absent, stapedial foramen absent or minute, posterior opening to alisphenoid canal irregularly formed or occluded . Character 15. Configuration of masseteric ridges: superior and inferior masseteric ridges converge anteriorly as an open chevron; anterior portion of ridges variably conjoined as single crest that extends nearly to the mental foramen. Character 16. Conformation of mandibular ramus: shallow, leading edge of ascending ramus oriented more obliquely, coronoid process placed lower than condyloid process, posterior margin of angular process about equal to that of condyloid process; deep, leading edge of ascending ramus oriented more vertically, coronoid process arches level with or above the condyloid process, angular process produced behind the condyloid process. Character 17. Enamel facets on incisors: upper and lower incisors smoothly rounded or flattened, without labial bevel; upper incisors somewhat flattened medially, with presumptive labial bevel, lowers unmodified; upper incisors flattened laterally, with distinct labial bevel, lowers flattened laterally with lingual bevel. Character 18. Molar coronal topography: brachyodont, cusps tuberculate with lingual and labial rows crested; higher crowned, cusps bunodont with lingual and labial rows unevenly terraced; moderately hypsodont, occlusal surface planar. Character 19. Molar occlusal design: cusps essentially opposite with rounded outer margins , lingual and labial folds not interpenetrating; cusps slightly alternating with rounded outer margins, some lingual and labial folds moderately interpenetrating; cusps conspicuously alternate with acute outer margins , some lingual and labial folds deeply interpenetrating. Character 20. Development of Ml procingulum: anteromedian flexus clearly inscribed on younger specimens, anterocone bilobate as lingual and labial conules; anteromedian flexus absent, anterocone broader with separate conules variably evident on only unworn teeth; anterocone wide, lacking any suggestion of a flexus or constituent conules. Remarks: Reconstructing the homology of enamel structures and contiguous hollows that attended the elaboration of the wide, entire procingula found in the upper and lower first molars of Holochilus poses uncertainties. For the Mls, the above transformation hypothesis acknowledges the coalescence of formerly independent lingual and labial conules and sequestration of the remnant flexus as an internal depression, as was interpreted for 0. palustris . Such a modification is suggested by the occasional presence in some juvenile Oryzomys and Pseudoryzomys of bilobate anterocones, a condition that is coded as an intermediate character state. On such specimens, a medial enamel border segregates the dentinal cores of the apparently conjoined lingual and labial conules. See Reig , Voss , and Steppan for further discussion and cladistic treatment of the procingulum complex in other sigmodontine rodents. Character 21. Mesolophs on Ml and M2: mesolophs present and long, typically extending from median mure to labial cingulum; mesolophs present and short, not reaching the labial cingulum; mesolophs absent or minimally suggested in unworn molars as an enamel deflection of the median mure. Character 22. Mesoloph on M3: usually present and well developed; absent or vestigial. Character 23. Anteroloph on Ml: present and well developed, extending to labial cingulum; present and short, not extending to cingulum; absent. Character 24. Posteroloph on Ml and M2: present, moderately long and persisting until later wear stages; present, short and disappearing after little to moderate wear; absent. Character 25. Protoflexus of M2: present as a shallow indentation, at least in unworn dentitions; absent. Character 26. Development of procingulum on ml: anteromedian flexid present, defining anterolabial and anterolingual conulids and communicating with anteromedian fossettid; anteromedian flexid absent, anteroconid a single wider cusp, and anteromedian fossettid, anterolophid, and protolophid variously defined; anteroconid broad, enclosing an internal enamel pit, other procingular elements indiscernable. Remarks: Like its occlusal counterpart on the upper first molar , the formation of the ml procingulum, particularly the derivation of the so-called internal enameled pit of certain oryzomyines , remains obscure. The morphology of the enamel pit appears similar among the genera Pseudoryzomys, Holochilus, Lundomys, and Noronhomys. This procingular basin may represent a phylogenetic remnant of the anteromedian fold that became enclosed: anteriorly by fusion and broadening of the lingual and labial conulids along their forward rim; and posteriorly by retention and hypertrophy of the medial segments of the anterolophid, protolophid, and possibly the contiguous portion of the murid. All of these elements are irregularly defined in species of Oryzomys, in which the size of an ml pit is neither so large nor its boundaries, especially at the posterior border, so completely formed. This procingular condition is coded as intermediate to those observed in Microryzomys and the four genera mentioned above. Character 27. Mesolophids on lower molars: consistently present and well-developed, extending to lingual cingulum; present and short, not meeting the lingual cingulum; clearly defined as a discrete entity from the hypoconid; boundaries of the posterolophid and hypoconid indistinct, the two continuous as a broad loph across the rear margin of the tooth. Character 29. Protoflexid of m3: present, short anterolabial cingulum well defined, at least in unworn teeth; absent, anterolabial margin of m3 smoothly rounded. Character 30. Posteroflexid of m3: present; absent. Remarks: The posteroflexid in examples of Z. brevicauda is observable in only very young specimens with scant wear on the m3; those of Z. brunneus possess a larger fold that generally persists until later wear stages . The obliteration of the posteroflexid, together with other coronal rearrangements-loss of the mesolophid, suppression of the entoconid, and coalescence of the hypoconid-posterolophid-yield the \"s-shaped\" third molar central to Hershkovitz's classical definition of the sigmodont group. Character 31. Lingual folds on m2 and m3: m2 posteroflexid and m3 entoflexid open to lingual margin of tooth; lingual folds isolated as enamel islands on m2 and m3 , respectively. Character 32. Labial root of Ml: absent; present. Character 33. Accessory roots of ml: absent, ml with two roots; labial accessory root present, lingual root smaller and variable, three or four roots total; labial and lingual accessory roots present and typically well developed, four roots total. Character 34. Relative size of M3: longer than second molars, principal coronal features of posterior half of third molars recognizable; distinctly shorter than second molars, posterior half noticeably reduced and serial enamel homologies obscured or distorted. Character 35. Relative size of m3: shorter than second molars, reduction principally evident in posterior half such that serial enamel homologies may be obscured; subequal in size to second molars, principal coronal features of posterior half of third molars recognizable; longer than second molars. Remarks: The character state for both upper and lower third molars was recorded as unknown in the composite ancestor. Within Muroidea, the contribution of the last-erupted molars to overall toothrow length and occlusal area is not necessarily positively correlated in the upper and lower dentitions of the same species. Commonly, the M3 is noticeably smaller relative to M2, its occlusal details distorted, while the m3 approximates the size of the m2, its enamel landmarks clearly discernable. Systematists have rendered differing polarity interpretations for departures from this prevalent plan . Character 36. Ungual tufts on hind foot: present; absent. Character 37. Natatory fringe on hind foot: absent; present. Character 38. Plantar pads on hind foot: pads large and fleshy, interdigitals 1-4 set close together, hypothenar conspicuous; pads smaller, interdigitals 1 and 4 displaced proximally relative to 2 and 3, hypothenar present but small; pads distributed as in state but tiny and of low relief, hypothenar pad absent or minute. Character 39. Interdigital webbing on hind foot: absent; present but small, not extending to first interphalangeal joint of any digits; present and large, extending to or beyond first interphalangeal joints of digits II, III, and IV. Character 40. Conformation of hind feet: digits 11-IV slightly longer than I and 41 1999 Noronhomys vespuccii Fig. 22 . Hypothesis of relationship among nine oryzomyine taxa based on 35 craniodental characters . Derived character-state changes are portrayed according to delayed transformation optimization of intermediate taxonomic units. V; nail of digit V extends to terminal phalanx of digit IV; digits II-IV conspicuously longer than I and V; nail of digit V extends to second phalanx of digit IV. Phylogenetic reconstructions based on PAUP were conducted first for the 35 craniodental characters and then for the entire data set, including the 5 external traits. The minimum number of changes represented by the craniodental data , absent any homoplastic conversions, is 54 steps. However, for the ancestral states and polarity sequences argued above, maximum parsimony yielded just one shortest tree of 77 steps . Elimination of three unique states and one cladistically uninformative character reduced the tree length to 73 steps . The same cladistic topology among the terminal taxa was preserved in additional par-simony analyses, whether treating all multistate characters as unordered or designating extant Microryzomys as the default outgroup , although tree lengths and hypothesized character state changes perforce differed slightly . Noronhomys vespuccii is hypothesized to share closest common ancestry with species of Holochilus, a relationship sustained by 18 apomorphic changes. Of these, 10 characterstate transitions are unique and unreversed, including some traits of the cranium and many of the dentition . The branch leading to Noronhomys contains seven derived states, only three of them-autapomorphies; the seven involve loss or occlusion of minor enamel features , shortening of the bony palate and the possibly correlated reduction of palatal pits , and formation of the zygomatic plate . Under the accelerated transformation option of PAUP, the length of the stem uniting the two species of Hclochilus is correspondingly shortened and two additional reversals contribute to the branch of Noronhomys-a flatter palatal bridge and diminution of the auditory bulla . The remainder of our tree conforms to the cladograms generated by Voss and Carleton and Steppan for those taxa common to all three studies. Areas of agreement include the earlier differentiation of Oryzomys sensu stricto and the monophyletic grouping of Pseudoryzomys, Lundomys, and Holochilus. For the characters defined here, the recognition of the last three genera as a clade results from unique changes in supraorbital design and the ml procingulum and from homoplastic transformations that involve formation of a zygomatic spine , modification of carotid circulation , and proliferation of accessory roots on ml . The cognate affinity of Zygodontomys and is due mostly to the loss of the anteroloph and mesoloph , enamel structures that characterize the more complex, pentalophodont molars found in Microryzomys and Oryzomys. Finally, the retention of so many primitive states by the Andean genus Microryzomys assures its basalmost origin relative to the other oryzomyine rodents included . Two clades were invariantly recovered in bootstrap iterations for the 35 craniodental transformations defined -one consisting of all taxa that form a sister-group to basal Microryzomys and the other containing Noronhomys and Holochilus. Other moderately to strongly supported internal nodes, as indicated by bootstrapping values and Bremer indices, include the cognate affinity of Pseudoryzomys and and the monophyly of Holochilus. Predictably, the two weaker clades uncovered through bootstrap resampling subtend those taxa for which alternative phylogenies are found in the two next-shortest trees generated . In one tree of 78 steps, Pseudoryzomys, instead of Lundomys, is arranged as the sistergroup to Holochilus and Noronhomys ; in the other, the genus Oryzomys is depicted as paraphyletic, with 0. subflavus and 0. palustris forming successive outgroups to the remaining taxa . The closer kinship between Pseudoryzomys and emphasizes parsimony for derivation of the conjoined masseteric ridge , gain of the labial root on Ml , and losses of the anteroloph and mesolophid ; in this tree , the genus Pseudoryzomys is undifferentiated from the node that subtends it and . In the shortest tree of 77 steps , these changes are reconstructed as parallelisms between Pseudoryzomys and the lineage and as reversals defining the Lundomys branch. The placement of 0. subflavus as a clade apart from 0. palustris stems from parsimonious rearrangements that involve character differences between these species-extent of the hard palate and ml root development . Further, those shared character states in the most parsimonious tree are instead depicted as parallelisms within each species branch. A single shortest tree was again generated when using all 40 characters . Compared with the phylogeny estimated with only the 35 craniodental attributes, tree length is concomitantly longer , yet branching structure is entirely congruent and measures of character homoplasy are nearly alike . In effect, addition of the five external characters for the eight extant taxa bolstered the stems subtending Pseudoryzomys and kin and the clade, resulting in higher bootstrap percentages and Bremer indices . These character-state transitions involve hind-foot adaptions for a semiaquatic lifestyle, including reduction of the ungual tufts , acquisition of stiff fringing hairs , diminution of the plantar pads and loss of the hypothenar , and elaboration of interdigital webbing . Parallel changes of several of these are foreshadowed within the line leading to 0. palustris. Fig. 23 . Support measures for most parsimonious trees of nine oryzomyine species, with Bremer indices indicated above internal stems and bootstrapping percentages below. A, Cladogram obtained from 35 craniodental characters . B, Cladogram obtained from 35 craniodental and 5 external characters. None of the alternative choices of outgroup, character-type assumptions, character sets, or next-shortest trees discussed above disturbs the sister-group stature of Noronhomys and Holochilus. Nor was Noronhomys ever associated with another genus in any partition of greater than 5% frequency generated through bootstrap replicates. The robustness of the inferred relationship is anticipated by the comparatively large number of apomorphies that accrue along their nodal branch . However, one of three trees recovered with 79 steps represented the relationship of H. brasiliensis, H. sciureus, and Noronhomys as an unresolved trichotomy. Of the four characters that defined a monophyletic genus Holochilus in the shortest tree, two are instead represented as parallel changes within each species of Holochilus and two are redistributed as reversals in the line leading to Noronhomys. Notwithstanding the cladistic uncertainty conveyed by this longer tree, the brunt of the character information and parsimony analyses persuasively implicates mainland Holochilus as genealogically closest to the island fossil. Prior to Olson's discovery in 1973, the only recorded historical sighting that conceivably pertains to a native rodent on the island of Fernando de Noronha comes from the account of the Fourth Voyage of Amerigo Vespucci-the Florentine adventurer after whom the New World is named. This reference appears in the Lettera di Amerigo Vespucci delle Isole Nuovamente in Quattro Suoi Viaggi, in which his putative exploits in Fig. 24 .

The branch lengths are proportional to the number of character state-changes along them, but only transformations of the five external characters are portrayed . the New World are recounted as four voyages made between 1497 and 1504 . Addressed to Piero di Soderini, gonfalonier of the Florentine Republic, the Lettera was published in Florence in September 1504 and was being widely reproduced and circulated by 1505. In 1507, a popular Latin translation was included in Martin Waldseemuller's Cosmographiae Introductio, the first work in which the name \"America\" appeared on a map of the newly found lands in the west. Historians and linguistic scholars, however, strongly doubt that Vespucci was directly responsible for the Lettera, and the earlier printed Mundus Novus, or that he sanctioned their dissemination . The Lettera and Mundus Novus were manifestly designed for popular consumption to celebrate the achievements of a Florentine native son, expressly as counterpoint to the transatlantic explorations of Columbus, a Genoese, and were printed during a time of intense patriotic and political rivalries. The two public documents contain many internal contradictions and inconsistencies of chronology and geography, and so contrast with the style and tone of Vespucci's so-called \"familiar letters,\" sent to Lorenzo de Medici, his longtime patron. Historians have accepted the personal correspondences, which originally circulated in only manuscript form, as proof that Vespucci did undertake some voyages to the New World, namely those traditionally numbered as the second and third . With regard to these navigations, one for Spain and one for Portugal , the familiar and public documents retain much general and specific agreement. This complementarity has led historians to suspect that composite accounts were forged by persons unknown, who drew extensively upon information contained in the familiar letters and other Vespuccian manuscripts now lost, and embellished other details of destination and chronology to emulate a Colombian four-act drama. Formisano thus characterized the Mundus Novus and Lettera \"as texts that might best be labelled not pseudo-but rather para-Vespuccian.\" ", "meta": {"ref_id": "AmerigoVespucciandtheratofFernanadodeNoronha"}}

{"text": "In Haveliwala 's approach, a set of topic-specific PageRank vectors is computed only from pages relevant to the query, which are then used to retrieve results for a query on a particular subject. Since the reptiles and amphibians database provides a smaller domain that cannot be easily broken up in more subdomains, the query-sensitive RecordRank module does not use precomputed vectors. Instead, for each query the RecordRank scores are computed at run-time, but only for the retrieved results. We distinguish the two flavours of RecordRank as Global RecordRank, in which database records are ranked by authority regardless of the query, and Local RecordRank, in which database records are ranked after records are retrieved. Analysis of the queries has shown that queries do not usually pertain to information in some of the longer database columns such as special remarks. Hence, when giving each column equal importance a query such as Bufo marinus will return results such as: RMNH 34003 Bufo marinus Lely Range, airstrip, distr. Marowijne, Surinam, 11-05-1975 , 15.50h, on airstrip, near tall forest, 650m,l+d.X.X. Xxxxxxxxx. RMNH 34003 as well as: RMNH 20761 TANK NO Slide 1980 Paleosuchus trigonatus 1 ex. km 110, 19-09-1980, 20.45 h, in swamp, flooded part of forest with many dead trees and low bushes, near jeep trail through tall forest, 100 m. length 1.445 m, skin and carcass to create skeleton. Stomach contents kept separately: crab + Bufo marinus + grit. Observed this specimen already on 16-09-1980 . After analysis of the queries it was clear that a large majority of the queries pertain to the request for information from the genus and species columns and never from the special remarks column in which one might find information on a specimen's stomach contents. Records with matches found in these columns, as well as in the registration number column are thus presented before records with matches found in other columns. In this section, the results of the experiments of the retrieval of records from the reptiles and amphibians database are presented. Only the first 5000 results returned for each query are evaluated using the evaluation script used in the Text REtrieval Conferences 14 Table 8 . Precision, recall and mean average precision scores for baseline and expansion modules each of the tables presented below, the bold face results are significant with respect to the baseline results that the module is compared to. All significance scores are computed at the p=0.05 level using a paired t-test. The ALL query mode denotes a simple keyword search in which only records should be retrieved in which all query terms match. The ANY query mode is another simple query mode in which records should be retrieved in which any of the query terms match. The interpreted query mode is denoted by COMPLEX in the tables. The precision, recall and mean average precision for the interpretation and expansion modules are presented in Table 8 . As the results in Table 8 show, the ALL query mode benefits more than the ANY query mode of the query expansion. This is due to the fact that the ANY query mode already achieves high recall, simply because it retrieves records in which at least one of the query terms match. Separately, the expansion modules perform best . When combined, and thus when they expand both the geographic and the taxonomic queries , the achieved results are mixed. For the ALL query mode, the precision does not deteriorate significantly , but recall does not improve as much as expected, therefore this module is not further investigated. This is probably due to an explosion of expanded terms for each query term and the subsequent retrieval of too many records. The experiments carried out with the query interpretation module are found in the lower part of Table 8 . The precision and mean average precision scores for the interpreted query mode are significantly higher than for the simple query modes. On its own, the COMPLEX query mode improves the mean average precision with 5.83% over the ALL query mode, and with 7.59% for the ANY query mode. Together with the query expansion modules, the COMPLEX query mode helps improve the scores even more, in particular the geographic expansion module. The difference in recall between the unexpanded ALL query mode experiments and the geographically expanded COMPLEX query mode experiments is even more than 50% . Also the ALL query mode benefits from query expansion. In Table 9 the mean average precision scores for the ranking modules are presented. Our assumption that the RecordRank modules would aid performance because the more authoritative records are presented first proved wrong. For the unexpanded queries, the mean average precision improves, but not significantly. For the expanded queries, the RecordRank modules even harm performance. the expert better, but also provide means to visualise search results in ways suitable to the layperson, such as plotting findings on maps and timelines. Our contribution then focused on two systems aimed at improving the accessibility of data in the CRS; the systems are semi-automatic, in the sense that they perform automated steps in the process of data cleaning and data retrieval, with the aim of supporting experts by saving time and finding relevant information faster. The computer-supported data cleaning system presented uses logical rules to detect clear violations of constraints in pairs of dates , in geographical names , and in taxonomic names . The fact that 'hard' domain constraints are used does not constrain the applicability of the system . ", "meta": {"ref_id": "ChangingDiversityinChangingEnvironment.json"}}

{"text": "1 -' -- A ------.....-..... The elongated cervicals with distinct mid-ventral keels, closely appressed rib facets, and low neural spines are conspicuous features of Malerisaurus. The centra are weakly amphicoelous cylinders throughout the series , constricted in the middle, and are firmly fused with the neural arches. No intercentra are present behind the axis . The cervical vertebrae are rather uniform in their morphology. The length of the centrum increases from the axis to the sixth cervical , then decreases again posteriorly. The zygapophyses are very pronounced, extend beyond the faces ofthe centra, and slope inward and downward close to 45°. Both the rib facets are closely set at the anterior end; the parapophysis arises low down on either side of the ventral keel , while the diapophysis overhangs the arch where it joins the centrum. The beginning of the dorsal series can be recognized by the lack of a ventral keel on the centra and the confluence ofthe rib facets. Proceeding backward along the column, the transverse process becomes longer, horizontally directed, and slightly displaced in a posterior direction. The zygapophyses become smaller and extend laterad slightly beyond the centra. The neural spines become taller and are essentially rectangular in side view, angling slightly posterior from the vertical. The average length of a centrum of the mid-dorsal column is 1.6 cm, half th e length of th e average cervical. The sacrum consists of two separate vertebrae bearing strong sacral ribs. The first sacral rib is stout and crescentic in end view; the second one is thin, bladelike , and compressed dorso-ventrally. In the proximal caudals, the neural spines are well developed, and the ribs are fused with the vertebrae and extend laterally. The chevron facets first appear on the third caudal and continue backward. Distally, the centra become more slender and longer, the spines become low and diminish gradually, the zygapophyses reduce in size , and the transverse processes become very weak and then finally disappear. Shoulder Girdle and Forelimb -The scapula is narrow and high. The glenoid is thickened and consists of a pair of articulating facets ; the upper one is semi-circular, the lower one elliptical. Just above the glenoid, a tubercle on the scapula marks the point of insertion of the proximal tendon of the triceps muscle. The coracoid is a curved bone, elongated antero-posteriorly, and has a prominent post-glenoid projection below and behind the glenoid. A small coracoid foramen appears to be present in front of the glenoid. The interclavicle is broad, T-shaped, and the cross bar is slightly notched anteriorly on the ventral surface for the reception of the clavicles on either side. The median bar is flattened dorso-ventrally and gradually ta- pers posteriorly. The clavicles were not found in the collection. The humerus has expanded ends and a narrow shaft linking them. The proximal and distal articular regions are set at about 45°to each other. The proximal head has a convexity for articulation with the glenoid. Antero-ventrally, the delto-pectoral crest curves from the head to bound the large trochanteric fossa. Distally, there is a prominent ectepicondylar groove on the lateral side. The radius is shorter than the humerus. It expands proximally into a triangular head and has a concave facet for articulation with the humerus. The shaft is curved, slender, and bears a ridge on the posterior aspect. The distal end is expanded slightly, oval in outline, and has a convex surface for the radiale. Pelvic Girdle and Hind Limb -The ilium contributes the major portion of the closed acetabulum. The acetabulum is dorso-ventrally elongated and is bordered along the anterior rim by the supra-acetabular buttress. The posterior process of the iliac blade is strongly developed and extends beyond the posterior margin of the ischium. The anterior process is short. The pubis forms the antero-ventral rim of the acetabulum. The anterior border curves laterally as it descends. Posteriorly, it meets the ischium in a straight, thin edge, leaving a gap in between the two bones farther ventrally. Anterior to this contact lies a large obturator foramen. The dorsolateral border of the ischium is slightly convex, rather than concave, in lateral view, and has a pointed, rather than rectangular, posterior end. There is strong disparity in limb proportions; the fore limb is about 70% the length of the hind. The femur is relatively long and slender, and shows a primitive --------..... --1,~ The internal trochanter is very well developed; it extends ventrally below the level of the shaft and forms the anterior margin of the shallow intertrochanteric fossa. Distally, the femur is expanded and divided into two condyles for tibial articulations. The fibula was received in the postero-Iateral comer, where a groove indicates a sliding contact. It was at least partly a weightbearing bone. The tibia is 90% the length ofthe femur. It has a much enlarged, triangular, proximal head , with a weak cnemial crest on the anterior surface. The shaft is long, slender, and bears an oblique ridge that extends from the proximo-lateral to disto-medial extremities. The distal end is slightly expanded and shows a flat surface for the astragalus. Contrary to this situation, a distinct notch is present here in Malerisaurus robinsonae for receiving the astragalus. Chatterjee restored Malerisaurus as a small, gracile, long-necked archosauromorph with facultative bipedal and quadrupedal gait. From the comparisons oflimb proportions and short trunk region, it was concluded that Malerisaurus was capable of running bipedally, when occasion demanded, as effectively as some of the extant lizards such as Basiliscus and Chlamydosaurus. The skeletal and life restorations of Malerisaurus langstoni are shown in Figure 8 . Adult Malerisaurus would be about 1.2 m long from snout to tail tip with an estimated live weight of 10 kg. The Upper Triassic Dockum Formation of Texas is a continental red-bed sequence accumulated in a mosaic of fluvial, lacustrine, and flood plain deposits . The skeletons ofMalerisaurus were found almost articulated, and juvenile Trilophosaurus skeleton was found alongside them. The specimens were recovered from Quarry 2 , Otis Chalk locality of Howard County. Here the dominant lithology is red mudstone intercalated with lenses of fine-grained sandstones and conglomerates. Quarry 1 and Quarry 2 are only 100 meters apart, and the fauna is dominated by well-preserved, mostly terrestrial vertebrates with a few aquatic members . The presence ofnumerous whole or partially articulated skeletons in a 30 ern thick bone bed in these two quarries suggests a quick in situ burial of a Dockum community in consequence of a catastrophic event such as a flash flood . Quarry 1 and Quarry 2 represent two distinct age groups of the Dockum populations. In Quarry I most of the taxa represent adult forms whereas in Quarry 2 juvenile or small -sized animals were dominant. The associated nature of the skeletons indicate that they were not sorted by hydraulic action. This distinct size difference between two quarries may indicate different niches or segregations between young and adult groups, and may suggest seasonal reproduction and gregarious habits . Chatterjee speculated on the mode of life of Malerisaurus in the Triassic environment. Malerisaurus is comparable to modem bipedal lizards in size, proportions, and inferred activities. It was essentially a land-dweller and probably lived most of the time on the margins of rivers, lakes, and ponds. However, it could possibly climb trees or take to the water like the modem basilisk when alarmed. The diet probably consisted of small clams, snails and insects or anything it could swallow whole, as is evident from the dentition. In my previous paper , I discussed in detail the affinities of Malerisaurus with other primitive diapsids and concluded that this genus is closely allied to Protorosaurus, Tanystropheus, Macrocnemus, Prolacerta, and Tanytrachelos to form the suborder Prolacertiformes. Kadimakara , a new Prolacerta-like genus from the early Triassic of Queensland, Australia , should be added to this group. Wild independently came to a similar conclusion on the basis of restudy of Tanystropheus. He grouped Prolacerta, Macrocnemus, Tanystropheus, and Protorosaurus within the suborder Prolacertiformes. However, he considered Prolacertiformes as squamates. Gow , Carroll , and Evans pointed out that neither Prolacerta nor any of its allies are squamates regardless of the configuration of the cheek. The loss of the lower temporal arcade does not necessarily indicate squamate affinity. Clearly this feature evolved independently in many diverse diapsid groups including Prolacerta , Gephyrosaurus , sphenodontids , nothosaurs , and millerettids . The primitive squamate features, such as short cervicals, ossified sternum, and anteriorly fenestrate scapulo-coracoid, are lacking in Prolacertiformes, and consequent- ly this group is considered herein as non-squamate diapsid. It appears that during the Permian and Triassic periods, these small reptiles occupied niches that were subsequently taken by the squamates in the Jurassic and later times. Protorosaurus and Malerisaurus have been placed in the same family, Protorosauridae . At that time, the nature of the cheeks of these two genera was uncertain because of incomplete material, and it was assumed that the lower temporal arcade in both genera was complete. In contrast, the Prolacertidae has an open cheek. On the basis ofnew evidence, I now think that both of my earlier assumptions were wrong. The present study clearly indicates that in Malerisaurus the lower temporal arcade has been breached. This contention is further supported by another line The genus Protorosaurus is one ofthe earliest known fossil reptiles, being first recorded in 1706 from the Permian deposits of Thuringia, Germany. It was studied by many eminent paleontologists including von Meyer, Cuvier, Owen, and Huxley. Seeley described the animal and reconstructed the skull as a diapsid with an open cheek. The systematic position of Protorosaurus has been debated for over a century because the structure of the skull-and especially the structure of the temporal region-has never been satisfactorily described. Recently Dr. Rupert Wild has prepared new material of Protorosaurus and kindly provided me with the following information. \"The skull JVP 6, December 1986 is diapsid with reduced lower temporal bar.

{"text": "They remained positive to this light until the excess\" of drganic waste products in the medium grew so great that all died. The tendency of carbon dioxide to produce positive phototaxis seems to be the only factor in the relationship between he chemical content of the water and phototaxis that is likely to be of importance in the normal movements of Daphnia. Yerkes states that some individuals of Daphnia pulex may be made temporarily weakly negative to light by mechanical stimulation, such as picking them up in a pipette, but with many individuals he failed to obtain this result. I have been unable to produce negative phototaxis by any amount of gentle or rough handling, either by picking the animals up in a pipette or by shaking the dish. Daphnids exposed in the darkroom to weak horizontal light from a 50 watt Edison lamp at 50 cm. distance, with observations taken each hour for 30 hours, gave no evidence of a change in phototaxis corresponding in any way to a daily period. Neither could such a change be detected in daphnids exposed for 24 hours to the same weak light before beginning the series of observations. In no experiment is there found the least evidence for believing in the existence of any sort of a rhythm in phototaxis independent of the direct effect of recurrent external changes. When daphnids which have been kept some time in darkness are suddenly exposed to light of any intensity coming from a horizontal direction there is a tendency for them to go to the bottom of the dish . Conversely, when daphnids which have been exposed to light of any intensity are placed in complete darkness they show a tendency to rise to the top of the dish. A tendency to positive geotaxis is also found on changing from weak light to stronger light , or from moderately •strong light to the light from an electric arc . There is also a tendency of this kind on changing from shade to sunlight . Negative geotaxis is produced by the reverse •change in each of these cases. The tendency to go to the bottom on increase of light intensity cannot be due to a decrease of locomotor activity as it has been shown by Yerkes that the locomotor activity increases with increase of light intensity. Neither can it be due to a change of phototaxis because it takes place when the light comes from a horizontal direction. Further, it can be observed that following a great increase of light intensity many of the animals swim directly downwards with the head pointed toward the bottom of the dish. It seems that we have to do here with a change of some sort in the orientation of the animals to the force of gravity. The tendency to move upward following a decrease of intensity is also well marked and must also be due to a change in the reaction of the animals to gravity. Proof that the reversal of geotaxis by changes in light intensity is independent of phototaxis is given in Experiment 11. Here the daphnids remained at the bottom of the dish when exposed to the light from an arc light, no matter whether the light was falling from the side or at an angle of 45 degrees from above or below. When exposed to weak light following the exposure to the arclight the daphnids showed a strong upward tendency indicating that the effect on geotaxis in this case was undoubtedly due to the light intensity. EQUATION Experiment 12 is presented to show that the vertical distribution remains altered for a long time after reduction of light intensity. March 28, 8.30 A.M., 10 Daphnia pulex from laboratory aquarium at a temperature of 18.5° C. placed in a 29 cm. high jar marked off into five divisions. Exposed to diffuse light of laboratory. Cooled to 13° C. We have shown that in Daphnia pulex increase of light intensity causes a tendency toward positive geotaxis, while decrease of intensity causes a tendency toward negative geotaxis. This tendency seems to be stronger the greater the change in intensity. It seems also that these tendencies are persistent for a considerable length of time. On heating Daphnia pulex in the dark to a temperature of about 25° C. there is a strong tendency for the animals to go to the bottom of the dish . On cooling them to a temperature of about 15° C. there is a tendency for them to go to the surface . The position of these animals kept in the dark was determined by turning on a weak light and taking the observation before the position of the animals could change. The tendency to go down on heating cannot be due to the effect of temperature on the locomQtor activity, because it will be shown in a later section that increase of temperature causes an increase of locomotor activity which would tend to cause the animals to move upwards. Neither can this tendency be due to any effect of light because the tendency is present in the complete absence of light. Seemingly it is due to a change in the orientation of the animals with respect to gravity. We may then suppose that the tendency to move upward on cooling is also due to a change in the relation of the animals to the force of gravity. In horizontal light the same effect of temperature on geotaxis is found . March 19, 8 A.M., 10 Daphnia pulex from 14 hours in darkness placed in a 29 cm. high jar marked off into three divisions. Kept in complete darkness except when making observations. Temperature 21° C. Heated to 26° C. 9.00 2 0 8 9.30 0 0 10 10.00 0 2 8 11.00 0 3 7 12.00 M. 0 1 9 1.00 P.M. 12 7 2.00 1 1 8 3.00 0 1 9 4.00 0 2 8 5.00 0 0 10 6.00 1 1 8 Averages at 21° C: 2.5 3 0 4.5 Averages at 26° C: 0 The normal vertical position of daphnids exposed to horizontal light or to darkness will be determined, first by the geotaxis, which will vary with the light intensity and the temperature; and second, by the rate of locomotor activity, which will also vary with the light intensity and with the temperature. The relations of these factors is very complex, especially in view of the fact that the previous exposure to light and heat must be taken into account. Experiments 13 and 14 show that the tendency to go down on heating and up on cooling is persistent for a number of hours. In general, high temperatures produce in Daphnia pulex a tendency to positive geotaxis, while low temperatures produce a tendency to negative geotaxis. These tendencies persist for at leasta considerable length of time. Oxygen: No definite change in vertical distribution could be observed on changing daphnids from water saturated with oxygen to water from which the oxygen had been driven off by boiling or by the reverse change. Carbon dioxide: Carbon dioxide gas was bubbled for half an hour through a jar of tap water and this was then supposed to contain an extra amount of the chemical in solution. How ever, no change in the vertical distribution could ,be observed on changing daphnids into this water or back into normal tap water. Food: No experiments were conducted on the effect of food as a factor affecting geotaxis, but it is probably not of importance in this respect. Waste: One experiment was performed on the effect of waste materials on geotaxis. A very large number of daphnids were placed together in a tall sealed glass jar in the darkroom with weak horizontal light. The crowding was so great that all the adults had died before the end of 24 hours. During this time no change in geotaxis could be observed so it seems that organic waste products have little effect on geotaxis. In so far as these observations and inferences are conclusive we find that changes in the chemical content of the medium have little effect on the geotaxis of the adults of Daphnia pulex. It could not be determined that mechanical stimulation has any effect on the geotaxis of these daphnids. If such an effect is present it is either very weakly marked or is very temporary and can have little value in determining the vertical movements of the animals. A number of experiments were performed to determine if the geotaxis varies at different times during the day. The method used was to place a number of daphnids in a tall jar marked off into five divisions. The jar was completely filled with water and the top sealed by a glass stopper. In the darkroom the jar of animals was exposed to weak horizontal light. A count was made each hour of the number of individuals in each division of the jar, during a period of 30 hours. No periodicity in vertical distribution could be found, either in daphnids taken from daylight at the beginning of the experiment or in daphnids previ©usly exposed to weak light for a day or more. We may then conclude that there is no diurnal rhythm of geotaxis in this species, except that dependent upon rhythmical change in the external physical factors. Daphnids under natural conditions assume a position in the water with the head pointing upward. When no locomotor movements are being made the drag of the antennae on the water, as the weight of the body pulls the animal down, causes the daphnids to assume this posision. When strokes are made with the antennae the tendency then is to raise the animal vertically through the water. The rate of sinking of adult daphnids 3 to 4 millimeters long with expanded antennae is stated by Birge to be at the rate of 20 to 30 centimeters per minute. Young daphnids 1 millimeter or less in length sink much more slowly at the rate of 5 to 10 centimeters per minute. This slower rate of sinking makes it much easier for the young daphnids to remain near the surface than it is for the adults. It will be seen that it requires a-certain rate of activity to maintain an individual at any certain height in the water. If the locomotor activity increases there will be a tendency for the animal to move to higher levels while a decrease of activity will allow it to sink. Yerkes has shown that an increase of light intensity increases the speed of locomotion in Daphnia pulex. It can easily be observed that on a great increase of light intensity there is a decided increase of activity. The increase of locomotor activity caused by increase of light intensity will have a tendency to cause the daphnids to move upwards, while a decrease of intensity slows down their activity and allows them to sink to lower levels. In studying the effect of temperature on locomotor activity a number of experiments were performed to determine the speed of motion toward a weak light at various temperatures. This method is not very satisfactory because the change in temperature causes changes in the phototaxis as well as in the locomotor activity and it is difficult to separate the effects of the two factors. Further, different individuals give very different and often contradictory results. The number of animals used in the averages is too small to give very great accuracy in conclusions. However, it is thought that some of the relations between temperature and rate of activity are indicated. The method used was to mark off transverse unes 10 centimeters apart on the bottom of a glass dish. In the darkroom a 50 watt Edison lamp was placed 25 centimeters horizontally from each end of the dish. A daphnid was then introduced into the dish and allowed to swim toward one light. As soon as the animal passed the line marked off on that end of the dish this light was turned off and at the same time the light at the other end of the dish turned on. An observation consisted of 8 trips, 4 each way, of the animal across the dish. The time was recorded in minutes and seconds. In comparing the effects of change of temperature two dishes were used with the water kept at the different temperatures. Then the animals were gently shifted from one to the other by a large pipette. In Experiment 16 each individual shows a decided increase of speed of travel toward a weak light on first raising the temperature 5 degrees. The averages for five individuals are 4' 02\" at normal temperature and 2' 46\" after heating. Also, the averages of all the observations show a higher rate of speed at the higher temperature. This effect is produced in spite of the fact that the phototaxis is lessened by the increase of temperature. In this case then we have a definite increase of locomotor activity by increase of temperature. 1' 3' 4' 3' 55\" 05\" 00\" 40\" 05\" ?", "meta": {"ref_id": "ContentServer.json"}}

I.AXONOMIC NOTES. A~O~O M Z~/ L~S crocidume is more similar to A topomelzw talpae Fain, Lulzosclius and Cauwenberge, 1973 than to tlie species I<nown frorn Erinaceidae. In males of these two species, the postscapular shield is without ornamentation, the opisthonotal surface posterior to the hysteronotal shield is unornamented, the opistliosonial venter is sparsely covered by scales laterally, trochanter IV laclzs a dorsal spur, and its ventral spur is bil~urcate; in females, tlie hysteronotum is covered by numerous scales, which are longer than wide, tlie genital papillar I-ernnants are separated, and the distal part of the sperliiatheca is not inflated. These species differ from each other by the following characters. In botli sexes ofA. crocidurue, seta la is absent on all tarsi, setaJ'of tarsus 11 is filiform; in males, tlie hysteronotal shield is trapezoidal in shape, with a pair of rounded unsclerotized patches near the bases of setae d2, setae e2 are microsetae, setae ps2 are absent, fe~iiur-genu IV has two ventral spurs, the ventral spur of trochanter IV has two points unequal in length, tarsus IV has two unequal apical points; in females, the postscapular shield is rectangular, with a deep and wide posterior median incision; it is covered by a scale-like pattern, sctac 40 are situated 011 the fused sclei-otized areas of coxae IV, they are subequal in length to sctae g. I11 botli sexes of A. talpae, seta la is present on tarsi I and 11, setaf'of tarsus 11 is inflated; in males, the liysteronotal shield is mushroom-shaped, without the discernible non sclerotized patches, setae e2 are macrosetae, subequal in length to e l , setae ps2 are present, femur-genu 1V is without any spurs, tlie ventral spur of tl-ochanter IV has two subequal points, tarsus IV has two subequal apical points; in females, the postscapular shield is triangular, witli a strongly sclerotized ~ncdian band, setae 4u are situated on the soft cuticle between tlie sclerotized areas of coxae IV and are almost 2 times longer than setae g.

Lis11*0pho1*oides lieuneyi sp.11. differs from all other species of the subgenus, except for L. npon~jn sp.n., by the presence in both sexes of sclerotized bands bordering the lateral rnargins of the postscapular shield. Males of this species differ from all other species by the presence of a pair of pregenital sclerites, and by the hypertrophied posterior ends of the supporting sclerite of the aedeagus. This species is closest to L. UpOnZJLS sp.n. and differs by the following characters. In L. henneyi, pregenital sclerites are present, the posterior ends of the aedeagal-supporting sclerite are hypertrophied, and femur IV is about 1.6 times wider than femur 111. In males of L. al~o1,oni)1s, pi-egenital sclerites are absent, the posterior ends of the aedeagal-supporting sclerite are not hypertrophied, and feinur IV is about 2 times wider than femur Ill. Females of these species cannot be unambiguously distinguished from each other. Females of L. uponiys from the type host differ slightly from L. heuneyi by the shape of the hystcronotal shield. In females of L. apo,ol?zys, the width of thc hysteronotal shield at the level of setae e2-e2 is 1.3-1.5 tinles longer than the width of this shield at the level of setae d l -d l .

This species is a specific parasite of the New Philippine endemic, Bullimtis gunzuy Rickart, Meaney and Tabaraiiza, 2002. TAXONOMIC NOTES. This species along with L. 1~izorzicu.s. sp.n., and L. cor.yz~zrarosae sp.n. form a colnplex of closely related species. The most notable differential character of the complex is the presence in its representatives of a well developed apical protrusion on tarsus 1. These three species possess the following combination of characters. In both sexes, the postscapular shield is without ornamentation or with indistinct lines; in males, the hysteronotal shield is without ornaruentation or with indistinct lines in the anterior part, the scales are absent posterior to setae e2, setae h3 are 75-90 long, the anterior ends of an aedeagal-supporting sclerite are fused to each other; in fetilales, the hysteronotal shield is completely covered by a scale-like pattern and folds, the distance el-el is about 1.5-2 times longer than the distance el-posterior tnargin of the hysteronotal shield; coxae 111 are without transverse lines. Among other species of the subgenus, thc species of this complex are similar to L. do~on~rnator Fain 1976 , from murids from Sulawesi and L. I~rtiventl-u Fain, 198 1, from Sundanzjis nzt~elleri from west Malaysia and southeast Borneo. The mites fsom BziAin~us spp. differ from them by the distinct ornamentation of the hystcronotal shield in females, and also differ from L. dominator In both sexes by the strongly developed expansion of genu I and the more elongated idiosoma.

{"text": "This is a count of arcs connecting one element to another. This number is somewhat biased by the number of elements. The \"Average Fan-out factor\" is the average number of elements that can follow another. The value of 7.76 for museum labels means that on average any element can be followed by any 7 different elements. Variability within elements: Dictionary aided classification is usually unavailable in herbaria label data set. In Address problems, the proper name is an open class but the other elements are much more finite. The number of states, cities within a state and roads within a city are finite. In contrast, there are on the order of 1.5 million scientific names. The International Plant Name Index contains many thousands of entries but is far from complete particularly for older names that have been replaced yet appeared on museum labels. There are also variations in spelling because of human error or changes in nomenclatural rules. The list of all Collectors is also exceedingly long and labels do not follow any single authority. The location where a specimen was found is also an open class. It includes descriptions of locations, e.g. \"300 meters NNW of the last rapids on Stanley Falls, Belgium Congo\". The museum domain is much more complex than the address problem as showed above and information extraction accuracy using the previously developed methods are inadequate. In this section we discuss methods we have used to enhance performance by extending the methods used for previous data sets. The goal of the learning phase of machine learning is to use representative examples to develop models that can, when presented with novel input, create proper classification of the input. Our first training data consists 200 digitized OCR records from the Yale Peabody Herbarium with multiple label formats randomly selected from the typed labels which requiring 10,095 element classifications. The HERBIS Learning System is part of the overall HERBIS system. Museums anywhere in the world can create digital images of their specimens on their site. These images can be passed to the Yale Peabody Museum OCR processing unit where the label is detected and converted to a string sequence. This text packet is sent to HLS at UIUC though a web services connection. The text is converted to an XML document with appropriate information labeled and returns them to the end user. Other image handling services such as MorphBank can call the classification programs directly. HLS uses a modified Hidden Markov Model. The HMM algorithm is discussed elsewhere . The HMM induces a probability distribution on sequences of symbols. The HMM model is an order-preserving algorithm. There are three canonical problems associated with HMM could be solved by different algorithms. One of them is useful in information extraction context. Given the output sequence , find the most likely sequence of hidden states that could have generated a given output sequence. In other words, given the word sequence , find the most likely sequences of element ,sp,sa). This problem is solved by the Viterbi algorithm. A Naïve Bayes model is a probability model based on conditional probabilities. The NB model makes predictions based on the probability distribution of features from the training set. The NB algorithm uses the distribution information to calculate the probabilities that a new instance belonging to the classes. The example would then be classified to the highest probability class. For computational efficiency NB assumes that each feature is conditionally independent of every other feature . This \"independent\" assumption greatly simplifies the model but the assumption is far from accurate in many cases. However, the overall classifier works surprisingly well in practice . The NB calculations are imbedded in part of the HMM algorithm. In order to show the HMM performance comparing to others, we also implemented a nonordered algorithm NB as the baseline and then present of series of extension to HMM below. The following example used the training data that was enhanced by including both the original OCR errors in the training set plus examples where the OCR errors were hand corrected. The difference from this correction is small so we only present the difference between HMM and NB on 41 elements that occur more than 20 times in the training set . There is a set of elements in our dataset which we call \"field element identifiers\" . Some elements of some data labels are preceded by a string to identify the information that follows. For example, the term \"Legit\" in the string \"Legit A. H. Curtiss\" or \"No.\" in \"No. 503\" in Figure 1 . In the museum label training data and machine learning output, we mark these with a terminal \"L\", e.g. COL, LOL , HBL . Those label elements usually indicate that there is respectively a CO, LC, HB element following it, except in cases of missing data and alignment errors. Rather than training the HMM algorithm to extract the Darwin Core elements and treat these other elements as NS, we train the algorithms to recognize the field element identifiers as well. Our result shows that those label elements improve the ML overall 4%. Figure 3 presents the detailed performance differences between with label encoding in the schema and without those field element identifiers. It is very difficult to improve the performance the ML without large numbers of training examples . Unfortunately, it is very expensive to get botanists to create these examples because creating the training examples from the raw OCR output is very time consuming. The analysis above indicated that the performance difference between the USPS address and HERBIS collection are mainly attributable to the relative homogeneity in the format of the USPS addresses. There may be thousands of different formats of labels that have evolved over the last couple hundred years and now reside in museum collections. However, each collector has their own preferred format of label. This means that a particular museum will tend to have a relatively finite number of collectors supplying the museum at any one time and therefore will have a finite number of label formats represented in the collection. Further, if many museums are digitizing labels, then eventually, there will be corrected sets of labels for many collectors. It may be possible to develop multiple training modules each of which specializes in a particular collector and therefore label format. This observation leads to the hypotheses that the specialist model will perform better for records by the same author than for a generalized model trained on a random data collection and That fewer training examples will be required to reach a given level of performance using all labels from the same collector than would be required for a mixed collection of collectors. These hypotheses are supported in the results of the experiment below. HLS includes the following Specialist Bootstrapping Architecture . Rather than following the standard machine learning model of creating training data >> generate model >> deploy model, we design a model where multiple museums could use available models to classify their data but as part of their workflow when they correct the machine learning data to put into their own database those examples are added to a new training pool. This pool can be subdivided into sub-collections to construct new specialist models . When the end-user sends a museum image to the server, the server would perform OCR, classify based on collector and then process the document with the appropriate collector or collection model. If a specialized collector module is not contained in the server, the information will be extracted from the label using the generic model based on a random sample of labels . For this strategy to work, it is necessary to be able to categorize labels into subsets prior to the information extraction step so that the highest performance model could be used for extraction. A Naïve Bayes pre-classifier can successfully perform this task. The 200 generic Yale training set includes 15 records from the collector \"A. H. Curtiss\". The 5-fold evaluation of NB classifier trained to differentiate \"Curtiss\" from \"non-Curtiss records\" preformed well, F-Score of 97.5%. Bootstrapping is a process where a small number of examples are used to create a weak learning model. This learning model, while weak is used to process a new set of examples. When a museum staff member corrects the output, it can be added to their database. The new result can help to form a stronger model. There are fewer errors generated by this new model making it easier for the users to correct the model's errors. Museum staff who digitize records need to perform this step for key fields in any case in order to import the records to their database. These corrected examples are fed back into the process again to create an even stronger model. Successive generations of examples improve performance making it easier for the users to generate more examples. A user wishing to create their own specialized model could begin by processing a set of labels from one collector through the generic Yale model. With each iteration the performance of the specialist system would improve but initially the generic model would perform better, with fewer errors per record. At some crossover point, the performance of the specialized model would exceed that of the generic model. In the example below the crossover point is at about 80 examples. In this framework the user only needs to correct machine output for 80 records to create a model that performs as well as a random collection of 200 records. This crossover point is what the algorithm is looking for in Phase 2 step 7 below. Specialist Learning Algorithm --The steps could be described as follows: Phase 1 1. Developers create a \"generic\" model alpha, M 0 . This experiment compares the specialist model and the generic model generated from Yale 200 example collection. The dashed top line in figure 6 is the performance of 200 records independent of iteration. Regular expressions were applied to the 20,000 Yale digitized labels to identify the approximately 100 examples with the collector's name \"A. H. Curtiss\" who is a well-known collector and botanist. HLS was trained on 10 examples and then 5-fold evaluation used to measure the F-Score. This procedure was repeated 10 times, adding 10 new labels on each iteration producing a training set of 20, 30 and so on until a hundred were used in a training set. The results are presented in the solid curved line, \"Specialist Model.\" ", "meta": {"ref_id": "Greenbergetal."}}

{"text": "Among the 121 sentences, part of them were used as the training set for feature extraction and model building, and the remainder were used for evaluation. We applied the Stanford parser for parsing and chunking in the NLP phase. This step was to prepare for the machine learning part. The parsing of context sentences generated candidate features for machine learning, and when combined with features and relation labels we were able to then conduct training to derive a classifier for relations. A decision tree was the algorithm for selecting features and generating patterns for different types of relations. The resultant classifier was then ready for accepting new context for tag pairs and outputting relations. Finally, we examined the methodology by sending new tag pairs to the trained model. We withheld the other context sentences as a testing set, and input the sentences to the NLP processor and classifier accordingly. The classifier returned the relation of each tag pair as an automatic relation extraction result. Since we had the human coded results, we compared them with the machine learning results and evaluated the performance. Our preliminary experiment extracted 2401 unique features from 121 context sentences. We used a ten-fold cross-validation to evaluate the result . The evaluation result of our method displayed in Table 3 shows an 83.72% rate of correct classification / tag relation instances. While the sampling size of tag data and the number of human coded relations could not be as large as we would have liked, this approach appears to be a promising methodology. The introduction of external sources allows for objectively identifying contextual information for context-less tag data and thereby improving the accuracy and reliability of relation extraction. This result also suggests that using external sources for context information can help detect data anomalies in the tag pairs that have a high MI score. We discovered from our experiment that a high MI score did not necessarily mean that Tag X and Tag Y always had direct semantic relations. Some tag pairs did not appear in any sentence in Google search results and no context was found containing the tags. For example, the two tags Tag X = \"all rights reserved\" and Tag Y = \"Canon EOS 350\" had a high MI score, but neither of these two tags appeared together in Google search results; this suggests that no context sentence existed for the two tags. We are unsure at present how the two tags might be related, but it is possible that they are indirectly related. If, for example, they are both related to a third tag in a meaningful way, then they could be related to each other statistically but not semantically. Consequently, the two tags were semantically unrelated and the pair was removed from the tag pair collection to ensure the meaningfulness of tags and their relations. We also discovered that NLP algorithms can provide flexible and powerful features for relation identification. For instance, a syntax level feature can be helpful for identifying the \"is-locatedin\" class in an example pattern such as Tag X , Tag Y , Zip Code or Tag X prep Tag Y , where Tag X could be a city name and Tag Y a state name. The NLP algorithms then can be expanded and explored with more semantic feature types and other machine learning algorithms. Tags are a special type of subject metadata as well as a rich, powerful vocabulary source. Extracting relations between tags is the first step toward automatic subject metadata creation. An important contribution of this study was the introduction of external resources as a solution to the problem of context-less tag data. Through combining NLP and machine learning techniques we developed a set of algorithms and procedures for automatically processing the external resources, using the output to provide more objective, reliable context information for tag relation extraction. The methodology developed in this study can be applied to larger-scale research in the future as well as in research fields beyond tag relation extraction. For example, the processing and categorization of unstructured text can benefit from this methodology, as can automatic construction of an ontology and controlled vocabulary, as well as automatic mapping between tags and controlled vocabularies. The results of our approach are encouraging for tag relation extraction. We plan to improve the classifier by collecting more relation types and human-coded examples for future experiments, and eventually utilize the relations extracted to enhance subject metadata descriptions. Wikipedia defines a Tag as a 'free-text keyword' and Tagging as an 'indexing process for assigning tags to resources'. A Folksonomy is described as a shared collection of tags used on a certain platform. The term folksonomy defines a user-generated and distributed classification system, emerging through bottom-up consensus . Folksonomies became popular on the Web with social software applications such as social bookmarking, photo sharing and weblogs. A number of social tagging sites such as del.icio.us, Flickr , YouTube , CiteULike have become popular. Commonly cited advantages of folksonomies are their flexibility, rapid adaptability, free-forall collaborative customisation and their serendipity . People can in general use any term as a tag without exactly understanding the meaning of the terms they choose. The power of folksonomies stands in the aggregation of tagged information that one is interested in. This improves social serendipity by enabling social connections and by providing social search and navigation . The simplicity and ease of use of tagging however, lead to problems with current folksonomy systems . The problems can be classified in two: • Local variations: Tags have little semantics and many variations. Thus, even if a tagging activity can be considered as the user's cognitive process, the resulting set of tags does not always correctly and consistently represent the user's mental model. • Distributed variations: Most tagging systems have their own specific ways of working with and interpreting the meaning of tags. Thus if we want to aggregate tagging data from different applications or services, it's very difficult to find out the meanings and correlations between a sets of tags. These limitations are due to the lack of a uniform structure and semantic representation found in tagging systems. In this paper, we will compare existing conceptualisations of tagging activities and folksonomies, to assess their merits and thus contribute to future work in this area. Such a conceptualisation, or ontology, is intended to be used in the representation of tagging data in collaborative tagging systems. This paper begins by discussing the reasons why we need Semantic Web technologies for tagging communities. We then briefly overview existing conceptual models for tagging and propose a novel model for folksonomies. We continue by introducing existing tag ontologies and compare them using our conceptual model. Finally, we discuss the results, draw conclusions, and suggest future research areas. There have been a significant number of efforts to add more structure and semantics to conventional tagging systems. Approaches to tagging and folksonomies have been dominated by a focus on the analysis of tag usage patterns , information retrieval and navigation and social network analysis and clustering Brooks et al., 2006) based on tagging data. Golder and Herbermann collected del.icio.us data and analysed the structure and usage patterns of tagging systems. Their work discusses the distinction between collaborative tagging and taxonomies -although collaborative tagging systems have many limitations in terms of semantics and structures, it provides the opportunity to learn from one another through sharing and organising information. Marlow found that for certain users, the number of tags can become stable over time, while for others, it keeps growing. Cattuto et. al observed small world effects by analyzing a network structure of folksonomies from Bibsonomy and del.icio.us. Their work introduced the notions of clustering and characteristic path length to describe the small world effects. According to the study, folksonomies exhibit a small world structure and have a sort of social network. carried out a study to construct community-based semantics based on a tripartite model of actors, concepts, and instances. He emphasises the social context for a representation of ontologies and generates the well-known co-occurrence network of ontology learning as well as a novel semantic network based on community relationships using del.icio.us data. There are a number of debates on the merits of folksonomies when compared to ontologies and other structured vocabulary and classification systems. Despite noted differences between folksonomies and ontologies , Semantic Web technologies can be regarded as a complement to folksonomies. As free-text keywords, tags do not have exact meanings and succumb to linguistic ambiguities and variations including the human error factor. While a user may interpret a tag's semantics through using or reading it, computers cannot automatically understand the meaning, since it is not defined in a machine-readable way . Folksonomy systems do not provide a uniform way to share, exchange, and reuse tagging data among users or communities . With the use of tagging systems in constant increase, these limitations will become evermore critical. As a potential solution, Specia and Motta propose the integration of folksonomies and ontologies to enrich tag semantics. In particular, Gruber and Spivack emphasise the need for folksonomies and ontologies to work together. In general, tag ontologies can contribute in the following three areas: • Knowledge Representation Sophistication: A tag ontology can robustly represent entities and relationships that shape tagging activities. It could make the knowledge structure of tagging data explicit and facilitate the Linked Data of tagging data on the Web. • Facilitation of Knowledge Exchange: Ontologies enable knowledge exchange among different users and applications by providing reusable constructs. Thus, a tag ontology can be shared and used for separate tagging activities on different platforms. • Machine-processable. Ontologies and Semantic Web technologies in general expose human knowledge to machines in order to perform automatic data linking and integration of tagging data. Before providing a detailed comparison, we start by reviewing individual conceptual models of tagging activities that preceded our own. A tagging model needs to distinguish between entities in a tagging activity that need to be represented, and address the relationships that exist between them. After reviewing existing tagging models we discuss whether the proposed models are suitable to represent collaborative tagging activities. We then propose our extended model, which caters for the collaborative aspect of folksonomies. Many researchers Halpin, 2006; Cattuto, 2007 ) suggested a tripartite model of tagging activities. Although different authors interpret the term \"tagging\" differently, we can identify three common entities -users, tags, and resources. They form a triple that represents the Tagging Process: Tagging: ------------------------------------------------- where U is the set of users who participate in a tagging activity, T is the set of available tags and R is the set of resources being tagged. Gruber suggested an extension to model : Tagging: ------------------------ where object, tag, and tagger correspond to R, T, and U in the tripartite model. The source refers to the tag space where the tagger applies the set of tags whereas the positive/negative parameter is an attempt to represent the collaborative filtering of 'bad' tags from spammers. This tagging model has successfully been used for representing the tagging process at a semantic level. In fact, most tag ontologies have a Tagging class, based on Gruber's model, as a core concept. Existing models consider tagging as an activity where an individual user assigns a set of tags to a resource. While they provide effective ways to describe the tagging process, they do not really support collaborative tagging activities. We therefore want to provide a Folksonomy Model to represent this knowledge, where the folksonomy is considered as a collection of instances of the tagging model. Before doing so, we need to clarify the differences between simple and folksonomy-based tagging practices. Folksonomies are not created independently by individuals in isolation, but collectively by people who participate in the collaborative tagging activity. Thus, the folksonomy model has to cover all the collaborative aspects and relationships in addition to the objects associated with tagging activities. A straightforward model for a Folksonomy could be defined as follows: , user group, source, occurrence) ---------------------- where the tag set is the set of all tags being employed, the user group is a set of users who participate in the tagging activity and the source is the location where the folksonomy is utilised . The fourth parameter, occurrence, plays an important role to identify the tags' popularity. Comparing this model to the tagging model , we can identify the following similarities: the resources are not part of the Folksonomy model per se. The Folksonomy is rather applied to the collective tagging process of the resources. The tag and tagger parameters in have been replaced with a collective representation of these entities -tag set and user group. The source is still unique since a folksonomy is a multi-user approach to tagging on a single platform. In our opinion, filtering should not be represented at this level. Alternatively, given we represent multiple tags in this model, the frequencies of individual tags become important. Thus, we include the occurrence as our fifth parameter. Folksonomy: by extending to make the individual tagging activities explicit: Folksonomy: ---------------- where the last parameter reflects the collective tagging processes performed by the users of the folksonomy, where an individual tagging process is represented by: Tagging: ------------------------------------------------------ where object, tag and tagger have the same semantics as those in . Thus, our Folksonomy model now incorporates a representation for the collective tagging processes that are individually defined by the Tagging model . There is no simple criterion for the comparison of tag ontologies. For this reason, we briefly compare the tag ontologies with respect to their suitability for: • representing tagging activities and tagging data • representing features of folksonomies We will compare seven conceptualisations, keeping in mind the folksonomy model we proposed in Section 3.2. In particular, we include in our comparison a conceptualisation that we presented in our earlier work -the SCOT Ontology . The choice of the conceptualisations was based on how concrete the model is for tagging and use by online communities. Although a lot of work in analyzing folksonomies has been done in social theory and information retrieval, very few tag ontologies have been reported until today. Few 132 researchers have explicitly specified conceptualisations of tagging data in a formal language. Concerning our selection, at the time of this research only 6 of the 7 conceptualisations were actually proposed as ontologies and described in a dedicated representation language . Although Gruber's model is just defined conceptually, we include it in our comparison since many research papers have cited his model and some ontologies have been developed based on this model. The selection of ontologies we include in our comparison is shown in Table 1 . Some of the selected conceptualisations better suit the first criterion we have defined at the beginning of this section , whereas others are better suited to the second criterion . However, all conceptualisations are suitable for both criterions to varying degrees. We will now have a brief look at them individually. Gruber's work is an early attempt to conceptualise tagging activities. His model can be viewed as a first step towards a general applicable representation model for tagging. Although his model itself is not an ontology it clearly reveals a generic conceptualisation of tagging. For more details on his work we refer to Gruber describes relationships between an agent, an arbitrary resource, and one or more tags. In this model there are three core concepts such as Tagger, Tagging, and Tag to represent a tagging activity. Knerr provides the tagging concept in the Tagging Ontology and Echarte et. al propose a model for folksonomies . Since their approaches are based on the ideas of Gruber and Newman, the core elements of the ontologies are almost identical. In particular, Echarte's model extends concepts such as time, domain, visibility, type, etc., and is represented by OWL. The SCOT Ontology -Social semantic Cloud of Tags, describes the structure and semantics of tagging data and enables interoperability of tagging data among heterogeneous social websites and tagging applications. Although SCOT's main goal is to represent collaborative tagging activities, it is also suitable for representing the features of folksonomies . MOAT -Meaning of a Tag, is intended for semantic-annotation of content by providing a meaning for free-text tagging. In addition to extensions to the Tag, Tagging, and Tagger concepts from Newman's ontology, MOAT provides the Meaning class to represent custom, user-provided 'meanings' for tags. The Nepomuk Annotation Ontology is provided for annotating resources on the Social Semantic Desktop . It is not entirely dedicated to tagging practices but demonstrates the increasing importance of tagging representation in social systems. Table 1 , given the criteria discussed at the start of this section. Whereas Newman's Ontology is more inclined towards representing tagging data, and Echarte's Ontology towards representing features of folksnomies, SCOT has a higher level of sophistication in both directions. In the next section, we will detail the main entities and features that the six ontologies and Gruber's model are able to represent. We will support our conclusions in this section by exploring the suitability of the individual conceptualisations, vis-à-vis criteria and as set out in the start of this section. We start by listing and comparing the concepts and proceed by listing and comparing their features . In this section we discuss in more details the general comparison we presented in the previous section. First, we will have a look whether the individual conceptualisations are suitable for representing general tagging activities and tagging data. All models have a representation for the object, tag and tagger in our Tagging model and all except NAO have a concept representing the tagging process. In Newman's model, the tagging concept is further refined into tags:RestrictedTagging and tags:Tagging . Echarte et al. provide the Annotation class to represent the tagging activity -i.e., it is the same as tags:Tagging. Thus, the Tagging concept can be considered as a core concept of tag ontologies. Although SCOT and MOAT have different goals compared to others, they also can describe tagging by linking to the tags:Tagging class in Newman's ontology. We now consider whether the ontologies address collective tagging data and provide sufficient features of folksonomies, as described in our Folksonomy model . Some ontologies which are based on Gruber's model have been extended in order to support folksonomies. For instance, Knerr Source class to represent the source. In addition, Knerr allows a user to use foaf:Group alongside foaf:Person to describe the user group. Similarly, NAO allows the user to use nao:Party to represent the user group. MOAT does not have a class for defining it. Nevertheless they are not enough to represent folksonomies at a semantic level. SCOT is consistent with the folksonomy model and provides representations for the source, user group and tag set. In Table 2 we compare the classes provided by these conceptualisations that are relevant to our study. Additionally, we must note that although an ontology might not provide all the required representations, they can act as a \"good Semantic Web citizen\" by connecting to external vocabularies such as SIOC , FOAF , SKOS , or DC to further weave data on the Web. For example, MOAT and SCOT use the SIOC ontology extensively to describe online communities, while other ontologies do not reuse or link to external terms. In particular, although Echarte has its own classes to represent a tagging and a folksonomy, the classes do not have any relations with other RDF vocabularies. While the number of classes enhances taxonomical representations, the power of ontologies lies in the ability of representing relationships between the classes. Although most of the studied ontologies have a similar taxonomical structure, their attributes vary according to their goals and purposes. We will now have a look at the attributes provided by the ontologies, and compare their functionalities. We differ between data type attributes, which relate classes to non-conceptual data , and object type properties which provide relationships between classes. Data Type. Aside from declarative features that represent relationships among users, tags, and resources, a semantic model for folksonomies needs to provide for descriptive features that state non-conceptual values. Most surveyed tag ontologies have many attributes to describe data-type values, i.e. numerical quantities, free-text descriptions, date, time, etc. The data-type properties relevant to this work are summarised in Table 9 . A number of datatype properties are either directly or indirectly reused from the Dublin Core vocabulary. For instance Newman's ontology tags:name is a subproperty of dc:title and tags:taggedOn is a subproperty of dc:date. Only SCOT provides for the description of numerical values for entities, e.g. scot:totalTags refers to the total number of tags in a tag cloud and scot:totalItems refers to the total number of resources tagged with tags in the tag cloud. SCOT also provides properties relating to the frequency of a tag itself. Whereas the simplistic scot:ownAFrequency refers to the actual occurrence of a particular tag in a tag cloud, scot:ownRFrequency represents the percentage frequency of a tag within a particular tag cloud, relative to the total of all tag frequencies in that tag cloud. There are many attributes to describe string and literal values for a specific purpose, e.g. tags:name, tagont:prefTagLabel, nao:preLabel, and ec:hasLabel for describing tag's name. Object Type. The object type properties relevant in the context of this study are summarised in Table 4 . SCOT, Echarte and Knerr provide the possibility to define a tagging activity. In SCOT, there is no local property to describe who is involved in a tagging activity. For this purpose SCOT reuses Newman's tags:taggedBy attribute. Via SCOT one can describe who uses tags via the scot:usedBy property. Meanwhile, three ontologies have the property to identify a location or source in which the tagging occurred. TagOnt provides tagont:hasServiceDomain to link the tagging activity to the ServiceDomain, Echarte provides ec:hasSource with the Source as its range value, whereas SCOT provides scot:tagspace with a range of sioc:Site. The relation between tags and resources is defined via tags:isTagOf , nao:isTagFor , and scot:tagOf properties in theNewman, NAO and SCOT ontologies respectively. They also provide inverse properties for this relation. Defining relations between tags is one of the benefits of using an ontology to model folksonomies, since this effectively gives semantics to tags in a tag set. Nevertheless only SCOT and Newman take advantage of this possibility. Whereas Neman provides very restricted properties such as tags:equivalentTag and tags:relatedTag, SCOT provides many more attributes such as scot:spellingVariant and scot:delimited. The spelling variant property is further refined into scot:acronym, scot:plural, scot:singular and scot:synonym. In addition, the latter has further subproperties to define specific synonym types, i.e. scot:hypenatated, scot:underscored, scot:slashed, and scot:spaced. In comparison to other ontologies, SCOT specifically provides attributes that represent characteristics of folksonomies such as scot:hasUsergroup, scot:createdBy, scot:contains, and scot:taggingActivity. To conclude this section we briefly give a summary of the comparison. So far, tag ontologies have mainly been used for representing tagging activities, and only to a minor extent for modeling the features of folksonomies. According to the Folksonomy model given in Section 3.2, SCOT is suitable for this model. But, we might argue that the surveyed ontologies have different ontological purposes and different expressivity. Therefore, as an ideal solution we might need to interlink among the proposed ontologies. In the first half of this paper we proposed a model for collaborative tagging activities and folksonomies -based on the widely accepted model for tagging. The detailed comparisons presented in Section 4 support several general concluding observations about ontologies related to tagging activities and their usefulness in collaborative tagging systems. This research can be considered as a first attempt to systematically compare different conceptualisations of semantic tagging for collaborative tagging systems. We believe that tag ontologies should be evaluated with respect to a particular goal, application or scenario rather than merely for the sake of an evaluation. Our observations take into consideration two separate criteria -the depth of tagging data per se, and the collaborative aspect in folksonomies. As we mentioned in the start of the paper, tag ontologies are in an early stage and current approaches need to be elaborated or combined to enrich schemas and meet both criteria. Nevertheless the surveyed ontologies already offer an improved opportunity for collaborative tagging systems -especially given the machineprocessable representations that they can provide. Following the comparison of the tag ontologies we arrived at the following conclusions: • There is agreement on the issue as to what are the most elementary building blocks of a model for the tagging. The building blocks consist of the taggers, the tags themselves, and the resources being tagged. • Different individuals create substantially different conceptualisations of tagging data and tagging activities despite the fact that their purposes are similar. • The tag model does not cover overall characteristics of a folksonomy. SCOT, combined Gruber's conceptual model and Newman's vocabularies, is the ontology that must be suitable to represent collaborative tagging activities and it provides the most appropriate representations for the Folksonomy model as we defined it. In addition linking between SCOT and MOAT is useful way to complement to define a meaning of tag. Toward the Semantic Web DCMF: DC & Microformats, a Good Marriage During the Web 1.0 years , the usual method for including semantic information within documents was using the HTML header <meta> elements, as well as <title>, <address>, <link>, <del>, <ins> elements and \"title\" and \"cite\" attributes. This continues in the present, but the abuse and misuse of <meta> elements forces search engines to ignore this information. With the introduction and growing popularity of XML, and the first Recommendation status of W3C's RDF in February 1999 , or, historically, using special user agents like Metabrowser, which allowed the user to browse both the information and the metainformation within a webpage. Microformats originated from a grassroots movement lead by Tantek Çelik to make recognizable data items capable of automated processing by software agents, as well as directly readable by human beings . The official website of microformats.org says that they are \"designed for humans first and machines second, microformats are a set of simple, open data formats built upon existing and widely adopted standards\". A microformat is a Web-based data formatting approach seeking to re-use existing content as metadata, using only X/HTML classes and other attributes for encoding. Microformats are simple conventions for embedding semantic markup in human-readable documents. They make use of implicit and explicit X/HTML characteristics in order to add simple semantic information via: • relationship links using \"rel\" and \"rev\" attributes on <a> and <link> elements. Besides the default defined types of relationship in the HTML specification, they can also be extended using profiles. • \"class\" and \"id\" attributes of most X/HTML elements. In this case, in addition to its support for display , these attributes may be used for other different functionalities. Web developers frequently make use of meaningless values for class names and identifiers. However, source code comprehension can be enhanced and extra information added for instance using \"header\", \"menu\" and \"footer\" for page layout definition. In December 2005 Google did an analysis of a sample of slightly over a billion documents, extracting information about popular class names, elements, attributes, and related metadata. One of the goals of that project was to know if any logic or semantics were used in class names. The conclusion was that there is no uniformity in naming classes. As a consequence, it is hard to parse documents in order to extract semantic information, except when microformats are used. The main goal of microformats is to solve problems created by inconsistent labeling, for instance, defining events, people, relationships, etc. through the creation of simple elements and element sets. Some of the microformat element sets are associated with widely adopted standards or schema, such as hCard and hCalendar ; some others have a newer origin, like \"rel-tag\" microformats, used to simplify blog indexing through Technorati. There are also other globally used microformats such as \"vote-links\" for electronic voting, \"hReview\" for media reviews, \"hResume\" for resumes, and \"XFN\" for social networks, etc. One of the most obvious and important benefits of using microformats -besides easy encoding and quick distribution-is the ability to easily parse web documents to look for microformats and extract them. There are a number of Web services that exploit this semantic information such as: Technorati 28 to find Weblog posts, Upcoming.org 29 to extract hCalendar definitions of events, and Yahoo! Tech 30 publishing of products reviews etc. Yahoo! has also implemented a search engine for Creative Commons licensed documents 31 , and Yahoo! Search parses almost every defined microformat. We started the Dublin Core MicroFormats project in 2005, taking advantage of Dublin Core's versatility, general purpose applicability, its formal standardization and the wide promotion by the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative . Dublin Core is a metadata schema which is syntactic-independent so it is suitable for encoding semantics within a microformats structure. So, DCMF allow us to extend the indisputable advantages of DCMI -simplicity, flexibility, diffusion and appropriateness-to any domain. All of the microformats have been created with a concrete goal, and the general goal of DC Microformats is to describe web resources . But DC microformats are also particularly appropriate to encode bibliographic descriptions of resources, such as magazines, books, articles, in any media, including paper or digital. Let's see an example of how we can describe Tim Berners-Lee's book using semantic information encoded as DCMF. The following code will represent this information in an X/HTML webpage: <dl class=\"dublincore\"> <dt>Title:</dt> <dd class=\"title\">Weaving the Web</dd> <dt>ISBN:</dt> <dd class=\"identifier\">0062515861</dd> <dt>Author:</dt> <dd><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee\" class=\"creator\">Tim Berners-Lee</dd></dl> According to the example, to use DC microformats, we need: 1. An X/HTML element with the class or identifier \"dublincore\", which acts as container of a DC microformat and identifies it. 2. A string which represents the semantic expressed by the microformat . 3. An X/HTML element with the \"class\" or \"id\" attributes, whose value is the appropriate DC element to indicate the semantic information to machines ; and also the value of the element/property . If we declare the information expressed in the microformat in RDF nomenclature , we should speak about: resource, property and value, where: • resource, is the value of the element with \"identifier\" class or id, if it exists; • property, is the value of the class expressed for both; for humans and for machines • and value, is the content of X/HTML elements with the class or identifiers of the last item . There are many tools to extract and/or generate metadata with DCMI elements, but none allows us to create microformats, except Dublin Core Metadata Gen, which was incorporated into the DCMF project. Dublin Core Metadata Gen is an application developed in PHP that generates three kinds of DC metadata: RDF, X/HTML using <meta> elements and also, per the project presented here, DCMF. In Dublin Core Metadata Gen, you can enter the data into a template and get: DC in RDF, DC in X/HTML using <meta> elements, and DC in microformats. The Dublin Core Microformats Viewer is an add-on for Firefox and Flock browsers. This user agent's extension detects DC microformats when is then included in the X/HTML code of the webpage. Like Dublin Core Viewer Extension add-on , DC Microformats Viewer installs a little icon in the status bar, letting the users open a pop-up window containing a table with the Dublin Core microformats present in the current page. This tool is only a simple extension with simple functionality, but it also shows the ease of extracting metainformation from DC microformats, and the potential of this approach. Microformats are another way of expressing metadata in general, and DC in particular, embedded in web resources. If we compare microformats encoding with the use of <meta> elements, and/or with RDF syntax, microformats have some advantages and distinctive characteristics: • Easy to create. Microformats make participation in Web 2.0 social collaboration easier for content creators. Any web content creator can write microformats easily. The only required knowledge is basic X/HTML and X/HTML authoring tools. • Easy to recognize and use. The information can be read by people using their user agents. Users also can extend their browsers' functionalities , to combine pieces of information on websites with applications . There are also disadvantages. Probably microformats are less known than the <meta> element, because microformats belong to the emerging domain of the Web 2.0. Also microformats are more limited than RDF; for example, they can not formally define complex relationships and microformats' scope are narrower that the descriptive potential of RDF. Despite all those limitations, microformats are a way to work with DC metadata in the context of Web 2.0, allowing authors to generate semantic information easily comprehensible to both people and machines. Web services can also be developed to support DC microformats, as for any other existing microformats. Examples might include article repositories, books, magazines, etc that allow people to add and find bibliographic records easily. Microformats, have been also called as \"lower-case Semantic Web\" but they are a very important inflection point within the Semantic Web. Standards like GRRDL, a recent W3C Recommendation, demonstrate that mechanisms from Gleaning Resource Descriptions from Dialects of Languages, are needed to extract Semantic Web Information from X/HTML microformats . In a post on his blog, Stu Weibel wrote: The flexibility that microformats afford is an essential feature of the hyper-innovation that characterizes Web 2.0, but he wondered if Dublin Core fits in the microformats' philosophy. In this report we answer \"YES\": Dublin Core fits perfectly in the microformats' philosophy, just as it does in the context of the \"classic\" Semantic Web. Adopting microformats as a new way to express semantic information with DC allows us to expand the use of DC to new domains that, otherwise, would not use it. In addition, the nature of DC as a general purpose metadata model implicitly suggests its use in microformats for describing resources, especially the bibliographic types of resources previously mentioned. Microformats avoid the problems of updating and synchronizing the information in many sources or formats . But microformats especially are intended to allow people to participate in and take advantage of the Semantic Web in the specific situations already mentioned. The DCMF project intends to combine the simplicity and flexibility of Dublin Core with the possibilities that microformats offer. DCMF is an attempt to make semantic information easy and practical. Furthermore, the ease of parsing web documents with microformats lets us use this semantic information for Web services useful to people. Future work on DC microformats will be the evolution and improvement of those tools described here , and the development of Web services for querying the information within DC microformats. Even though bibliographic exchange has been a reality for decades, exchange of authority information and links between records are still not widely implemented. The standard way of making bibliographic data available is still through search-retrieve protocols such as SRU/W 32 or Z39.50 33 . Though this makes single bibliographic records retrievable, it does not provide a way to directly address them and reveals little or nothing about links between records. In contrast the Semantic Web is by definition built upon linking of information. The promise of the Semantic Web and Linked Data is that it could make data connected, simply by making it available. This, it seems, could be the perfect way for libraries to expose all of their data. A goal when creating the new version of the LIBRIS web interface 34 was to make the information presented to a normal user transparently available to machines/web robots as well. It was also obvious that information not intrinsic to the record itself, such as user annotations and connections to other records could be made available this way. Also, thirty years of continually changing cataloguing rules and practices have left some data in an inconsistent state. Our hope is that the result of the work described will help us work with data in a new and better way. The Swedish Union Catalogue comprises about 175 libraries using a single Integrated Library System for cataloguing. MARC21 is used for bibliographic, holdings and authority records. It contains about six million bibliographic records. A number of components were developed to make the ILS \"talk RDF\". We created an RDF server wrapper to make the ILS accessible through HTTP and able to deliver RDF describing bibliographic and authority resources upon request, as well as RDF describing the links between them. Persistent URIs were created by using each record's unique number, these URIs can be dereferenced and will deliver the RDF when queried properly through HTTP content negotiation. 32 Search/Retrieval via URL -http://www.loc.gov/standards/sru/ 33 Z39.50 -http://www.loc.gov/z3950/agency/ 34 LIBRIS -http://libris.kb.se/ This data could then be loaded into a triple store to enable searching using SPARQL . In this section we will outline the individual components of the implementation. A schematic is provided in FIG. 1 . The first step was to create a wrapper around the ILS that could deliver the records in RDF rather than the binary format normally used for bibliographic records . The wrapper talks to the ILS using SQL and delivers records given its unique number. It then converts the ISO2709 record into an XML representation of MARC21. In the final step a transformation is applied to the XML using XSLT . Since each output format is implemented in a single XSLT-file, adding a new format or making changes to an existing one is trivial. Links and access are crucial underpinnings of both the semantic and \"normal\" web. For a resource to be linkable it needs a URI, for it to be accessible, that URI should be a HTTP one. Following the four rules of Linked Data , a persistent, dereferenceable URI is created for each record. For bibliographic records: http://libris.kb.se/resource/bib/<number>, and for authority records: http://libris.kb.se/resource/auth/<number>. Using HTTP content negotiation, the correct format can be delivered depending on the clients capabilities. This method uses the HTTP Accept header to tell the server what media types the client can handle and prefers. For example, the accept header text/html tells the server to deliver an HTML page suitable for a human user. An accept header containing, for example, text/rdf+n3 or application/rdf+xml tells the server that the client is able to handle RDF. The server can either deliver the data in RDF directly or send an HTTP 302 or 303 response indicating that the information can be found at a different URL . See Appendix A for an example of content negotiation. We were interested in using SPARQL as a tool to both query and analyze data. Some queries that can be hard, or impossible, to formulate using SQL or a full text search language are easily formed using SPARQL. For example, the following query: \"show me all subjects of records that belongs to the same work as the record with identifier XYZ\". A query like this can be very useful for someone wanting to \"auto complete\" missing subject entries on records belonging to the same work. We used the Jena Semantic Web Framework 35 to create a triple store to hold the data. This gave us, with a minimum of work, the possibility to query data using SPARQL. A SPARQL endpoint conforming to the SPARQL Protocol for RDF was implemented to allow queries over HTTP. There are a number of types of resources that needs to be described or made available to reflect the current state of a library catalogue, e.g books, authors, subjects , organizations, links between them, etc. To make the library catalogue available to systems outside the library community, the resources should be described using common vocabularies. We used Dublin Core for bibliographic data, FOAF 36 for persons and organizations, and SKOS 37 for controlled vocabularies. These are all widely used and understood standards. An example graph is displayed in FIG. 2 . See Appendix A for example records. It is important to point out that it is possible to deliver multiple formats in parallel, so catering to the world outside the library community does not exclude systems aware of library standards. As described in 3.1 RDF Server Wrapper adding support for Bibliontology, MODS, MarcOnt or any other standard is easy, it is, however, not the subject of this paper. The Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records has been around for a decade, much has been written about it, though actual implementations are few. One hurdle to overcome is the shifting quality of the records due to continually changing practices. However, the idea of grouping or linking records being part of the same work is an appealing and technically viable one. Every record in the LIBRIS database gets assigned one or more FRBR-keys, these keys are the normalized concatenations of an author and the original title. The process is repeated for each author and title. For example, the book \"The Difference Engine\" by William Gibson and Bruce Sterling has two keys: \"GIBSON WILLIAM 1948 THE DIFFERENCE ENGINE\", and \"STERLING BRUCE 1954 THE DIFFERENCE ENGINE\". Links are then created between records with the same key. This is similar to the approach of Styles et al. where the MD5 checksum of the name of the author and the title of the work are used as an identifier. However, an important distinction compared to Styles et al. is that these keys are transient; they are never used as identifiers, only to create the links between records of the same work. This way, when an author dies, changes his/her name, etc. the links remain the same even though the keys change. There is therefore no need to keep track of changes since no identifier has been published. Another advantage is that works with more than one author is handled automatically, as well as records containing more than one work. The LIBRIS database also contains actual work records in the form of name+title authority records. These are linked to their respective bibliographic records. The sheer amount of bibliographic records prohibits manual creation of these for the whole database, nevertheless these links are included in the RDF. Linking to external resources gives the client a way of finding more information about a given resource. As a proof-of-concept the LIBRIS database contains a handful of links from authority records to DBpedia and Wikipedia. See Appendix A for an example. We have also experimented with user annotation using the annotea ontology. Since the URIs used to identify records/resources are available outside the ILS, attaching data, such as user reviews, to them is easy and non-intrusive. Although there are a number of ontologies available to describe bibliographic data, the data contained in library systems are not generally available. The access mechanisms described in Linked Data need to be implemented for libraries to truly be \"part of the semantic web\". SPARQL shows real promise when it comes to mining the bibliographic data for information due to it's linked nature. Planned next steps include using SPARQL for automatic creation of work records, implementing a richer description of bibliographic and authority records and loading more external data into the triple store. We are closely following the work of the DCMI/RDA Task Group 38 . We are currently exploring the possibility of making parts of this work available as Open Source. More information will be available at http://libris.kb.se/semweb. Metadata Scheme Design, Application, and Use The Dryad repository 39 is a partnership between the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center 40 and the School of Information and Library Science, Metadata Research Center 41 at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The repository hosts data supporting published research in the field of evolutionary biology. Dryad is currently working collaboratively with ten leading journals that publish evolutionary biology research, including Evolution, The American Naturalist, and Ecology. These journals have agreed to integrate their submission systems with Dryad in the near future, eventually creating a seamless publication process from author to journal to Dryad data deposition. Two goals informing Dryad's current metadata activities include: 1. Dryad's need to be interoperable with other data repositories used by evolutionary biologists; and 2. Dryad's need for a sustainable information infrastructure. The first goal has inspired our development of the Dryad application profile, version 1.0; and the second goal has led to Dryad's adoption of DSpace software and technology. Current metadata activities for the Dryad development team include revising the project's application profile so that it is compliant with the Singapore Framework. The Singapore Framework is a model that was released at the 2007 Dublin Core conference approximately a year after our team created the DRIADE application profile, version 1.0 . Ongoing Dryad metadata work also includes evaluating the effectiveness of our revised application profile and integrating it into a DSpace environment. This report reviews these two metadata focused activities, and highlights recent accomplishments and challenges. Dryad's metadata application profile, ver.1.0, has two modules; one module describes data objects, and the other module describes the associating publication. We developed the application profile to support basic resource and data discovery, with the goal of being interoperable with other data repositories used by evolutionary biologists. The application profile is designed to automatically capture as much metadata as possible during publication and data deposition processing. The application profile incorporates elements from the following established metadata schemes: Dublin Core, Darwin Core, Data Documentation Initiative , Ecological Metadata Language , and PREservation Metadata Implementation Strategies . The Dryad application profile, ver. 1.0, supports Dryad's phase one functionalities that were established in a stakeholders' workshop in December 2006 42 . These functionalities include the capturing, basic preservation, and simple retrieval of datasets and metadata for associated publications. In the future, metadata elements from other metadata schemes will be needed for projected features. Dryad's phased development and corresponding functionalities are summarized in Table 1 . DSpace is a software package for digital repository systems 43 . DSpace provides basic services to deposit, store, search, and retrieve digital content, but it was designed for a particular use case , and significant modifications will be required to make DSpace suit the needs of Dryad users. Although the DSpace infrastructure has been adopted by many repositories, research on the integration of application profiles, especially those complying with the Singapore Framework, is still limited. Implementing the first iteration of the Dryad application profile in DSpace is allowing us to test the application profile, as well as evaluate the long-term applicability of DSpace for Dryad's needs. DSpace was chosen due to its adaptability and support of Dublin Core metadata, as well as the DSpace community's support for enhancing metadata functionality, as evidenced by developments such as the SKOS module. Although most DSpace functionality revolves around qualified Dublin Core metadata, the software collects additional metadata that can be used to fill in details of the application profile, including qualifiers associated with elements drawn from other metadata schemes. Metadata fields not native to DSpace are configured as custom fields, which can be stored, searched, and displayed in the same manner as the native fields. A major advantage of DSpace is its system for managing user accounts, which can be adapted for the eventual Dryad functionality of allowing end-users to submit content and create basic metadata. However, the default workflow for submitting content and generating metadata in DSpace is entirely too long and awkward for end-users, and is further complicated by the needs of the Dryad metadata model. A more configurable submission system is included in the recently released DSpace 1.5, but significant work will still be required to allow users to submit content without difficulty. One drawback of the DSpace model is that metadata with hierarchical information are not supported by the core repository. Hierarchical information, which is necessary for tracking data such as contact information for multiple authors of a publication, must be stored in an extra file attached to the object, and modifications must be made to the default DSpace functionality if any of this information is to be used beyond simple display. Another difficulty of using DSpace is the lack of a configurable access control system, a critical feature for Dryad. One requirement of Dryad is to collect and store publications to facilitate automatic metadata generation, while simultaneously shielding these publications from end-users. Some of the content stored in Dryad will need to be placed under embargo. While others have implemented these features in DSpace, the core distribution does not include them. Modifications to the core DSpace code must be kept to a minimum if we are to take advantage of future upgrades. Therefore, it will be challenging to optimize Dryad for users and metadata creators while minimizing deviation from the core DSpace platform. The Singapore Framework provides a model for the structure of Dublin Core application profiles . Conformance with the Singapore Framework includes the benefits of consistency, long-term quality control, and interoperability with other metadata structures. A significant effort over the last few months has been to bring the Dryad application profile, ver. 1, which is based largely on Dublin Core, in line with the Singapore Framework. Reasons for this step include the benefits noted by Nilsson, et al. , as well as, our goal to comply and interoperate with Semantic Web standards. All five Singapore Framework components have been examined for the Dryad metadata schema adaptation . The five components include the following: 1. Functional requirements; 2. Domain model; 3. Description Set Profile; 4. Usage guidelines; and 5. Encoding syntax guidelines. With the exception of the optional encoding syntax guidelines, the other four components have been deemed appropriate for the Dryad's application profile revision. The Scholarly Works Application Profile 44 is a key example of an application profile in conformance with the Singapore Framework, and provides a model for the Dryad description. The results of the initial restructuring can be found online as part of the repository project wiki. Addressing the Singapore Framework's first mandatory component, Dryad's functional requirements are based on project system requirement specifications. Using the SWAP example as a model, the Dryad's functional requirements address scope, stakeholders and designated community, requirements gathering, and functional requirements. Dryad's functional requirements include supporting the following operations: 1. resource discovery and use; 2. data interoperability; 3. computer-aided metadata generation and augmentation; 4. linking publications and underlying datasets; 5. data and metadata quality control; and 6. Data security. The designated community for the Dryad application profile includes researchers in the field of evolutionary biology who are generating data and reusing data for their own projects and scientists searching for datasets that are applicable to their own research. Stakeholders are evolutionary biologists, journal publishers in the field of evolutionary biology, professional societies in evolutionary biology, and NESCent. The methodology employed to gather system requirements involved assessing the needs and goals of individuals and groups identified as stakeholders and community members through a workshop held in December 2006 at NESCent in Durham, North Carolina, and more recently an ongoing use case study. Full details about the application profile functional requirements have been added to the Dryad project wiki46.The second mandatory component of the Singapore Framework is the domain model. Unlike the SWAP example, the Dryad application profile is \"data-centric\" rather than document-or publication-centric. Dryad's application profile, ver. 1.0, accommodates a single publication or article with published data from one or more datasets. This relationship is represented in Figure 2 . The third mandatory component, the Description Set Profile is proving to be the most challenging aspect of the application profile revision process. As previously mentioned, the Dryad application profile is based largely on Dublin Core, but also incorporates elements from domain-specific namespaces such as PRISM, DDI, EML, and DarwinCore. None of the namespaces, except Dublin Core, are currently represented in RDF and cannot be included in the DSP. The Dryad development team has been discussing whether or not to declare unique elements for Dryad use in order to complete the Description Set Profile. Despite this challenge, the first draft of the Dryad DSP, which only includes Dublin Core elements, is available for viewing 47 . The fourth component, which is optional, is the usage guidelines, which have been collaboratively developed by Dryad team members and also appear online. The Dryad usage guidelines provide descriptions of each element and details regarding use 48 . Additionally, the guidelines also elaborate upon the constraints defined by the DSP. The application profile revisions undertaken to comply with the Singapore Framework has strengthened the overall metadata architecture of the Dryad repository. It has also helped the project team identify key challenges, such as limitations in the current state of citation metadata, and the project's need to encode rights metadata. Furthermore, it has aided the Dryad development team in identifying metadata issues, and clarifying those issues that require administrative or policy decision, prior to determining the appropriate metadata element or value. The most pressing issue facing the Dryad team is to determine how or if elements from non-Dublin Core namespaces should be included in the Dryad DSP and how the elements will be represented during DSpace implementation. The inclination is to use what has already been determined by a community to be useful, and furthermore to take advantage of the work and documentation already available from other initiatives; however, the issues with interoperability remain unavoidable at this time. Therefore, the Dryad team may choose to declare unique elements for the repository project. The benefits of moving forward in line with the Singapore Framework are critical to the longterm success of Dryad and its ability to take advantage of metadata to improve system performance. The ongoing revision of the Dryad application profile, ver. 1, will result in the release and publication of the Dryad application profile, ver. 2.0. As part of our application profile development work, we are also taking into account selected functionalities of Dryad's phase two . Additional ongoing activities include revising Dryad's interface for entering metadata and streamlining the metadata creation and submission process to support authordepositors. As Dryad evolves, we are anticipating that the recent release of DSpace 1.5 will impact the amount of work the project is able to complete with respect to specific metadata goals and other desired functionalities. In conclusion, Dryad's metadata structure is evolving, and will be revised over time, taking into consideration Semantic Web standards and innovations that support the overall goals of Dryad. Effective metadata standards are required to efficiently handle the large amounts of data collected in imaging and scholarly studies of the earliest known copy of Archimedes' work. The Dublin Core Metadata Element Set is being utilized to provide key identification information, with additional metadata extensions to ensure the imaging and scholarly information can be readily integrated in a Web 2.0 environment. Applying the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative Metadata Element Set and additional elements from the DCTerms namespace to a variety of images containing different texts in a rapidly changing technology environment has posed a unique set of challenges. These challenges include linking together and integrating data from different sources and formats: Digital images from advanced cameras in numerous spectral bands, and digitally encoded texts in varied fonts from a team of scholars. With increased focus on data management and explosive growth in data with advanced imaging techniques, the application of the DCMI Metadata Element Set provides a robust data set that will meet worldwide metadata standards. The Archimedes Palimpsest Program is a 10-year effort to produce digital images of Archimedes' text as originally written on parchment in the latter half of the tenth century. In the early thirteenth century, this text was scraped off and overwritten, or \"palimpsested,\" to create a prayer book. A team of scientists and scholars has been digitally imaging and studying the 174 parchment leaves that currently make up the Archimedes Palimpsest. Since the 2006 Dublin Core Conference the program has developed new imaging techniques that have yielded over two terabytes of data. This includes images of the only copies of Archimedes treatises The Method and Stomachion; the only copy in Greek of On Floating Bodies; and copies of the Equilibrium of Planes, Spiral Lines, The Measurement of the Circle, and Sphere and Cylinder. Imaging has also revealed ten leaves of text by the fourth century B.C. Greek orator Hyperides; six leaves of commentaries on Aristotle; four liturgical leaves; and twelve leaves from two unidentified books. At the time of the 2006 Dublin Core Conference, the imaging team had imaged the entire palimpsest with three spectral bands of light, yielding three images for each leaf and processed \"pseudocolor\" images in what was then considered to be a large data set of about 240 Gigabytes of data. Since the 2006 conference, the imaging team developed new imaging techniques to yield more information with more advanced cameras and lighting in 12 spectral bands. These yielded 16 images of each leaf and more refined processed images with a total of about 2,400 GB of data. Managing all this data required careful metadata logging and data management based on the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set. The Archimedes Palimpsest team also created images of key leaves at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory using X-ray fluorescence. This required an extensive range of metadata extensions to capture the broad range of metadata on energy levels and system parameters. They also imaged original prints of photographs of the Archimedes Palimpsest taken almost 100 years earlier at the direction of John Ludwig Heiberg in Constantinople, and photographs of one leaf taken in Chicago in the 1930's. These images of the photographs offered standardized images of text that has since been lost, and one leaf that has been lost in its entirety. With 6,797 digital images and 130 pages of transcriptions of the Archimedes Palimpsest, metadata has proved to be essential for 1) accessing images and integrating spectral bands for digital processing and enhancement, 2) managing transcriptions from those images for study by scholars around the world, and 3) linking and integrating the images and the transcriptions. This work required extensive identification metadata to ensure the data was manageable, as well as spatial metadata to line up and register the various images. The Dublin Core Metadata Element Set offers the key identification elements required for image storage, management and retrieval, with additional spatial and spectral information added as extensions. The \"Identification,\" \"Data Type\" and \"Data Content\" metadata elements incorporate the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set. The \"Spatial Data Reference\" and \"Imaging and Spectral Data Reference\" elements are extensions to the DCMI Standards, using metadata elements detailed in the Federal Geographic Data Committee Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata. The standard is hosted on the www.archimedespalimpsest.org website. In keeping with the project goals of long term data and metadata accessibilty, the program follows the DCMI's principble of simplicity. We have created records that are machine-readable with very little effort and easily intelligible by a human reader. Each image metadata record is a series of simple name-value pairs, employing Dublin Core and project-specific metadata elements . Since the 2006 Dublin Core Conference, individuals with standards experience in OCLC and other organizations have provided input on the best application of the Dublin Core Standard to the Archimedes Palimpsest Metadata Standard. A range of organizations have also provided guidance on the use of standards for archival purposes, including guidance for the best use of standards in the digital data set to ensure users years hence will have access to the actual versions of the standards used in creating the data set. Input from the Library of Congress, the British Library, NASA and Google proved fruitful in defining the application of standards not only to the Web 2.0 environment, but the range of possible digital environments possible in decades to come. Scholars have been transcribing the Greek text since the initial digital imaging, revealing new information about the origins of mathematical theories and science. The integration of these scholarly transcriptions in digital form with the digital images has taken on greater impetus since the 2006 Dublin Core Conference, with the digital tagging and encoding of text in various forms and formats, including handwritten, MSWord Symbol font, and various other custom fonts. A team of scholars and students is encoding the transcribed text into XML tagged Unicode following the Text Encoding Initiative standards . <seg TEIform=\"seg\" n=\"17v1\" part=\"N\" type=\"folio\"> <seg TEIform=\"seg\" n=\"1\" part=\"N\" type=\"line\"> <supplied TEIform=\"supplied\" reason=\"lost\"> <expan TEIform=\"expan\">ὅτι</expan> τὸ ΦΑ</supplied> μέγε<supplied TEIform=\"supplied\" reason=\"lost\">θος</supplied> τῶι βάρει πρὸς </seg> <seg TEIform=\"seg\" n=\"2\" part=\"N\" type=\"line\"> <supplied TEIform=\"supplied\" reason=\"lost\">τὸ ὑγρ</supplied>ὸν τὸ ἰσόογκον τοῦτον ἔχει</seg> <seg TEIform=\"seg\" n=\"3\" part=\"N\" type=\"line\">τὸν λόγον, ὃν τὸ Α <expan TEIform=\"expan\">πρὸς</expan> τὸ Φ<unclear TEIform=\"unclear\" >Α</unclear>.</seg> </seg> Header information is provided for each folio in the encoded text, with cross-walked Dublin Core Identification and Data Content metadata elements mapped to the TEI format . These encoded texts are then hosted with the images, with the Dublin Core elements providing a common structure for image and transcription metadata. The images and transcriptions are linked through metadata in the Archimedes Palimpsest Data Product, enabling common searches, access and study. The standard use of the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set across the products of the image scientists and scholars enables linkage between these two disparate data sets for further study . Integrating metadata of various types tailored to meet a range of users' needs has proven critical to making integrated data available across domains and disciplines amidst ever changing technologies. Building on the Archimedes Palimpsest application, the DCMI Standards are being used to integrate hyperspectral imaging of the Waldseemuller 1507 Map at the Library of Congress. The DCMI Standards serve as the basis for information discovery in the Web 2.0 environment, and hopefully for decades to come in future formats and technologies. This information will advance the study of the original manuscript by individuals around the world with ubiquitous access via the Internet. It has long been recognized that contextual metadata is important for facilitating access to documents in archival collections . More recently, digital collections have come to be understood as information seeking contexts through \"unitary\" 49 and \"analytic\" 50 descriptive approaches . Cultural heritage institutions have purposefully conceptualized and developed their digital collections in many ways, as \"displays\", \"tours\", \"tools\", \"lessons\", and to provide a record of cultural events . However, in a large digital federation or aggregation, the purpose of the original, deliberately built collections becomes difficult to discern. Collectionlevel metadata has the potential to provide important information about features of a parent collection and why it might be of value to users. But the qualitative aspects of collections are difficult to describe in a systematic way, as they may embody a good deal of intellectual intent and tend to be highly complex and mutable. This paper reports on the current phase of the Digital Collections and Content project that is investigating how to represent collection context for scholarly use of large-scale, heterogeneous digital aggregations. The DCC provides integrated access to over 200 digital 49 Defined as: \"consists only of information about the collection as a whole.", "meta": {"ref_id": "Greenbergetal."}}
{"text": "67 See for example . The authors, after evaluating different APIs for distributed KOS access, criticize the fact that most APIs mimic the data structure of the KOS too closely and don't support advanced operations like \"chunking\", i.e., the retrieval of a defined set of concepts with one request to the server. Steering clear of the intricate philosophical problem if a group of things constitutes an information resource while the things alone do not, the cited sources all suggest that concepts of a KOS should be treated as abstract objects . To represent that fact, the {resource} segment has been introduced into the URI to distinguish between the abstract DDC concept and a description of that concept. While http://dewey.info/class/338.4 indentifies the concept, http://dewey.info/ class/338.4/about identifies the information resource describing this concept. Since this last URI is designed to be representation-agnostic and provides links to more specific resources, it is in fact the generic representation of this resource. The benefit of pointing the agent to a generic information resource before negotiating the contents of the representation is mainly semantic. By using this technique it is made clear that all descriptions of the identified resource are variants of the same representation and roughly convey the same information. The relationship of each of those resources to the generic resource is such that they specify one or more dimensions of its genericity. For example, in our context http://dewey.info/class/338.4/about exemplifies an identifier for a generic resource, being about an abstract concept. The relationship between the URI and the representation of the resource it identifies may change over time, with respect to language and format requested. The use of the same URI will still be valid, however, because these new resources are considered more specific versions of the generic resource, and their respective relationships would be given as RDF statements about the dimension they specify. On the other hand, the resource that http://dewey.info/class/338.4/2008/04/03/about identifies or retrieves is only time-invariant but language-and format-generic, whereas for http:// dewey.info/class/338.4/2008/04/03/about.en.skos it is completely fixed. It should also be noted in this context that removing the language from the concept URI implies that a specific language version of a DDC concept can never be addressed as an abstract concept, but only as an information resource describing the abstract concept. The concept of generic resources is especially important for designating a canonical URI for a given set of resources/representations. The findings above suggest that a candidate for a canonical URI should identify the most generic in a set of resources that can be grouped together as variants of each other. There are numerous DDC entities that have not been addressed so far and will therefore not be addressable by the URIs shown above. That doesn't mean that they won't be accessible to applications, however. Even if one assumes that these entities might be irrelevant from a service perspective, it would perhaps be useful to achieve higher granularity for users of the full Dewey data file; and in representation formats like SKOS, every reference has to be a URI, anyway. One possibility would therefore be to use opaque URIs in the http://dewey.info/id namespace in parallel, which, for all entities that already have other identifiers, would have to be handled as URI aliases. This set could correspond directly and exhaustively to entities in the Dewey database as represented in MARC Classification and Authorities formats, its entities could be related by OWL and even be used publicly for permalinks. Another solution: the proposed scheme might be extended by adding fragment identifiers, enabling access to specific pieces of information beyond the level of the suggested URIs, for example, http://dewey.info/class/1--012/e22/about#caption to just indentify the caption \"Classification\" of that class, but these specific entities might be misleading if applied across different data formats , e.g., MARC Classification vs. SKOS. Another potential drawback is that fragment identifiers are stripped from the URI by the user agent, so a service endpoint will never see them. The usefulness of \"shortcuts\" has to be addressed in general as well. Every time a \"default\" is introduced, the expressiveness of the scheme is impoverished by de facto defining URI aliases for some resources. If http://dewey.info/concept/338.4 defaults today to the same representation that is retrieved by http://dewey.info/ concept/338.4/2008/04/04/about.en.html, the possibility is lost to use the original URI as a canonical identifier for the 338.4 concept independently of time, language, or format. Yet such an identifier is a powerful tool that could retrieve all information about translations, former versions of this concept etc. as OWL or RDF expressions, making it possible for an agent to just work from this resource for any given concept. A better general way of indicating shortcuts would be to interpret an unspecified {aspect} segment as trigger for defaulting behavior, for example: only http://dewey.info/338.4 would be defined as an alias of the fixed resource shown above, but not http://dewey.info/concept/338.4. The European Union has 23 official languages; many more regional and minority languages are spoken in the 27 member states. A 2006 European Commission/Eurobarometer study revealed that \"56% of EU citizens are able to hold a conversation in a language other than their mother tongue\", \"28% state that they master two languages along with their native language\", and \"approximately 1 in 10 respondents has sufficient skills to have a conversation in three languages\". In this linguistically diverse and multilingual environment in the EU, there is a tremendous need to provide cross-language access to information . However, European libraries not only do not share a language, they also have no common subject heading system, classification system, authority files, or bibliographic format. Thus, cross-language access to information in library collections is a complex and difficult problem involving not only natural language analysis and translation, but also the mapping of library subject headings, classifications, and bibliographic formats, presenting problems of both syntactic and semantic interoperability. The CACAO Project , begun in December 2007, is a 24-month targeted project supported by the eContentplus Programme of the European Commission. It is a consortium of nine partners: Cité des sciences et de l'industrie and Xerox Research Centre Europe from France; the Free University of Bozen-Bolzano, CELI, and Gonetwork from Italy; Kórnik Library from Poland; the National Széchényi Library and the Hungarian Academy of Sciences from Hungary; and Goettingen State and University Library of Germany. The libraries in the CACAO consortium use a total of at least six different subject heading systems and five different classification systems . Three of the libraries are multilingual libraries. CACAO will modify and extend work that has already been implemented at the Library of the Free University of Bozen-Bolzano, a multilingual library having major collections in Italian, German, and English, each with its own subject heading system, as described by Bernardi et al. . This report reviews two of the important metadata-related challenges that CACAO faces involving the specification of the language of the metadata fields, \"false friends\" and term ambiguity, and discusses our solutions. We begin with a short description of the CACAO architecture. Figure 1 -Architecture Overview , pg. 4) The CACAO architecture in Figure 1 is designed to support the following vision. A user should be able to enter a monolingual query, say cat in English, and retrieve highly relevant records not just in English, but also in any supported language in the database, including records containing, for example, the German word for cat, Katze, French chat, Hungarian macska, Italian gatto, or Polish kot. As a least-common-denominator solution, CACAO will harvest metadata through library OAI-PMH interfaces, minimally in Dublin Core; MARC 21 may also be accepted if available. The CACAO Corpus Analysis Subsystem performs a variety of analyses on the metadata off-line, the results of which are stored locally and used in support of online Query Processing. When the user enters a query, the Query Processing Subsystem, with the assistance of third-party Web Services providing linguistic analyses, translations, etc., translates and expands the query and matches it against the results of the Corpus Analysis Subsystem. Of course, resources such as lexica, multilingual dictionaries, and thesauri and other controlled vocabularies are accessed by the subsystems. We will use a simple example to illustrate some metadata-related problems that arise and some of the possible solutions that we are investigating; these are issues that are challenges not just for CACAO, but also for the library community. Suppose a user enters the query stove, wanting to retrieve records containing the English word stove or the German translation Herd. USER QUERY: stove The procedure might seem to be very simple: the Query Processing Subsystem looks up English stove in the English-German dictionary, retrieves the German translation Herd, and builds a Boolean search query containing those two expressions: QUERY: stove or Herd However, this simple query also retrieves false hits containing the English word herd: FALSE HIT: <dc:title>Animal status monitoring and herd management</dc:title> CORRECT: <dc:title>Herd und Ofen im Mittelalter</dc:title> CORRECT: <dc:title>The Stove-Top Cook Book</dc:title> English herd and German Herd are \"false friends\", i.e., words in different languages that look similar but that have different meanings. False friends are fairly common, for example English gift-German Gift , English pain-French pain , and English cane-Italian cane . Knowing or being able to determine the language of the terms in a given metadata field increases precision when dealing with false friends. The language would optimally be provided in the metadata itself, as we might find in a German-language catalog which owns the Englishlanguage book The Stove-Top Cook Book to which German-and English-language subject headings are assigned: <dc:title xml:lang=\"en\">The Stove-Top Cook Book</dc:title> <dc:subject xml:lang=\"de\">Herd</dc:subject> <dc:subject xml:lang=\"en\">Stove</dc:subject> In the case of a subject term, information about the source of the term in the <dc:subject> field could provide enough information to be able to deduce the language. In this case, we could deduce the language with a fairly high degree of certainty from the fact that the SWD is a German-language subject heading system: <dc:subject xsi:type=\"cacao:SWD\">Herd</dc:subject> This information about the language of the content of the field will be used by CACAO in presenting the ranked results list. Since the German term Herd appears in German-language fields in this record: <dc:title xml:lang=\"de\">Herd und Ofen im Mittelalter</dc:title> <dc:subject xsi:type=\"cacao:SWD\">Herd</dc:subject> it would be ranked higher than a record in which the false friend of the German translation of the original search term appears in an English-language field. Alternatively, such a record could be excluded entirely from the results list. <dc:title xml:lang=\"en\">Animal status monitoring and herd management</dc:title> 3.3. Solution 3: Association to a Class However, metadata are not always enriched with language or authority attributes as they are in this ideal catalog. CACAO's technical partners are developing a solution for this scenario, the association of terms to a fairly broad class in a library classification system such as the Dewey Decimal Classification . In our example, the off-line Corpus Analysis Subsystem must have been able to determine that materials about stoves are commonly classed in, e.g., DDC 640 , and it has stored this association: stove:DDC 640. One option would be to organize the results list according to class. For instance, records containing the terms stove or Herd with a <dc:subject xsi:type=\"dcterms:DDC\"> element having the DDC value provided by the Corpus Analysis Subsystem, 640: <dc:title>Herd und Ofen im Mittelalter</dc:title> <dc:subject xsi:type=\"dcterms:DDC\">640</dc:subject> would be presented in a group which would be ranked higher than groups of records containing one of those terms with some other DDC value for the <dc:subject> element, including records containing the false friend. <dc:title>Animal status monitoring and herd management</dc:title> <dc:subject xsi:type=\"dcterms:DDC\">630</dc:subject> The association to a class technique is used in information retrieval and in CACAO for an even more common problem: term ambiguity. The English word pipe, for instance, is ambiguous, meaning either \"a long tube\", German Rohr, or \"a device for smoking\", German Pfeife. For purposes of exposition, assume that on entering pipe as a search query, the user is asked which meaning is intended and that the user selects the meaning \"a long tube\". Using the association to a class technique, the Corpus Analysis Subsystem has determined that relevant materials are often classed in DDC 690 . Again, one option would be to organize the results list according to class, similar to the stove/Herd example. Records containing the terms pipe or Rohr and including a <dc:subject xsi:type=\"dcterms:DDC\"> element having the DDC value provided by the Corpus Analysis Subsystem, 690: <dc:title>Plumbers and pipe fitters library</dc:title> <dc:subject xsi:type=\"dcterms:DDC\">690</dc:subject> would be presented in a group which would be ranked higher than groups of records containing one of those terms with some other value for the <dc:subject> element, including records containing the term pipe in its unintended meaning: <dc:title>The pleasures of pipe smoking</dc:title> <dc:subject xsi:type=\"dcterms:DDC\">390</dc:subject> Association to a class can also be used to disambiguate an ambiguous target term. For instance, the English search term dog translated into Italian is cane. However, Italian cane has two senses, \"dog\" and \"cock of a weapon\", which would be disambiguated in the same way. Records containing the terms dog or cane and including a <dc:subject xsi:type=\"dcterms:DDC\"> element having the DDC value 630 would be presented in a group which would be ranked higher than groups of records containing one of those terms with some other value for the <dc:subject> element, including records containing the term cane in its unintended meaning. We have argued that the specification of the language of the metadata field, in addition to that of the document itself, is very important so that metadata can be fully exploited for crosslanguage purposes or in multilingual settings. If the metadata do not come with or cannot be enriched with the languages of the fields, then CACAO must rely on the association to a class technique, which will be needed in any case. Association to a class was originally designed for and will be used as a solution to the term ambiguity problem; it is similar to synsets used in WordNet and EuroWordNet, which CACAO may also use. The solution involving association to a class may also work as association to a subject heading, although that would require further preparation and testing. It is important to note that in the association to a class technique, the CACAO Corpus Analysis Subsystem must be able to associate a term such as English stove to some class and then the system must be able to match potential hits containing a term such as Herd against that same class. In other words, either the systems must contain the same classification system or their classification or subject headings systems must be mappable to the same system. Thus, CACAO's experience with cross-language access so far strongly supports Koch, Neuroth, and Day ; NKOS ; Chan and Zeng ; ; and many others in the library community who have discussed the importance of the interoperability of subject vocabularies and of classification systems for information retrieval in cross-domain environments. CACAO will rely on already existing mappings such as those provided by the MACS project , which has worked on mappings for RAMEAU , Library of Congress Subject Headings , and Schlagwortnormdatei . For optimal performance, even if the metadata of a given collection does not contain the specification for the language of the field as outlined in section 3.2, the Corpus Analysis Subsystem must still have access to such enriched metadata in order to avoid the false friends problem in its off-line analyses. For instance, if the Corpus Analysis Subsystem must determine which class German Gift \"poison\" is most commonly associated with, then it should avoid analyzing fields in which the English gift is found. However, we anticipate that the Corpus Analysis Subsystem will have access to a more extensive stored collection of associations between terms and classes than might be available for a given collection. A prototype of the CACAO information retrieval system was entered in the CLEF 2008 campaign, providing an opportunity to tune and evaluate the system on cross-language library metadata. CACAO's attention will soon turn to related issues involving metadata exchange and interoperability and thereby further explore the characteristics of Dublin Core in its crosslanguage duties. The European Library, whose Application Profile is Dublin Core-based, will integrate and evaluate CACAO technologies beginning in late 2008. Furthermore, CACAO libraries will be grouped into a single portal and CACAO will additionally create several thematic portals in order to further develop, demonstrate, and promote CACAO technologies. Other challenges include the complex relationships caused by differences of granularities of two original schemes and their presentation with various levels of SKOS elements; as well as the diverse coordination of entries due to the use of auxiliary tables and pre-coordinated headings derived from combining classes, subdivisions, and thesaurus terms, which do not correspond to existing unique identifiers. The poster reports the progress, shares the sample SKOS entries, and summarizes problems identified during the SKOS encoding process. Although OWL Lite and OWL Full provide richer expressiveness, the cost-benefit issues and the final purposes of encoding CCT raise questions of using such approaches. Simon Spero UNC Chapel Hill, USA ses@unc.edu Keywords: LCSH; Controlled vocabularies; Hierarchical relationships; visualization The Library of Congress Subject Headings has been developed over the course of more than a century, predating the semantic web by some time. Until the 1986, the only concept-toconcept relationship available was an undifferentiated \"See Also\" reference, which was used for both associative and hierarchical connections. In that year, in preparation for the first release of the headings in machine readable MARC Authorities form, an attempt was made to automatically convert these \"See Also\" links into the standardized thesaural relations. Unfortunately, the rule used to determine the type of reference to generate relied on the presence of symmetric links to detect associatively related terms; \"See Also\" references that were only present in one of the related terms were assumed to be hierarchical.

The fugitive ventral coloration origi-nally reported by Thomas and subsequently noted by Pine and Handley , Patton et al. , and Pavan and Voss was also seen in our fresh material. The ventral fur of MUSM 2083 , for example, was bright pink in life , but it soon faded to a dull beige on the dried skin. Although sample sizes are small, it seems noteworthy that adult males and adult females in our Peruvian material have nonoverlapping measurements for many craniodental dimensions . Ethnobiology: The Matses do not distinguish this species from other short-tailed opossums and therefore have no particular beliefs about it. Matses Natural History: The Matses have no definite knowledge of this species. Remarks: Of the five specimens we collected, one was captured in a Matses house surrounded by secondary vegetation; another was captured by hand in old secondary vegetation near a Matses swidden; another was trapped on the ground in valley-bottom primary forest; a third was trapped on the ground in primary forest growing on white sand; and the last was taken in a pitfall in swampy primary forest. The specimen from San Pedro was trapped \"on a hilltop in a primary terra firme forest\" . Based on these observations, it would seem that Monodelphis emiliae is a habitat generalist, although Patton et al. 's trapping results suggest that it might not occur in seasonally flooded forests. One of our specimens was taken on the same date, along the same trap line, and in the same habitat as a specimen of M. peruviana . Consistent with the Matses' observation that short-tailed opossums are diurnal, MUSM 11065 was captured by hand at 07:30 hrs, and MUSM 13298 was found at 17:00 hrs in a trap that had previously been checked and found empty at dawn.

{"text": "The original measurement of the hindfoot of the type, 34 mm, is larger than any seen in the El Caimito series , but our remeasurement of the dried hindfoot of FMNH 110943 29.6 5 8.7 5 4.6 5 1.4 5 6.2 5 2.3 5 3.0 5 3.3 5 5.2 5 16.7 5 1.9 5 11.8 5 ' Measurements defined by Voss .

Tabulated external measurements include specimens from series B, but craniodental measurements are from series A only. suggests that the real difference may be less. Most of the cranial measurements by which the type exceeds the range of variation in El Caimito specimens are dimensions that exhibit strong positive allometry in muroid rodents and are consistent with the hypothesis that the type is an older animal than any of the Venezuelan examples . The type has slightly smaller molars than any of the five El Caimito specimens we measured, but the latter sample is too sparse to adequately represent the true range of dental variation in the Venezuelan population from which it was taken. In side-by-side visual comparisons of El Caimito exemplars with FMNH 110943, the greatly overgrown facial skeleton of the latter is obvious. Although the molars of FMNH 110943 are no more worn than those of some El Caimito specimens , we suspect that the type is in fact much older. The skin tag of FMNH 110943 notes that it was taken in a live trap by US Army medical researchers, and the oddly blunted incisor wear facets suggest that the animal was maintained in captivity for some time thereafter. Captive-raised murids generally grow to a considerably larger size than would be expected based on toothwear comparisons with noncaptives, and such growth would disproportionately affect positively allometric facial traits. In our judgement, craniodental morphometric differences between the type and the El Caimito material do not exceed those that could be expected to accompany age and individual variation within a single population. In all qualitative external and craniodental traits preserved in our material , the El Caimito specimens are indistinguishable from FMNH 110943. Because Hershkovitz's description was based only on the type, and because some characters now widely used in muroid systematics were not mentioned in his text, we provide a supplementary description based on the more extensive material now at hand. This species closely resembles O. palustris in external appearance. The ears are small, and the mystacial vibrissae are dense and recurved along the oral margins. The tail, distinctly bicolored at the base, has prominent epidermal scales, and the ventral caudal hairs are longer than those of the caudal dorsum ; the tail tip is provided with a short pencil of terminal hairs. The hindfoot is distinctly modified for semiaquatic locomotion, with a thin fringe of silvery hairs along the metatarsal margins ; the claw of the fifth pedal digit extends to the end of the first phalange of dIV, but the claw of dl does not extend quite to the end of pi of dll. The plantar surface of the metatarsus is hairless and smooth, but distal to the thenar pad the plantar epithelium is so densely tubercular that the tiny hypothenar and interdigital pads are hard to distinguish. Small webs of skin are present between digits II, III and IV, but these do not extend more than half the length of the first phalange on any digit. Each pedal claw appears to be naked because the sparse, short hairs rooted at the base do not form prominent ungual tufts. In dorsal view, the skull is distinctive by its short, blunt rostrum flanked by broad, deep zygomatic notches. The interorbital region is strongly convergent anteriorly with well-developed supraorbital beads that project as small shelves over the posterior part of the orbital fossae; posteriorly, these beads are continued on each side as a low temporal crest along the posterolateral surface of the braincase. The zygomatic arches are subparallel in younger specimens, but become increasingly rounded and flaring in older animals. The interparietal is deep relative to its width , with an average depth/width ratio of 0.41 in five measured specimens. In lateral view, the zygomatic plate is broad, its anterior edge vertical or slightly slanting forward; the anterodorsal margin is rounded, with no hint of an acute spinous process in any specimen. The incisive foramina are long and narrow, widest near their midlength and tapering more-or-less symmetrically anteriorly and posteriorly from this point; the foramina extend between the first molar alveoli of one young adult but not quite that far in the other specimens at hand. The palatal bridge has shallow lateral gutters but no raised median keel; the bridge itself extends far behind the molar rows and bears prominent posterolateral pits. The anterior limit of the mesopterygoid fossa is a rounded arch and the roof of the fossa is completely bony with no trace of sphenopalatine vacuities. The buccinator-masticatory and accessory oval foramina are confluent because the bony strut of the alisphenoid bone that separates these foramina in other murids is absent. The configuration of foramina and grooves associated with the carotid arterial circulation matches that described for Oryzomys palustris by Carleton and Musser and represents the most derived of three alternative carotid morphologies known to occur among Neotropical murids . The auditory bullae are small and uninflated, with abruptly constricted eustacian tubes and globular tympanic capsules. The tegmen tympani does not overlap a posterior suspensory process of the squamosal. The hamular process of the squamosal is very broad, reducing the subsquamosal fenestra to an inconspicuous notch that is almont completely occluded in some specimens. The upper incisors are strongly opisthodont with yellow-orange enamel bands, and the lower incisor root is contained in a prominent bony capsule below the base of the coronoid process on the lateral surface of the mandible. The upper molar rows are parallel, and the cheekteeth appear small in relation to surrounding bony structures. In occlusal design, the upper and lower molars conform to the pattern described for Oryzomys palustris by Carleton and Musser . Accessory roots are present on Ml/ml, but these are hard to see in younger specimens because they are positioned under the molar crowns. The characters of Oryzomys gorgasi match those of the O. palustris group as diagnosed by Goldman , and the detailed resemblances between gorgasi and palustris are so many that the close relationship of these two species seems certain. In effect, palustris and gorgasi represent geographic extremes of a morphologically distinctive species complex that constitutes the irreducible phylogenetic core of the genus Ozyzomys. Derived morphological character states that appear to support the monophyly of a palustris group vis-ä-vis other species currently referred to the genus Oryzomys include the presence of small webs of skin between pedal digits II, III and IV; reduction or loss of the hypothenar metatarsal pad and small size of the interdigital plantar tubercles of the hindfoot; presence of a natatory fringe of hairs along the metatarsal margins; pedal claws not concealed by tufts of long ungual hairs; ventral caudal hairs longer than hairs of caudal dorsum; deep zygomatic notches; beaded-convergent supraorbital margins ; long incisive foramina; pattern 3 carotid circulation; undivided Ml anterocone and undivided ml anteroconid; and accessory roots present on Ml/ml. In addition to O. palustris and O. gorgasi, other taxa that share this set of diagnostic traits and clearly belong to the same taxonomic complex include O. couesi and O. dimidiatus . The name Micronectomys Hershkovitz, originally proposed as a subgenus of Nectomys with dimidiatus as type species . From all of these taxa, O. gorgasi differs by a unique combination of traits, including an unusually stout, blunt rostrum ; posteriorly tapering incisive foramina ; the complete absence of sphenopalatine vacuities; and a broad hamular process of squamosal that reduces the subsquamosal fenestra to a small notch on each side of the skull. By contrast, other species of the palustris complex have longer and more slender rostrums, incisive foramina that are more widely open posteriorly, and narrower squamosal hamular processes delimiting larger subsquamosal fenestrae. In addition, O. palustris t O. dimidiatus, and some nominal forms currently synonymized with O. couesi have distinct sphenopalatine vacuities in the dorsal roof of the mesopterygoid fossa. In summary, while a comprehensive taxonomic revision of the Oryzomys palustris complex is clearly needed, especially in view of trenchant character variation that we observed among Central American taxa currently treated as synonyms of O. couesi, our revaluation of the status of O. gorgasi based on the new material reported herein is consistent with Hershkovitz's hypothesis that this is a distinct species belonging to the nominotypical subgenus of Oryzomys. The presence of Oryzomys gorgasi on the south coast of the Gulf of Venezuela extends the known distribution of this species about 700 km ENE of its Colombian type locality and securely establishes the palustris group of Oryzomys as an element of the continental South American fauna. According to Hershkovitz , the type of O. gorgasi was collected in a swamp on the east bank of the Rio Atrato at 7°54'N, 77°00'W. ", "meta": {"ref_id": "10.1515_mamm.2001.65.2.205.json"}}

The mouse was given to me for study in May, 1925, at which time it had become somewhat tinged with yellow and would be described as pale cream in color. This male cream-colored mouse was mated with a normal agouti female from Elmira, Otsego County, Michigan. Elmira is less than forty miles from Douglas Lake and the same subspecies of deer-mouse occurs in both localities. Seven young wer~born from this mating, all normal agouti like the mother. A back-cross ofthese F 1 hybrids to the cream-colored male was attempted, but no offspring weresecured, perhaps because of the advanced age of the cream-colored individual. Matings of the F 1 generation mice among themselves produced thirteen F 2 mice, all of which were normal agouti in color. The stock then was turned over to H. W.' ", "meta": {"ref_id": "16"}}

{"text": "The opossum is said to occupy old leaf nests of the 'gray and fox-squirrels, where individuals often are killed by hunters who shoot through the nests. The mole occupies a type of habitat in the Bird Creek region that is quite different from that occupied by western members of the race. In western Oklahoma this animal is abundant in the stable sand dunes along the larger streams, but it is absent from the thin, baked soils of the adjacent uplands. In the Bird Creek region the mole is abundant in the heavy alluvium of the oak-elm association, where its preferred habitat is a moist forest floor with a good layer of humus and leaf-mold. Thlis habitat is similar to that occupied by the races pulcher and machrinoides in the Ozark region. Seven moles were trapped in the oak-elm association in Mohawk Park during the summer of 1935. Four specimens were taken in this association in the Garnett area during the first week of June, 1936. In the summer following the flood of 1935 the mole apparently was the only non-arboreal small mammal living in the flooded parts of the oak elm association. At various times during the summer fresh mole burrows were seen several hundred yards from the nearest unflooded land. These animals apparently retreated to high land when the lowland was inundated and quickly reoccupied it after the water subsided. Mole burrows occasionally have been found in upland situations where there is sufficient soil for their burrows. Numerous burrows were observed on the slopes of the Garnett ravines in the summers of 1935 and 1936, and occasional burrows were seen in cultivated fields adjoining the Garnett prairie. An adult, 'female mole was found at 7:30 p.m. on July 20, 1936, as it was traveling along a dusty road on the Garnett prairie. As there was cultivated land nearby it seems probable that the mole came from that rather than from the prairie, where burrowing would be almost impossible. Cryptotis parva. Little shrew. A male and female of this species with 5 suckling young were collected by A. P. Blair and P. F. Blair, Jr., on June 4, 1936, 2 miles northeast of Garnett. The animals were captured in a nest of shredded grass located beneath a limestone slab in the sumac grama association. The young were nearly grown, averaging 65 mm. in total length compared to 71 mm. in the adults. The shrews were kept in captivity for 24 hours during which time the young often were observed suckling the female. When the female was killed she was found to be pregnant. The 4 uterine swellings average 5.1 mm. in length. The little shrew apparently is rare in the region, as no other records were obtained. It is essentially a grassland animal, but possibly it may occur also in the forest as it does at times in other parts of its range. Blarina brevicauda carolinensis. Carolina shrew. The Carolina shrew was taken only in the oak-elm association. An adult male was trapped in this association in Mohawk Park on June 20, 1936, and an adult female was taken in Mohawk Park on July 30. An adult male was found dead by 0. W. Letson on November 14, 1935, in Mohawk Park. Three of these shrews were trapped in the oak-elm association on the Arkansas River flood-plain near Wekiwa, Tulsa County, west of the Bird Creek region. All were females, and all were taken on December 23, 1931. This content downloaded from 97.84.199.207 on Fri, 06 May 2022 16:25:43 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms Two of the animals were taken near large, rotting logs, and the third was caught in a trap set below the level of the ground in a hollow stump. Pipistrellus subflavus subflavus. Pipistrelle. Four male pipistrelles were collected by A. P. Blair in a natural tunnel in the Garnett ravines. The tunnel was about 4 feet in diameter and penetrated about 30 feet into a limestone bluff. One of the bats was taken on February 22, 1935, and was in hibernation at the time. The others were captured on July 21, 1936. Three bats that were seen flying together at dusk over the oak elm association at Twin Lakes on August 3, 1935, were identified tentatively as pipistrelles on the basis of their small size and peculiar manner of flight. Procyon lotor hirtus Nelson and Goldman. Raccoon. No specimen is available, so the raccoon of the region tentatively has been referred to the race hirtus, which should occur in northeastern Oklahoma according to Nelson and Goldman . The racoon is reported to be common along the streams of the Bird Creek system, where it lives in the larger trees of the oak-elm association. Racoon tracks frequently have been seen by 0. W. Letson in Mohawk Park. In 1933 a family of raccoons that he estimated to be made up of an adult and 4 or 5 young frequented a trail in the park where he often observed their tracks. Raccoon tracks often were observed on the muddy banks of Bird 28, 1938 . Several of these skunks were seen dead on the highway in the grama beardgrass association in the Garnett area. This apparently is a wide-ranging form like many other carnivores, and it probably occurs in most of the ecological associations of the region. Mephitis mephitis mesomelas. Striped skunk. This skunk ranges widely in the region, and individuals have been observed in all of the major associations except the bluejoint switchgrass. One was routed from its den beneath a limestone slab in the grama beardgrass association on the Garnett prairie in October, 1931. It traveled about 400 yards to the nearest ravine and took refuge in a hole at the base of the rim-rock. Another was found beneath a limestone slab in the sumac grama association. Skunk droppings often were seen in the ravine forest association in the Garnett area. Numerous skunks have been observed by 0. W. Letson in the oak-elm association in Mohawk Park, and several skunk dens were found by him. A striped skunk was seen by him at 8:30 in the morning of February 12, 1938. An adult male was found living almost in the center of Tulsa. It was discovered on August 31, 1935, in a length of pipe in a junk yard. Canis lupus nubilus. Wolf. This wolf is reported to be still common in the Osage Savanna, but it probably is extinct in the Bird Creek region. A farmer claimed to have killed a wolf on the Garnett prairie in the spring of 1935, but it probably was a coyote. The name wolf generally is applied to the coyote in the region. Canis latrans subspecies. Coyote. The coyote of the Bird Creek region probably is of the subspecies latrans, although no specimens are available. Coyotes often were observed in the grama-beardgrass association. In the summer of 1936, a coyote regularly followed at dusk the top of a ridge in this association on the Garnett prairie. In a drizzling rain on a day in November, 1932, a coyote was encountered near the crest of a ridge in the sumacgrama association in the Garnett area. The animal was sighted about 40 This content downloaded from 97.84.199.207 on Fri, 06 May 2022 16:25:43 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms yards away as I crossed a ridge, moving up-wind. On November 29, 1931, a coyote, pursued by hounds, was seen at Garnett mingling with a pack of mongrel dogs for a few moments before continuing its flight. The coyote was not recorded from any of the forest associations, but this wide-ranging form probably crosses most of the associations of the region at some time. Vulpes fulva. Red fox. There are no records of the red fox, but it possibly occurs in the region. Urocyon cinereoargenteus subspecies. Gray fox. The gray fox probably occurs in the region, although it has not been recorded. Lynx rufus subspecies. Bob-cat. The bob-cat still is found in the Osage Savanna , but it apparently is extinct in the Bird Creek region. Citellus tridecemlineatus texensis. Thirteen-lined spermophile. The spermophile of the Bird Creek region has been referred to the subspecies texensis by A. H. Howell . This spermophile inhabits the grasslands of the region. The species is not common on the Garnett prairie, but one individual was seen there in the grama beardgrass association on July 30, 1935, and a subadult female was taken there on July 4, 1936. One was seen there on July 5, 1936, in the sumac grama association. Spermophiles often were seen in the bluejointswitchgrass association in the vicinity of Tulsa. The largest population of spermophiles was found on a golf course in Mohawk Park, where 15 specimens were collected on August 3, 1935, and many other individuals were seen. Two half-grown albino females were captured in the same place on August 14, 1935, and a third albino animal was seen. A female spermophile that was captured in Mohawk Park on August 17, 1935, gave birth to 8 young on the following day. One of the females of the litter was measured at the age of 24 hours. The total length was 58 mm.; the tail length 10 mm.; and the length of the right hind foot 6 mm. Several toads and one gopher-frog were found in spermophile burrows in Mohawk Park on August 14, 1935. No spermophiles were found in the burrows from which these animals were taken. Sciurus carolinensis carolinensis. Gray-squirrel. The gray-squirrel and fox-squirrel occur together in all of the forest associations of the region. There is no restriction of the gray-squirrel to lowland forests and the fox-squirrel to upland forests, as occurs in most of the range of the 2 species in the southeastern United States. There seems to be a slight predominance of graysquirrels in the oak elm association and a slightly greater abundance of f oxsquirrels in the oak hickory and ravine forest associations. The occurrence of the 2 species together in almost equal numbers in the Bird Creek region may be due to the restricted extent of the forest associations. abundance, population pressure probably forces individuals of both species into all areas habitable by squirrels, so that no distinction is made between the upland and lowland forest. An adult, male gray-squirrel was shot in the oak elm association in the Garnett area on July 18, 1935. A subadult female was taken at the same station on July 27, 1935. An adult femnale was collected in the ravine forest association in the same region on July 27, 1935, and another was taken at the same station on September 5. Another adult female was taken in the oak hickory association in the same area on July 12, 1935. Gray-squirrels were very numerous in Mohawk Park in the summer of 1936, where they were observed in the oak elm, pin oak swamp, and lowland thicket associations. In June, 1937, these animals were found to be extremely scarce in the region, and few were observed in Mohawk Park, where they had been abundant the previous year. Sciurus niger rufiventer. Fox-squirrel. An adult, male fox-squirrel was collected in the ravine forest association in the Garnett area on July 27, 1935. Another adult male was taken in the oak elm association at the same station on the same date. Fox squirrels also were observed in the oak hickory association at this station. Fox-squirrels living in the ravine forest association were found to have the interesting habit, when pursued, of sometimes hiding beneath the limestone blocks littering the ravine slopes instead of taking refuge in the trees. Fox-squirrels were about as abundant as 'gray-squirrels in Mohawk Park in the summer of 1936, where they were observed in the oak elm, pin oak swamp, and lowland thicket associations. As many as 50 squirrels of the 2 species could be seen in an area of 2 or 3 acres in the early morning. This abundance may have been due in part to the fact that in the park squirrels are protected from hunting. In June, 1937, the fox-squirrels, like the graysquirrels, were so scarce that hardly one could be seen where dozens existed the previous year. The fact that the increase of 1936 and the decrease of 1937 occurred in the 2 species simultaneously seems worthy of note. It would appear from this that whatever may be the factors governing the abundance of squirrels in the region they affect both species simultaneously. Glaucomys volans saturatus. Flying-squirrel. An adult male and female were trapped in a large oak in the oak elm association in Mohawk Park on August 20, 1935. A pregnant female was trapped in the same tree on September 5, 1935. The 4 uterine swellings averaged 30.5 mm. in length. All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms September 5, 1935, and an adult male and female were taken at this the following day. An adult male was trapped in the same association Garnett area on June 8, 1936. An adult female was secured in the blu switchgrass association near Tulsa on August 17, 1935, and another was obtained on September 4. Pocket-gopher mounds were abundant in the sumac grama association on the Garnett prairie in 1933 and 1934. They were seldom seen in the summers of 1935 and 1936, which were periods of extreme drought. It seems probable that the droughts affected the pocket-gophers adversely by killing many plants thus reducing their food supply and by baking the soil so that it retarded the expansion of colonies. The pocket gophers in this region throw up mounds only when the soil is moist, so it seems probable that their burrows are enlarged only at such times. If young were produced during the drought years they probably would have difficulty in starting burrows if forced out of the maternal tunnels. No evidence of more than one individual living in a single system of burrows was found. Eleven pocket-gophers were collected on a golf course in Mohawk Park in August and early September, 1935. They seemed much less reduced in numbers on the golf course, which was watered during the drought seasons, than in other parts of the Bird Creek region. In the winter of 1937-38, 0. W. Letson found pocket-gophers invading the oak elm association in Mohawk Park. These animals are not known to have previously occurred in this association in the Bird Creek region. In the same winter, P. F. Blair, Jr. noted that pocket-gopher mounds were very abundant on the Garnett prairie in contrast to their scarcity there the preceeding 2 years. The rainy year, 1937, probably favored the increase of the pocket-gophers. Perognathus hispidus spilotus. Plains pocket-mouse. This species is most abundant in the sumac-grama association. Three specimens were taken in this association on the Garnett prairie in November, 1933. Eight were taken at the same station in the summer of 1935. In the summer of 1936, one of these pocket-mice was taken in the sumac grama association on the Twin Lakes prairie, and 20 of them were collected in the same association on the Garnett prairie. Six specimens were taken in the grama beardgrass association on the Garnett prairie in the summer of 1936. Two individuals were trapped in the plum thicket association on the Garnett prairie in September, 1936. Numerous pocket-mouse burrows were discovered and excavated on the Garnett prairie . All of the burrows were located at least partially beneath limestone slabs, and it is probable that the availability of these slabs is an important factor in the distribution of the pocket-mouse in the 3 associations in which it was found. This species was notably absent from ridges in the grama beardgrass association on which there were no limestone fragments. Such ridges generally were found to be dominated by buffalo grass , and the lack of heavier cover may have been responsible in part for the absence of the pocket-mice. In the sumac grama association pocket-mice were most often taken in situations where the ground cover was dense but limited to pockets between the abundant limestone fragments. They were not taken in the prairie drains or other parts of the association where the grasses formed a continuous ground cover. Reithrodontomys montanus griseus. Gray harvest-mouse. An adult male was trapped in the sumac grama association on the Garnett prairie on June 9, 1936, and a subadult male was taken on July 22. An adult male was collected in the grama beardgrass association on the Garnett prairie on July 3, 1936, and an immature male was taken the following day. An adult female was found on June 26, 1936, in a nest beneath a small limestone slab in the grama beardgrass association on the Garnett prairie. There were no burrows beneath the slab, except a shallow depression containing a nest of cotton about one and one-half inches in diameter. The cotton probably was collected about an inhabited shack about 50 feet from the nest. Peromyscus maniculatus ozarkiarum Black. Deer-mouse. A male deermouse was taken in the grama beardgrass association on the Garnett prairie on December 30, 1931, and another was collected at the same station on April 2, 1932. Four individualas were captured there in the summer of 1935, and 15 were secured in the summer of 1936. Fifteen deer-mice were taken in the sumac grama association in the Garnett area in the summer of 1935, and 17 were collected there during the summer of 1936. An adult male was taken in the plum thicket association there on September 2, 1936. In these associations deer-mouse burrows often were found beneath limestone slabs. The nests in these situations often were found to be made of the silky fruit of the oblong-leaved milkweed . Deer-mouse burrows also were found beneath clumps of prickly pear . Eleven deer-mice were trapped in the bluejoint switchgrass association near the southern edge of Mohawk Park in December, 1931. Most of the mice were trapped in an area that had been burned a short time before, and in this situation their burrows were easily located. Peromyscus leucopus noveboracensis. Wood-mouse. A female wood-mouse was taken in the ravine forest association in the Garnett area on December 30, 1931. It was trapped near a hole at the base of a large limestone block on a ravine slope. Another was trapped at the same station on April 2, 1932. One wood-mouse was taken in the ravine forest association in the Garnett area on June 20, 1935, and 4 were collected in the same association in the Twin Lakes ravines on July 2, 1935. Thirteen were collected in this association in the Garnett area, and 16 were taken in the Twin Lakes area during the summer of 1936. The wood-mouse was found to occur in all parts of the ravine forest association. Along the rim-rock it was associated with the brushmouse . Seven wood-mice were taken in the oak hickory association in the Garnett area in the summer of 1935. Eleven wood-mice were taken at the same station A male wood-mouse was captured beneath a log in the oak-elm association in the Twin Lakes area on March 4, 1932; a male and female were taken in this association at the mouth of Mingo Creek on March 19, 1932; and a male was collected in the same association near the mouth of Bird Creek on April 1, 1932. Fifteen wood-mice were taken in this association in Mohawk Park during the summer of 1935, and one was taken in it in the Garnett area. One of those taken in Mohawk Park was caught in a trap that was set about 20 feet from the ground in a large bur oak on August 31. Nine specimens were collected in this association in Mohawk Park during the summer of 1936. In the oak elm association the wood-mouse was found to live beneath fallen logs, in brush piles, or in trees. Individuals were most often found living beneath or within the dryer and less decayed logs. Six wood-mice were collected in the sumac-grama association on the Garnett prairie during the summer of 1935. Twenty-two specimens were obtained in the same association on the Garnett prairie in the summer of 1936. Many of the wood-mice taken in this association probably wandered into it from the oak-hickory and ravine forest associations. Some of them may have been living in the association, but no nests of these mice were found there. Fifteen wood-mice were taken in the lowland thicket association in Mohawk Park in August, 1936. Four mice were captured in the sedge marsh association, and 2 males and one female were taken in the buttonbush swamp association in the same region and during the same month. An adult male was trapped in the pin oak swamp association in Mohawk Park on August 19, 1936, and another adult male was caught in the weed association in the same region on August 25. The scarcity of wood-mice in these associations probably was due to the lack of homesites. The animals taken here may have wandered into the areas from the oak elm association. Peromyscus boylii attwateri. Brush-mouse. Four brush-mice were taken at the base of the rim-rock in the ravine forest association in the Twin Lakes area, in the summer of 1935. Seventeen of these mice were trapped at the same station in the summer of 1936. These mice were trapped at the base of the rim-rock and on the steeper ravine slopes. None were taken where there were not large rock outcrops with an abundance of fissures and crevices, and none were taken on the more gentle ravine slopes. The niche occupied by this species and that occupied by the wood-mouse somewhat overlap. The wood-mouse generally was found to live on the more gentle slopes, but it occasionally was taken on the steep slopes with the brush mouse and at the base of the rim-rock. On the rim-rock the brush-mouse is associated with the woodrat . A pair of brush-mice was observed in a woodrat nest near Okesa, Osage County, on August 1, 1936. It is surprising that the brush-mouse was not found in the Garnett ravines, as the conditions there apparently are suitable. Sigmodon hispidus texianus. Cotton-rat. An adult, male cotton-rat was taken in the bluejoint switchgrass association near the southern edge of Mohawk Park on January 17, 1932, where numerous runways were observed. On November 25, 1933, an adult female was trapped in the sumac grama association on the Garnett prairie. On December 29, an adult male was found at the same station beneath a limestone slab. The nuts of the black hickory and pecan and acorns of the blackjack oak were stored beneath the slab. There were 2 well-marked trails leading to entrances to the burrows beneath the stone. The ground about the entrances was littered with weed and grass stems that had been cut into short lengths. In the summer of 1934, cotton-rats were very abundant in the Bird Creek region. In July of that year these animals were found even on the barren ridges of the grama beardgrass association in the Garnett area. In these situations, numerous rats and their nests and runways were observed beneath clumps of prickly pear . At that time the cotton-rat cycle was at a peak, and undoubtedly the pressure exerted by over-population in the habitats normally occupied by the species forced many individuals into less favorable situations. Cotton-rats were so scarce in the summer of 1935 that only one individual was seen during 3 months in the field. This animal was found dead in the road 13 miles east of Tulsa in an area of sumac grama association. In the summer of 1936 cotton-rats again were abundant in the Bird Creek region, although they did not seem as numerous as in 1934 and were not found in the grama beardgrass association. Forty-two specimens were taken in the sumac grama association on the Garnett prairie during June and July. Twelve adult and 28 immature cotton-rats were taken in the sedge marsh association in Mohawk Park from August 11 to 14. Many of the immature animals were so small that they seemed hardly large enough to get around, and others were of various larger sizes. The large proportion of these young cotton-rats of various sizes indicates that the species was breeding in early August in the sedge marsh association. No very young individuals were among the 16 cotton-rats trapped from August 11 to 14 in the weed association in Mohawk Park, and the 3 subadults taken were almost fully grown. Only one subadult was included in the 17 cotton-rats taken from September 2 to 5 in the plum thicket association on the Garnett prairie. It is evident from this that the species was not breeding in August in the weed and plum thicket associations. Throughout the summer there was an abundance of 'green food available in the sedge marsh association in the form of sedge plants. In the associations in which the cotton-rats were not breeding the grasses and other low plants were dead and dry during late summer. It may be possible that green food is necessary for the normal functioning of the reproductive processes of the cotton-rat. The yearly fluctuations in numbers of cotton-rats from 1934 to 1936 correlate with the amount of spring rainfall. The spring of 1934 and that of 1936, preceding summers of cotton-rat abundance, were relatively dry, while that of 1935, preceding a summer of scarcity, was unusually wet. The wet spring possibly affected the cotton-rats adversely by flooding their homes and drowning any young that may have been produced. On February 27, 1932, 2 adult females were collected and other cotton-rats were seen beneath cane \"shocks\" in a field about 2 miles south of Owasso, The house-mouse was abundant in the same habitat. Neotoma floridana baileyi. Florida woodrat. One female and 3 adult, male woodrats were trapped in the ravine forest association in the Garnett ravines on April 16, 1932. Three specimens were taken at the same station in the summer of 1935, and 3 were collected there in the summer of 1936. A subadult male was collected in this association in the Twin Lakes ravines on June 30, 1936. In the ravine forest association woodrats were most often caught near the rim-rock. Their bulky nests of sticks and leaves could be seen in many places in the larger crevices in the rim-rock. The woodrats also were trapped on the ravine slopes near the larger limestone blocks. They occupied burrows beneath the blocks. Five wood-rats were taken in the oak-hickory association in the Garnett area during the summer of 1935. One of these was trapped near the entrance to a burrow under a large limestone slab. All of the woodrats were taken in situations in which there were more and larger limestone fragments than in most of the area. An adult, male woodrat was caught in the sumac-grama association on the Garnett prairie on November 12, 1932. It was trapped in the entrance to burrows beneath a large limestone slab, which was about 300 yards from the nearest part of the ravine forest association. Several fruits of the persimmon were found in and about the burrows. A woodrat was driven from a hole in a dead snag in the oak-elm association about 3 miles west of Catoosa on December 10, 1932. An adult female was shot in a brush pile in the same association near Catoosa by P. F. Blair, Jr. on February 15, 1936. In the summer of 1935, there were abundant signs of a woodrat living in a dead spotted oak standing in the oak elm association in the Garnett area. Microtus ochrogaster. Prairie vole. The only specimen of the prairie vole known from northeastern Oklahoma is an adult female that was taken a small area of bluejoint switchgrass association about one mile east of Garnett on April 2, 1932. The Bird Creek region must be very near the southern limit of the range of this species. Dice Dice concluded that the westward distribution of the species is limited by the drying up of the grassland at some time of the year. This would mean that in the Bird Creek region the species would be limited to the bluejoint switchgrass association, and that west of this region it would occur only in post-climax areas of tall grass. The destruction of much of the bluejoint switchgrass association in northeastern Oklahoma through cultivation and overgrazing has greatly reduced the extent of habitats suitable to this species. Pitymys nemoralis. Pine vole. Pine voles were found in the Bird Creek region only in the oak elm association. In the spring of 1929 or 1930, the number of pine voles increased almost to epidemic proportions. At that time almost every log or bit of fallen wood on the Verdigris River flood-plain opposite the mouth of Bird Creek sheltered one or more of the animals. An adult male was taken in the Twin Lakes area on February 13, 1932, and 2 adult females were taken in the same area on March 4, 1932. Two adult females were taken near the mouth of Mingo Creek on March 18 and 19, 1932. Another was collected near the mouth of Bird Creek on April 1, 1932. A female with 5 very small young was captured beneath a rotting log in the Twin Lakes area on February 15, 1933. The nest was made of grass, leaves, and shredded elm bark. When the female was disturbed she ran from the nest with the young clinging to her teats. This behavior was observed on many occasions when females with young were disturbed. A half-grown male was captured in a nest of grass and leaves beneath a rotting log in the Garnett area on Novembet 18, 1933. The nuts of the bitternut hickory and pecan and the acorns of the spotted oak were found stored in a chamber beneath the log. The pine vole was found to occupy a niche slightly different from that occupied by the wood-mouse . The woodmice were found under the more dry and less decomposed logs. Pine voles were found under rotten, crumbling logs with a high water content. In wet seasons pine voles were found at the Twin Lakes in nests beneath logs only a few feet from temporary ponds. There often was water less than a foot below the surface of the ground beneath the logs. In such situations the \"wells\" of crayfish often were found beneath the logs which covered the pine vole nests. Pine voles sometimes were found in winter living beneath corn \"shocks\" in flood-plain fields surrounded by the oak-elm association. The population of pine voles in the Bird Creek region was almost wiped out by the wet spring of 1935, when flood waters stood on the flood-plains of the region for several weeks. None of these animals were found during the summers of 1935 and 1936, except in Mohawk Park, where the floodplains were protected by a dike. An adult male and female were captured beneath a log in Mohawk Park, by A. P. Blair Zapus hudsonius campestris. Jumping-mouse. An adult, female jumpingmouse was taken in the lowland thicket association in Mohawk Park on August 17, 1936. Four days later an adult male was taken in the same association 170 yards from where the female was caught. The specimens extend the known rantge of the species southward from central Kansas into northeastern Oklahoma. The specimens are somewhat smaller and paler than typical campestris, but the differences are not sufficient to warrant subspecific recognition on the basis of no more material than now is available. Lepus californicus melanotis. Jackrabbit. Jackrabbits were observed many time in the grama beardgrass association on the Garnett prairie. Ore was shot there on November 24, 1932, and another was killed on November 26. Four were shot at the same station on October 1, 1933. A female that was shot on July 22, 1935, in this association on the Garnett prairie contained one large embryo. A jackrabbit that was pursued by dogs at the same station on June 21, 1935, killed itself by running into the bottom strand of a barbed-wire fence and cutting its throat. Jackrabbits were seen also in the sumac grama association in the Garnett area, but they were much less frequently encountered there than in the gramabeardgrass association. They were not seen in the bluejoint switchgrass association except where hay meadows had been mowed. An adult male and suckling female were shot on June 27, 1935, about one mile northeast of Garnett. The 2 animals were moving about together, and they hopped from an oat field across a road into a corn field. The stomach of each was filled with masticated oat grains. Sylvilagus floridanus alacer. Cottontail. Following a heavy snow, 6 cottontails were found beneath tree roots and in other protected spots in the oak-elm association near the mouth of Mingo Creek on December 27, 1932. An adult male was shot by P. F. Blair, Jr. in Seven cottontails were shot in the ravine forest association in the Garnett area on a day in the fall of 1933. Cottontails were observed in the Garnett ravines on numerous other occasions. They often would escape into retreats beneath the limestone blocks on the ravine slopes or into crevices in the rimrock. These animals often were observed in the oak hickory association in the Garnett area, where 5 specimens were taken in September, 1936. The cottontails were most frequently encountered in the parts of the association in which there was heavy cover. Cottontails frequently were observed in the sumac grama association in the Garnett area. A young male was shot there on June 27, 1935, and an adult male was collected there by P. F. Blair, Jr. on November 20, 1935 . Five cottontails were obtained in the same place during the first week of September, 1936. They were found to be rare in the grama-beardgrass association, but 3 specimens were taken in that association in the Garnett area on October 1. 1933. The cover is rather sparse for cottontails in this association. They never were seen on the more barren ridges dominated by buffalo grass . Cottontails frequently were seen in the plum thicket association on the Garnett prairie. They also were often seen in the bluejointswitchgrass association in various parts of the Bird Creek region. A cottontail was seen in the sedge marsh association in Mohawk Park on August 11, 1936. Swamp-rabbits were observed in the same situation. Cottontails were observed on numerous occasions in the buttonbush swamp association in Mohawk Park and in the Twin Lakes area. In the summer of 1936, they frequently were encountered in the weed and lowland thicket associations in Mohawk Park. Sylvilagus aquaticus aquaticus. Swamp-rabbit. Four swamp-rabbits were shot in the oak-elm association about 2 miles northwest of Catoosa on December 10, 1932. There was a 2 inch cover of snow on the ground, and one swamp-rabbit was seen and tracked in the snow. For the first 40 yards after being flushed the rabbit averaged 6 feet at a jump. Then the jumps lengthened to about 12 feet. When the animal crossed a weedy area the jumps shortened to 6 or 8 feet, but as soon as the rabbit left this and entered an area of bare snow the jumps lengthened to 10 and 12 feet. The tracks finally were lost among other rabbit tracks in an extensive thicket. On February 9, 1935, A. P. Blair and P. F. Blair, Jr. frightened a swamp-rabbit from a brush pile at the same station and shot it. An adult female was found dead in the oak-elm association in Mohawk Park on June 22, 1936. An autopsy showed no observable cause of death. A swamp-rabbit was shot in the buttonbush swamp association about miles northwest of Catoosa on November 20, 1932, and another was obtained there on November 25, 1932. Three specimens were collected in the same situation by A. P. Blair and P. F. Blair, Jr. in February, 1936. These animals often were observed in the sedge marsh association in Mohawk Park and on the Bird Creek flood-plain near Catoosa. On August . The summers of 1934, 1935, and 1936 were abnormally dry in the Bird Creek region, as in many parts of the central United States. The average rainfall in this region during the months of June, July, and August is 11.42 inches . There was a total of only 5.54 inches of rainfall during these months in 1934. In these months in 1935 there was a rainfall of 11.82 inches, but approximately 10 inches of this came in the first 20 days of June. In 1936 only 2.87 inches of rain fell during June, July, and August. During the first 8 months of that year the The dry summers of 1934 and 1935 had only moderately severe effects on the vegetation of the region. The most conspicuous results of these dry summers were the absence or scarcity of many late summer and autumn annuals and the failure of fall-fruiting grasses to set seed. The flood-plains of the region were extremely barren in the summer of 1935, as their inundation for several weeks in the spring killed much of the under-cover. The cumulative effects of the droughts of 1934 and 1935 may have intensified the effects of the drought of 1936 through the reduction of moisture in the soil. The great drought of 1936 had a conspicuous effect on the oak-elm association in some parts of the Bird Creek region. Numerous trees of several. species were killed, and the forest floor was opened up to many invading annuals. One of the most severely damaged sections in the Twin Lakes area was examined on June 28, 1937. A census was made of the trees in a strip 165 feet wide along the north shore of the south lake, comprising 1.4 acres . The American elm and hackberry , which were the principal dominants of the area, suffered most from the drought. The American elm was most severely affected, losing 29 of 61 trees on the plot, or 47 per cent of the elm trees. The hackberry was somewhat less severely damaged. Twenty-five of the 76 trees of this species were killed, and 3 suffered some top-killing. The trees completely killed comprise 34 per cent of the individuals of this species in the plot. In all, 15 of the 21 species of trees in the plot suffered some damage from the drought, either through top-killing or through complete loss of life. Thirty per cent of all of the trees in the plot were killed. The loss of so many of the trees allowed sunshine to penetrate to the forest floor. This resulted in the replacement of most of the shade tolerant herbs by annual weeds, of which the most conspicuous was the high-water weed . Among the undershrubs in the plot, many of the roughleaf dogwood , swamp holly , pricklyash , and prairie rose were killed to the ground. On the other hand, the coral berry , hawthorn , and blackhaw apparently did not suffer. The above described plot is an extreme example of the effects of the drought on the oak--elm association in the Bird Creek region. Most of the trees killed were within 80 feet of the lake shore, and they probably had shorter roots than those farther from the lake. Trees also were killed in other parts of the association, but not in such great numbers. The oak-hickory association did not suffer as severely as did normally moist situations in the oak-elm association, like that described above. However, trees were killed in many places in the oak-hickory association, and numerous other trees that were not killed suffered top-killing or the loss of large limbs. There also was in this association a heavy loss in the shrub layer, where the smooth and dwarf sumacs were stripped of their leaves and bark by grasshoppers. The grasshoppers destroyed these plants apparently because other food was scarce, due to the drought. The drought resulted in a general opening up of the forest in some parts of this association and in restricting the extent of the association where it was encroaching on adjoining grasslands. The effects of the drought on the grassland associations of the region were less conspicuous and apparently less severe than on the forest associations. The tall grasses achieved very little growth during 1936, and most of them failed to set seed. There may have been some decrease of tall grasses and increase in short grasses in the grama-beardgrass association similar to that found by Weaver and Albertson in Kansas and Nebraska, but no detailed study of the composition of the grassland vegetation was made. There were no changes sufficiently great to alter the general aspect of any of the grassland associations, and following the wet spring of 1937, these associations looked very much like they did before the drought years. This content downloaded from 97.84.199.207 on Fri, 06 May 2022 16:25:43 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms The most conspicuous effects of the great drought of 1936 in the Bird Creek region were the death of many trees of the dominant species in the oak-elm association, particularly in normally moist situations, and the death of numerous trees in the oak-hickory association, thereby reducing the density and extent of that association. Undoubtedly the changes in the vegetation caused by the drought resulted in changes in the local distribution and abundance of some of the mammals in the region, but information about any such changes that may have taken place is not available. In order to obtain a measure of the abundance of small mammals in the various associations of the region, most of the traps employed during the summer of 1936 were set in measured quadrats or in single lines of measured length. A quadrat 4 by 5 chains in dimensions was found to be a convenient unit and was employed in most situations where the extent of the association was sufficient to permit its use. Where an association was too small to allow the use of a quadrat of this size smaller quadrats were employed. The large quadrats contained 5 parallel lines of traps, the trap lines being one chain apart and 5 chains long. Each trap line consisted of 20 traps spaced about 16 feet apart. The close spacing of the traps made sure that most of the mammals would be trapped out of the area in a short period of time. In the smaller quadrats the trap lines generally were also placed one chain apart, and the spacing of the traps was the same as in tlhe large quadrats. The lines were laid out with a steel tape, and a compass was used in heavy cover. Small cloth banners, placed on stakes at intervals of one chain along the lines, facilitated the laying out of the quadrats. The single trap lines generally were 25 chains in length. A line of this length contained 100 traps spaced about 16 feet apart. A trap line about 12 chains long containinlg 50 traps, and another about 6 chains long containing 25 traps also were employed at various times. The measured trap lines are more easily set than the quadrats and can be placed in parts of ecological associations which are of such shapes that quadrats can not easily be laid out. Small, metal, live traps of several types were used except in 2 of the quadrats where snap traps were employed. The snap traps were of the \"Museum Special\" type. All of the traps were numbered serially. Both the live and snap traps apparently functioned equally well. The number of the trap in which each animal was taken was recorded together with the sex and approximate age class of the animal. All of the mammals caught were removed from the area. Each quadrat or single trap line ordinarily was maintained for 4 nights of trapping, although in a few cases the period of trapping was longer. In order that the calculations of relative abundance in the various associations may be comparable only the catch of the first 4 nights will be considered. This content downloaded from 97.84.199.207 on Fri, 06 May 2022 16:25:43 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms The animals taken in an area during the first 4 nights of trapping, how do not necessarily comprise the actual population of the area over whic traps have been set. It is probable that not all of the animals whose home ranges are crossed by the trap lines are captured in this period of time, although W. H. Burt has found that, in areas in southern Michigan in which he knew the population of wood mice, 90 to 95 per cent of the population could be taken in 4 nights of trapping. Some of the individuals taken on a quadrat have home ranges that extend beyond the limits of the outer traps, and therefore the area trapped out is larger than the area on which the traps are set. Another complicating factor is the possibility that some animals will wander into the area from unknown distances after the resident animals have been trapped. This method of trapping does, however, give an index of relative abundance that is free of the most serious of Dice's criticisms of the \"trap-night\" method of Grinnell . The use of standard time, areal, and trapping units makes quadrats set at approximately the same time of the year comparable. The even spacing of the traps reduces the probability of error due to the personal factor involving skill and experience in setting traps. The method is more reliable than that of Townsend in which the areal units were so small that in wandering from adjacent areas, for which no allowance was made, obviously contributed more to the size of the catch than the population within the measured area. The trapping records detailed below give, for the summer of 1936, a measure of the relative abundance of a few of the species of the region in the several associations in which they were found. Several other species of mammals were taken in the quadrats and trap lines, but so few individuals were obtained that little more can be said of these species than that they were rare in the Bird Creek region in the summer of 1936. Peromyscus maniculatus ozarkiarum. Deer-mice were taken in 2 quadrats in the grama-beardgrass association and in 4 quadrats in the sumac grama association. The number of mice taken per quadrat in one of these associations is comparable with the catch per quadrat in the other. This is true because the quadrats were of the same size ; they were set at approximately the same time of the year ; and each quadrat was located in the midst of a large, uniform area, making the chances of inwandering the same in each quadrat. Ten deer-mice were taken from June 24 to 27 in one quadrat in the grama-beardgrass association, and 5 were caught in the other from July 3 to 6. The 4 quadrats run in the sumac-grama association in June and July took 6, 4, 3, and 3 deer-mice respectively. This suggests that deer-mice were more abundant in the grama-beardgrass than in the sumac-grama association in the summer of 1936. Perognatbus hispidus maximus. Pocket-mice were taken in all of the quadrats in which the deer-mice were caught, and the catch of pocket-mice in the 2 associations can also be directly compared. Three pocket-mice were captured in one of the 2 quadrats in the grama-beardgrass association, and one indiivdual was taken in the other. The 4 quadrats in the sumac grama association took 7, 6, 5, and 2 pocket-mice respectively. This seems t indicate that these mice were more abundant in the sumac-grama than in grama-beardgrass association. Peromyscus leucopus noveboracensis. The numbers of wood-mice tak per quadrat in the various associations are not comparable, because qua and single lines of various sizes were necessitated by the variations in the and shape of the areas covered by many of the associations. However, abundance of wood-mice in the various associations may be compared if average catch of these animals per acre in each can be calculated. The reliability of these calculations depends on the accuracy with which the area trapped out can be computed. The home ranges of some of the mice taken will lie partially outside of the measured area, and an allowance for this must be made in the calculation of the area trapped out. W. H. Burt has found that the average width of the home range of the wood-mouse in southern Michigan is about 250 feet. If we assume that the home range of the wood-mouse is the same in the Bird Creek region as in southern Michigan, 125 feet may be added to each side of each quadrat or single line, except on the sides bounded by unfavorable habitats. The chief difficulty in determining the average catch per acre lies in the impossibility of distinguishing between animals whose home ranges are at least partially within the measured area and those that wander in after the residents have been removed. The computed numbers per acre are not strictly comparable because of this inability to distinguish between resident and invading individuals and because there are less chances of invasion in partially or completely isolated quadrats than in quadrats set in the midst of extensive associations. However, the error from this source is believed not to be great enough to obscure the larger differences in numbers of wood-mice in the various associations, and the computed number per acre probably is a rough approximation of the population per acre. The greatest concentration of wood-mice was in the ravine forest association, where the computed catch per acre was 2.01 animals . The TABLE 2 Computed catch of wood-mice in the Bird Creek region.

Wood-mice occasionally were found in the sumac-grama association on the Garnett prairie, as stated in the annotated list. In the summer of 1936, one individual was taken in a quadrat in this association on June 26, and 2 others were taken on July 21 and 23, respectively. These animals probably were wanderers from the adjoining oak-hickory and ravine forest associations. A quadrat in the sumac-grama association had one of its long sides parallel to the edge of the oak-hickory association which was about 100 yards away. Nineteen wood-mice were taken in this quadrat from June 6 to 10. All of the mice appeared to be young of the year, although some had attained adult pelage. Young wood-mice were found by Burt to wander more than old animals and to push out from their preferred habitats into unfavorable situations during their search for homesites. The wood-mice taken in this quadrat probably were wanderers from the nearby oak-hickory association. Wood mice were taken rarely later in the summer in the quadrats in the sumac-grama association, probably because young mice were not being produced then. Sigmodon hispidus texianus. The problem of comparing the numbers of cotton-rats taken in the various associations is more difficult than that of comparing the numbers of wood-mice. The average size of the home range of the cotton-rat is not known, so in the computation of the average catch per acre an arbitrary addition of one chain has been made beyond the outermost traps on each side of the quadrat on which there was a habitat occupied by cotton-rats. The allowance of one chain is based on a general knowledge of the habits of the species, which indicates a smaller home range than that of the wood-mouse. The computed number of cotton-rats per acre is much greater for the sedge marsh association than for the other associations in which they were taken . All of the cotton-rats taken in this association apparently were residents, as the area trapped was isolated. It was surrounded by the pin oak swamp association, in which cotton-rats were not taken. The computed catch per acre is greater in the plum thicket association , weed association , and sumac-grama association than in the oak-elm, lowland thicket, and buttonbush swamp associations. In these latter associations so few cotton-rats were taken that it can only be said that the species was scarce in these habitats. The relative abundance or scarcity of cotton-rats in the various associations is correlated in a general way with the amount of ground cover available. The heaviest ground cover was present in the sedge marsh association, where the computed catch per acre was greatest. Less cover was available in the weed, plum thicket, and sumac-grama associations, where the computed catch per acre was much less than in the sedge marsh association. Very little ground cover was present in the oak-elm and lowland thicket associations because of the shading of the forest floor by the shrub layer, and cotton-rats were scarce in these associations. They also were scarce in the buttonbush swamp association, where there was little ground cover, because the buttonbushes shaded the ground. It is not known whether the ground cover is more important as protection to the cotton-rats or as a source of food, but it probably is important as both. The population studies presented above, while obviously subject to a considerable degree of error, give a more reliable measure of mammalian abundance than any other method in use at present, except the marking and retrapping of live animals on measured plots, a technique that is not practicable in reconnaissance work. The data obtained through the above studies give a usable measure of the abundance of a species in the various ecological associations in which it occurs. The Bird Creek region is intermediate in position between the eastern deciduous forest and the grasslands of the Great Plains, and it is part of an area about 100 miles wide which is neither predominantly forest nor grassland. This strip in northern Oklahoma liest west of the Ozark biotic district which is a part of the eastern deciduous forest. West of this strip -lies the Mixed-grass Plains district of the Great Plains grasslands. The Bird Creek region is located approximately midway between the western border of the Ozark district and the eastern border of the Mixed-grass Plains district. Ecological associations of both the eastern deciduous forest and the Great 'Plains grasslands occur in the Bird Creek region. The oak-elm, ravine forest, and oak-hickory associations are related to certain eastern deciduous forest associations, as represented in the Ozark district . 'The Great Plains grasslands are represented in the Bird Creek region by the grama-beardgrass and plum thicket associations, which resemble typical associations of the Mixed-grass Plains district. The bluejoint-switchgrass association is closely related to the typical association of the tall-grass prairies, as represented in Illinois and Indiana . Limestone soil that is thinner than that occupied by the oakhickory association becomes very dry in summer and is occupied by the gramabeardgrass association, which is related to the semi-arid grasslands of the Great Plains. Shale soil in the Bird Creek region is occupied by the bluejointswitchgrass association. Since the oak-hickory association constitutes the climax in the Bird Creek region the oak-elm and ravine forest associations represent post-climaxes , and the bluejoint-switchgrass and grama-beardgrass are sub-climax associations. As a result of the edaphic control of the occurrence of the various ecological associations in the Bird Creek region, there is here an interdigitation of the associations representing the eastern deciduous forest with those of the tall-grass prairies and with those of the Great Plains grasslands. These associations maintain their individual characteristics in the Bird Creek region, therefore ecological associations of the eastern deciduous forest, of the Great Plains grasslands, and of the tall-grass prairies here exist side by side. Periods of drought, like that extending through the summer of 1936, and probably also prairie fires aid in maintaining the above described relationships of the ecological associations in the Bird Creek region. The droughts prevent the forest from occupying the grasslands by killing numerous trees in the forest associations, thereby reducing the extent and density of these associations.

However, it is theoretically to the eastern deciduous forest, since the oak-hickory association, here encroaching slightly on the grassland associations, is considere regional climax. It seems doubtful, however, that under the present conditions the oak-hickory association would ever replace the grassl ciations. Severe droughts, to which the region occasionally is subjected the spread of forest associations by killing the trees, and the constan wind velocity probably reduces, through evaporation, the amount of available for plant growth to much less than the average annual rainf seem to indicate. Four of these species, the opossum , gray-squirrel , fox-squirrel , and flying-squirrel , are semi-arboreal. The pipistrelle is a cave-inhabiting form, which probably is largely limited by the absence o caves from the eastern Great Plains. Two non-arboreal species, the Carolin shrew and pine vole , are confined almost entirely to the mesic floor of the oak-elm association. The little shrew occurs in the sumac-grama association in the Bird Creek region, and it commonly occurs also in grassy fields throughout its range Therefore, it seems probable that some factor other than the absence of forest associations limits its western distribution. The mole extends out into the Great Plains along the streams farther than does the lowland forest. Soil that can be worked easily is an essential factor in the distribution of this species, and east-west stream valleys are highways by which the species extends out into the Great Plains. In western Oklahoma this species is abundant in the sand dunes adjoining the larger streams, where the characteristic plants are sand-inhabiting species with western affinities. The wood-mouse in the Bird Creek region occurs occasionally in the sumac-grama association, but it otherwise is confined to the forest associations. The species extends westward with the oak-elm association along the flood-plains of the streams. However, it extends beyond the western limits of this association and inhabits brushy situations in the grasslands of western Oklahoma. West of the Great Plains the species occurs in brush and forest associations. The Florida woodrat in the southeastern states is more arboreai than in the western part of its range. In the Bird Creek region the species occasionally nests in trees, although it most frequently is associated with rock outcrops. The woodrat extends westward along the stream valleys, and in Oklahoma it apparently does not extend beyond the western limits of eastern deciduous forest associations. In western Kansas the species is in part saxicolous and is said also to live on the open, grassy plains. The Florida cottontail is abundant in the Bird Creek region in the several forest associations and in the sumac-grama association, which is intermediate between the deciduous forest associations and those of the Great Plains grasslands. It also occurs occasionally in the Great Plains grassland associations. The species is distributed westward along the stream valleys and extends beyond the western limits of the eastern deciduous forest associations. In western Oklahoma it is abundant in the sand dunes adjoining the larger streams. The 3 Gulf coastal plain species in the Bird Creek region are a pocketgopher , a cotton-rat , and the swamp rabbit . The pocket-gopher occurs in the Bird Creek region in grassland associations and in the oak-elm association. Soil sufficiently deep for burrowing is an important factor in the distribution of this species. Its westward distribution follows along the stream valleys, for in western Oklahoma it is largely confined to them. In northeastern Oklahoma the species approaches the northern limits of its known range. The cotton-rat occurs in the Bird Creek region in all of the ecological associations having a fairly heavy ground cover, and in times of great abundance it moves out into the arid grassland type of association. The species probably extends westward in the stream valleys, but the extent of its western This content downloaded from 97.84.199.207 on Fri, 06 May 2022 16:25:43 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms distribution is not known. It approaches the northern limits of its known range in northeastern Oklahoma. The swamp-rabbit enters the Bird Creek region through the valley of the Arkansas River. In the Bird Creek region this species is confined to forest associations of the flood-plain, and so far as known it occurs in no other associations in northeastern Oklahoma. The species extends westward along the streams at least to the western edge of the Osage Savanna biotic district. It reaches the northern limit of its range in southeastern Kansas. None of the Gulf coastal plain species found in the Bird Creek region are limited in their northern distribution by any observable physical barrier, and the northern limits of none of them coincide with any marked change in the vegetation or physical environment. The only species in the Bird Creek region that hlas the tall-grass prairies as its area of greatest abundance is the prairie vole . It occurs in the bluejoint-switchgrass association in the Bird Creek region, and apparently approaches the southwestern limits of its range there. It probably does not extend westward beyond the limits of the tall-grass prairie type of association, and its southern limit possibly is determined by the maximum summer temperature, as stated in the annotated list. The 4 species in the Bird Creek region having the Great Plains grasslands as their area of greatest abundance are the prairie spotted skunk , thirteen-lined spermophile , plains pocket-mouse , and gray harvest-mouse . All of these species range widely northward and southward in the Great Plains. The pocket-mouse and harvest-mouse are confined in the Bird Creek region to the grama-beardgrass, plum thicket, and sumacgrama associations and apparently reach their eastern limits at the eastern limits of the ecological associations representative of the Mixed-grass Plains biotic district. Thle prairie spotted skunk, which occurs in the Bird Creek region in both grassland and forest associations, extends northeastward for some distance into the tall-grass prairies, but so far as known it does not cross the Mississippi River. The thirteen-lined spermophile, which ranges over most of the Great Plains grasslands and which in the Bird Creek region occurs in both mixed-grass and tall-grass associations, extends eastward in the tallgrass prairies to northern Ohio. Three species that are widely distributed in western North America occur in the Bird Creek region, into which they range from the Great Plains grasslands. These species are the coyote , deer-mouse , and black-tailed jackrabbit . The coyote is known to occur in the grama-beardgrass and sumac-grama associations in the Bird Creek region. It ranges eastward in the tall-grass prairies, but so far as known it does not occur in forest associations in eastern Oklahoma. The deer-mouse is widely distributed in the Great Plains grasslands. In the Bird Creek region it occurs in both the mixed-grass and tall-grass type of associations. The species extends eastward in the tall-grass prairies and also inhabits the northern part of the eastern deciduous forest and the forests of the Appalachian Mountains. It does not extend eastward from the Great Plains grasslands into the ecological associations of the central and southern parts of the eastern deciduous forest. The jackrabbit reaches its eastern limit at approximately the eastern limits of the mixed-grass type of associations. It does not occur in the ecological associations of the tall-grass prairies nor in those of the eastern deciduous forest. However, the destruction of these associations in large areas and their replacement by cultivated fields or barren pasture land have permitted the jackrabbit to extend its range some distance eastward in historic time. One species of which the area of -greatest abundance is boreal North America occurs in the Bird Creek region. This is the jumping-mouse , which is at approximately the southern limit of its known range. The species extends southward along the Atlantic coast to Raleigh, North Carolina, but there are no known records of the jumping-mouse from the states intervening between North Carolina and Oklahoma. The jumpingmouse occupies brushy situations along streams in the northern Great Plains, and the species probably extends along north-south stream valleys into the Bird Creek region, where it is recorded from the lowland thicket association. A possible course would be by way of the Missouri, Osage, and Grand river systems. One species that has as its area of greatest abundance the desert mountain ranges of southwestern North America occurs in the Bird Creek region. This is the brush-mouse , which occupies brushy and rocky habitats in many parts of Mexico and the southwestern United States. Wooded and rock-bordered stream valleys that cross the Great Plains grasslands probably are highways for the eastward distribution of this species. The brush-mouse, which is confined to the ravine forest association in the Bird Creek region, extends eastward into the Ozark biotic district of southwestern Missouri and northwestern Arkansas, where it occupies an association similar to the one to which it is confined in the Bird Creek region. The red bat and the big brow are inhabitants of forest associations. For this reas much of the Great Plains, although they occur both east and west of the plains. The striped skunk in the Bird Creek region ranges over most of the associations, as it does in most other regions in which it occurs. The species is not restricted to any particular type of ecological associations, possibly because of its specialized organs of defense, which make it more or less independent of the physical and vegetational features of the environment for protection. The raccoon , mink , and muskrat are inhabitants of the aquatic and littoral associations and range along streams into many biotic areas of North This content downloaded from 97.84.199.207 on Fri, 06 May 2022 16:25:43 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms America. The most important factor in the distribution of these form ently is the presence of water, and if water is present they are tolerant of many kinds of environments. All range across the Great Plains along the streams and are widely distributed along streams both east and west of the plains. The several species of mammals in the Bird Creek region have various areas of greatest abundance, but the most important are the eastern deciduous forest, the Gulf coastal plain, and the Great Plains grasslands. Several species of wide distribution in western North America occur in the region and form with the Great Plains grassland mammals an important element of grassland species. Others range over most of North America and occur in many biotic areas. The northern limits of Gulf coastal plain species that occur in the Bird Creek region and the southern limits of boreal and tall-grass prairie species that are present there are not correlated with any noticeable change in the physical environment. A species tends to occupy, in the Bird Creek region, ecological associations similar to those it occupies in its area of greatest abundance. Seven of the 12 eastern deciduous forest species in the Bird Creek region are confined to forest associations, and one of the Gulf coastal plain species also is confined to forest associations. Four Great Plains grassland species and 3 species of wide distribution in western North America are confined in the Bird Creek region to Great Plains grassland associations. The one tall-grass prairie species in the Bird Creek region is recorded in the region only from a tall-grass prairie association. The southwestern species in the Bird Creek region is confined to the ravine forest association, and the species of which the area of greatest abundance is boreal North America is only recorded from the lowland thicket association. While there is a tendency, as shown above, for most species in the ecotone between the eastern deciduous forest and the Great Plains grasslands to be restricted to associations similar to those they occupy in their respective areas of greatest abundanlce, some, in this transition area, spread out into other types of associations. Four of the eastern deciduous forest species in the Bird Creek region, though most abundant in forest associations, occur here occasionally in grassland associations, and one species has been recorded in the region only from a grassland association. Three of the species in the Bird Creek region that either are widely distributed in western North America or have the Great Plains grasslands as their area of greatest abundance occur here in the tallgrass prairie type of association, and another species occurs also in forest associations. One of the Gulf coastal plain species in the Bird Creek region occurs here in grassland associations, although it is most abundant in the forest associations, and another occurs in the region principally in grassland associations, although it is present also in forest associations.

Four of the eastern deciduous forest species and one of the Gulf coastal plain species of the Bird Creek region extend westward into the Great Plains grasslands. Two Great Plains grassland species and 2 species of wide distribution in western North America that occur in the Bird Creek region extend northeastward into the tall-grass prairies. There is a tendency for most of the species to be changed into other races as they extend into areas where they occupy habitats different from those they inhabit in their respective areas of greatest abundance. The 4 eastern deciduous forest species that extend westward into the Great Plains grasslands are represented there by distinct races. The mole of western Oklahoma is paler than the races that occur in the eastern deciduous forest and constitutes the race Scalopus aquaticus intermedius. The mole of the Bird Creek region is intermediate in color between the moles of the eastern deciduous forest and the western race, although it is referable to the latter. The wood-mouse of the Bird Creek region is of the race Peromyscus leucopus noveboracensis, which occupies much of the northern half of the eastern deciduous forest. In the Mixed-grass Plains district this race is replaced by the paler colored race texanus. The Florida woodrat of the Bird Creek region is of the race Neotoma floridana baileyi, which is characteristic of the broad ecotone between the eastern deciduous forest and the Great Plains grasslands. This race mostly is associated with rock outcrops along the edges of the stream valleys, although it also occurs away from rocks in the flood-plain forest. To the east it intergrades with the races rubida and illinoensis, which occupy the lowlands of the lower and middle Mississippi Valley. In western Kansas baileyi supposedly intergrades with the pale-colored race campestris, which inhabits there the Great Plains grasslands. In western Oklahoma the Great Plains grasslands are occupied by Neotoma micropus, which belongs to the same species group. The cottontail of the Bird Creek region is of the race Sylvilagus floridanus alacer, which centers in the Ozark district. It is replaced in western Oklahoma by the paler racer llanensis . The one Gulf coastal plain species in the Bird Creek region that extends westward beyond the limit of forest associations is the pocket-gopher . It is represented in the Bird Creek region by the race breviceps, which occurs in alluvial soil in Louisiana and eastern Texas and Oklahoma. In central Oklahoma and Texas it intergrades with the paler colored race llanensis, which inhabits stream valleys in western Oklahoma and northwestern Texas. One Great Plains grassland species and 2 species of wide distribution in western North America that enter the Bird Creek region from the Great Plains grasslands are represented in the tall-grass prairies by distinct races. The thirteen-lined spermophile of the Bird Creek region is of the race Citellus tridecemlineatus texensis, which ranges over the Mixed-grass Plains district.

The coyote of the Great Plains grasslands in Ok is of the race Canis latrans nebrascensis according to Jackson and W . This is replaced in the tall-grass prairies by the race latrans. The deer-mouse of the Bird Creek region is closely related to the race Peromyscus maniculatus ozarkiarum, of the southern Ozarks, and to bairdii of the tall-grass prairies, but it is best referred to the former race. It intergrades gradually westward with a paler colored form that resembles the race nebrascensis of western Kansas and Nebraska. Two species of the Bird Creek region that are widely distributed in North America are represented by distinct races in the tall-grass prairies and in the Great Plains grasslands. One of these species, the striped skunk , also is represented in the nearby eastern deciduous forest by a distinct race. The striped skunk of the Bird Creek region is referable to this race, mesomelas, which ranges through Louisiana and Arkansas and westward through the eastern half of Oklahoma and Texas. It apparently intergrades in western Oklahoma with the race varians of the Great Plains grasslands. Northeastward, it intergrades with the race avia of the tall-grass prairies . The other widely distributed species is the muskrat , which is represented in the Bird Creek region by the race cinnamomina. This race is widely distributed in the Great Plains and intergrades with the race zibethica at the approximate border between the Great Plains grasslands and the tall-grass prairies . From the discussion above, it is evident that there is a tendency for a species to become modified as it extends beyond the types of habitats that it occupies in its area of 'greatest abundance.

Eight cebid species in six genera are definitely known to occur in the Yavarí-Ucayali interfluve. Subfamily Aotinae Elliot, 1913 Night monkeys comprise eight currently recognized species in a single genus that ranges from Panama to northern Argentina . Seldom seen by day, and hard to see at night due to their weak eyeshine, night monkeys are more frequently detected by their distinctive vocalizations. Unfortunately, the taxonomy of night monkeys has never been comprehensively revised, and many questions of identification remain. In the absence of reliable criteria for field identification, night monkey identifications are usually justified by making assumptions about geographic range limits. Our attempt to identify collected specimens of night monkeys from the Yavarí-Ucayali interfluve, however, suggests that the current taxonomy is itself based on inadequately documented distributional assumptions. Aotus nancymaae Hershkovitz, 1983 VOUCHER MATERIAL : Marupa , Nuevo San Juan , Orosa , Quebrada Esperanza . UNVOUCHERED RECORDS: Actiamë , Choncó , Divisor , Jenaro Herrera , Reserva Comunal Tamshiyacu-Tahuayo , Río Cochiquinas , Río Orosa , Río Tahuayo , Río Tapiche , Río Yavarí , Río Yavarí-Mirím , Tapiche . IDENTIFICATION: Night monkeys exhibit a limited range of phenotypic variation, mostly in pelage traits, and all of the named forms in this genus were once considered to belong to a single geographically variable species, Aotus trivirgatus . However, subsequent karyotypic research by R.A. Brumback and N.S.F. Ma revealed unexpected geographic variation in diploid numbers and fundamental numbers that they interpreted as evidence for multiple species. The hypothesis that at least some night monkey karyomorphs represent valid taxa is supported by a variety of data, including correlated pelage traits, comparative serology, and clinical responses to experimental infection with malaria parasites ; evidence of sympatry without apparent hybridization in the wild ; substantial mtDNA sequence divergence ; and reduced fertility in at least some hybrid pairings . Together, these and other results effectively refute earlier notions that Aotus is monotypic, but many taxonomic issues remain unresolved. The most frequently cited phenotypic character in the recent literature on Aotus concerns the coloration of the fur of the neck. The so-called ''red-necked'' and ''graynecked'' phenotypes are defined by the presence or absence, respectively, of a lateral extension of the reddish ventral coloration along the neck below and behind the ear . Allegedly, the gray-necked forms of Aotus occur north of the Amazon, and red-necked forms occur south of the Amazon, but Hershkovitz discussed some exceptions to this geographic pattern and others are indicated by specimens that we examined . Although neck coloration is commonly used as the basis for recognizing species groups of Aotus , recent sequencing studies do not support the reciprocal monophyly of gray-necked and red-necked night monkeys . The original description of Aotus nancymaae was largely justified on the basis of karyotypic data, but no morphological voucher material of known geographic origin is apparently available for any chromosomal preparation attributed to this species, and existing vouchers of karyotyped laboratory animals do not consistently exhibit diagnostic pelage traits. 7 Instead, only indirect evidence is available to correlate chromosomes with phenotypes. According to Hershkovitz , unvouchered night monkey karyotypes prepared by N.S.F. Ma from blood samples obtained at Peruvian localities on the south bank of the Amazon all have 54 chromosomes and 72 autosomal arms , whereas most karyotypes from the north bank of the Peruvian Amazon have 2n 5 46 and FN 5 60. Hershkovitz attributed divergent pelage traits to these karyotypes by examining skins from north-bank and south-bank Peruvian localities. He identified the north-bank 2n 5 46 karyotype as belonging to the gray-necked species Aotus vociferans , and he described a new species of red-necked night monkey, A. nancymaae for the southbank 2n 5 54 karyotype. However, an allegedly unique enclave of red-necked night monkeys with 2n 5 54 chromosomes occurs along the lower Río Tigre, a north-bank tributary of the Amazon . 7 Of the two karyotypic vouchers of Aotus nancymaae mentioned by Hershkovitz, one is unambiguously red necked, but the other appears to be gray necked. Although Hershkovitz said that these specimens were from ''the series described by Brumback et al. ,'' the FMNH mammal catalog states they originated from the Johns Hopkins Hospital Primate Colony, whereas Brumback et al.'s material came from other institutions. Instead, FMNH 123032 and 123033 are probably two of the three Johns Hopkins specimens karyotyped by Brumback , who said they were collected in ''the Leticia, Colombia-Iquitos, Peru area of the Amazon Basin south [sic] of the Andes mountains'' .

Reports of C. melanurus from Ecuador and Colombia were based on misidentified material of C. ichillus and C. pruinosus, respectively . Specimens examined: See Voss et al. Remarks: The best available descriptions of this species are in Waterhouse , Goodwin , and Emmons and Feer ; cranial photographs are in Goodwin ; and measurement data are provided in table 6. This is the only species of Coendou with dorsal pelage composed of long, uniformly soft, black fur; short bicolored quills; and a well-developed bony ridge on the roof of the external auditory meatus. By comparison, the black fur of Coendou melanurus-another species with short bicolored quills-is abundantly streaked with yellowish or whitish guard hairs : fig. 67 ), and the blackish fur of C. vestitus is not uniformly soft because it is intermingled with the wiry tips of long bristlequills . Some populations of C. spinosus have predominantly blackish fur, but the pelage of that species is frosted with yellow or orange because the individual hairs have pale tips; C. spinosus also differs from C. mexicanus by having tricolored quills a Tabulated statistics include the sample mean plus or minus one standard deviation , the observed range , and the sample size. b AMNH 72450, 72452, 72454, 72455, 74677, 76196, 76197, 143969, 145983, 190417, 190419, 190421-190427 . c BMNH 3.3.3.94 , 4.7.6.6; USNM 324113-324115, 396587, 520770, 539938 . over its head and forequarters, and it has a smooth-roofed external auditory meatus. Coendou quichua , the only other species of porcupine that occurs in Central America, differs from C. mexicanus by lacking emergent fur and by having tricolored quills scattered throughout its dorsal pelage. The contrasting external features of C. mexicanus and C. quichua are clearly illustrated in Reid . Coendou mexicanus is geographically variable. Throughout its range, highland specimens usually have longer and denser fur than lowland specimens, and some populations differ in size and qualitative cranial traits. Panamanian specimens , for example, have less inflated frontal sinuses than Mexican specimens, and also have much shorter tails, smaller hind feet, and narrower nasal apertures . A careful study of geographic variation in these characters would be welcome, as would complementary phylogeographic analyses of mtDNA sequence variation within this widespread species.

{"text": "Francisco Tenampa\" . Both specimens are still preserved in the Zoological Museum of the University of Copenhagen . At the moment, there seems to be no reason to designate a lectoype for this nominal taxon, nor to designate a neotype for Hystrix mexicana. In addition to the junior synonyms listed above, the unavailable epithet \"novae-hispaniae\" was used for this species by Waterhouse and other 19th-century authors . Specimens examined : Belize, Cayo District, 2 miles from Georgeville . Costa Rica-Cartago, Irazú , Paso Ancho ; Limón, \"Río Teribe\" ; Puntarenas, Barranca ; San José, Cerro de la Muerte , Escazu .

Honduras-Atlántida, Tela ; Francisco Morazán, Tegucigalpa bank of the Amazon to Marajó Island in the Brazilian states of Amazonas and Pará . Interviews with indigenous hunters suggest that the range of this species also extends into the adjacent Atlantic coastal watershed of Maranhão . Remarks: The authorship of this species has often been misattributed; see Voss and Angermann for nomenclatural details. Olfers' original Latin description of Coendou nycthemera is virtually useless, but detailed morphological descriptions were provided by Handley and Pine , Emmons and Feer , and Voss and Angermann . This species has historically been confused with C. bicolor, a substantially larger western Amazonian species. Specimens examined: See Voss and Angermann . ley, 1976; Husson, 1978) and southward throughout most of the forested cis-Andean lowlands of Ecuador, Peru, and Brazil to eastern Bolivia , northwestern Argentina , and eastern Paraguay . It seems probable that C. prehensilis also occurs in western Paraguay, but no specimens or sightings have apparently been reported from the region. Remarks: Because it was originally based on vernacular descriptions of several different species, Linnaeus's concept of Hystrix prehensilis was composite. Nineteenth-century usage followed Kerr , who restricted the application of this name to the eastern Brazilian porcupine described by Marcgraf . Thomas recommended that the type locality should be construed as Pernambuco, where Marcgraf principally resided while he was in Brazil. Because Thomas's recommendation was not nomenclaturally binding, however, and because the porcupines currently referred to Coendou prehensilis may comprise more than one valid taxon, Leite et al. appropriately designated a neotype. 3 The best descriptions of this species are in Husson and Leite et al. , both of whom illustrate its distinctive external and craniodental morphology. This is a large, long-tailed porcupine, adult specimens of which appear to be completely spiny because they lack emergent fur; the longest dorsal quills of most specimens are tricolored , even over the rump; the frontal sinuses of adults and subadults are always inflated; the nasal aperture is very wide; and the upper incisors are distinctly procumbent. As remarked by Leite et al. , Coendou prehensilis may be a complex of closely related forms, but I have not discovered any morphological character by which different nominal taxa herein treated as subjective junior synonyms can be unambiguously diagnosed. The following remarks summarize known patterns of geographic variation in phenotypic traits and discuss the application of available names should any taxa merit formal recognition in future revisionary studies. The largest specimens I have measured are from central Brazil and eastern Bolivia and the smallest are from northern Colombia . The latter were described as a distinct species by Allen , who claimed that they were about one-third smaller than Brazilian specimens, but Allen underestimated the mature size of this nominal taxon by failing to take ontogenetic variation into account . In fact, measurements of adult specimens from northern Colombia overlap with those of central Brazilian specimens in most dimensions , and these samples do not appear to differ in other external or craniodental features. 6.1 ± 0.5 15 6.2 ± 0.5 9 a Tabulated statistics include the sample mean plus or minus one standard deviation , the observed range , and the sample size. b From Cesar and Magdalena: AMNH 15459, 15460, 23471; USNM 281897, 281898, 281901-281906, 281908, 281909, 281912, 281914, 281916 . c From Minas Gerais, Goiás, and Mato Grosso: AMNH 1256/356, 134062, 134064, 134067, 134069, 134070; ANSP 4802; BMNH 1.11.3.70, 3.7.7.101, 3.7.7.102 ; ZMUC 521 . The epithet sanctaemartae is available should populations of Coendou prehensilis in northern South America merit subspecific recognition, but longicaudatus is an older name. Although I have not measured French Guianan material nor directly compared any specimens from the Guianas with northern Colombian material, measurements of Surinamese specimens suggest that Guianan populations are closer in size to central Brazilian than to northern Colombian animals. A third northern South American name, brandtii, is a junior synonym of longicaudatus . 4 In the event that any prehensilis-like northern South American porcupine merits recognition as a distinct taxon, a French Guianan neotype should be designated to fix the application of longicaudatus. The name platycentrotus is based on a mummified specimen of unknown geographic origin. Its quills are longitudinally grooved , possibly a developmental pathology or an artifact of having once been fluid filled and subsequently dessicated. In either case, they are surely not taxonomically diagnostic, and the specimen otherwise resembles ordinary material of Coendou prehensilis. Although the name has been applied to central Brazilian populations based on conjectures about where the type might have been collected , it seems best regarded as a nomen dubium. Gray 1850named boliviensis based on a specimen obtained by one Mr. Bridges, who is said to have collected it in the vicinity of Santa Cruz de la Sierra in eastern Bolivia . The holotype consists of the skin and skull of a very old animal, which plausibly accounts for its unusually large skull and proportionately small cheek teeth . Another distinctive trait of this specimen, its grooved upper incisors, appears to be an individual peculiarity. In all other respects, Mr. Bridge's porcupine closely resembles others collected in eastern Bolivia, as well as those from the contiguous dry forests of central Brazil. Gray also proposed the name tricolor for a specimen of unknown origin that was said to be darker than other prehensilis-like specimens then preserved at the British Museum. Although the type of tricolor is, in fact, darker than other mid 19th-century BMNH specimens, it is not sufficiently distinctive to justify the use of this name for any known geographic form of Coendou prehensilis in the absence of definite information about where it was collected. According to Moojen , the type locality of tricolor is Igarapé-açu , but I am not aware of any documentary evidence that the type was actually collected there. Thomas named centralis based on a specimen with less swollen frontal sinuses than other sympatrically collected specimens that he referred to brandtii. Although Thomas believed the observed disparity in sinus inflation \"too great to be due to individual variation\" , cranial differences between BMNH 3.7.7.102 and other porcupines from Chapada dos Guimarães do not exceed those that can be found within several series of Coendou prehensilis from other localities, such as the AMNH material from Anápolis or the USNM material from Valledupar. To be fair, such large series were unavailable in Thomas's day, so the individual variability of the species could not have been accurately assessed at the time. In effect, centralis is taxonomically indistinguishable from the eastern Bolivian phenotype to which the older name boliviensis unambiguously applies . Collectively, this material is conspicuously paler than the Pernambuco neotype of prehensilis , and side-by-side comparisons might reveal additional differences on which a taxonomic diagnosis could be based. That eastern and central Brazilian populations of C. prehensilis merit such scrutiny is suggested by cytochrome-b sequence analyses indicating substantial genetic divergence between them , but it would be prudent to defer formal recognition of any taxa here treated as synonyms of C. prehensilis until more comprehensive genetic sampling and morphometric analyses of this widespread species are available.

Coendou bicolor richardsoni: Cabrera, 1961 : 598 . Distribution: I have examined specimens of Coendou quichua from Panama, western Ecuador , and trans-Andean Colombia . Alberico et al. reported several Colombian specimens that I have not seen. Altitudes recorded on specimen labels suggest that the species ranges from sea level to about 3300 m. Remarks: Coendou quichua was treated as a subspecies of C. bicolor by Cabrera , and it is still listed as such by Woods and Kilpatrick . However, it is not clear whether or not Cabrera, Woods, or Kilpatrick ever examined specimens of these strikingly dissimilar taxa. Among other conspicuous differences, C. quichua is substantially smaller than C. bicolor , its longest quills are usually tricolored , its frontal sinuses are not or only slightly inflated , and the roof of its external auditory meatus usually has a well-developed transverse bony ridge . Although the name quichua has traditionally been associated with Ecuadorean material, Panamanian specimens hitherto referred to rothschildi are phenotypically similar and appear to be part of a single widespread but geographically variable trans-Andean species. Thomas are larger than Ecuadorian specimens, are more strongly speckled with white and have more inflated frontal sinuses, wider nasal apertures, and relatively smaller premolars. In fact, Ecuadorean and Panamanian specimens are about equal in size, as indexed by head-and-body length or maxillary toothrow length , but there are some noteworthy morphometric contrasts among representative samples . In particular, Ecuadorean specimens have much shorter tails than Panamanian specimens , smaller hind feet, and much narrower nasal apertures. However, most Ecuadorean specimens are from montane localities , whereas most Panamanian specimens are from lowlands and foothills, and this same suite of morphological differences Remarks: This species may be closely related to Coendou ichillus, C. pruinosus, and C. vestitus , all of which also have bristle-quills in addition to ordinary defensive quills and soft fur in their dorsal pelage. Diagnostic comparisons with those species were provided by Voss and da Silva , whose text should also be consulted for a detailed description of the skin and skull of C. roosmalenorum. Specimens examined: See Voss and da Silva . Coendou rufescens Erethizon rufescens Gray, 1865: 321; type locality \"Columbia\" . Coendou prehensilis rufescens: Trouessart, 1897: 621 . Echinoprocta rufescens: Cabrera, 1901: 159 . Coendou sneiderni Lönnberg, 1937: 17 ; type locality \"Munchique, Cauca\" in the Cordillera Occidental of Colombia. Coendou rufescens: Alberico et al., 1999: 606 . Distribution: Based on examined specimens and credible literature records, Coendou rufescens occurs in all three Andean cordilleras of Colombia , on both slopes of the Ecuadorean Andes, in northern Peru , and in northern Bolivia . Elevations recorded on specimen tags and in the literature document an elevational range from about 800 to 3500 m above sea level, but most records are clustered in the interval from 1500 to 3000 m . Remarks: This species has long been referred to the monotypic genus Echinoprocta, but there is no compelling evidence that rufescens is anything other than a short-tailed species of Coendou. Because the retention of Echinoprocta as a distinct genus does not appear to be motivated by any defensible hypothesis of reciprocal monophyly, I follow Alberico et al. in treating it as a subjective junior synonym of Coendou. Subsequent to Gray's original description, this species was redescribed by Cabrera , Trouessart , Lönnberg , and Alberico et al. . As noted by Alberico et al. , most specimens have a naked, calloused patch of skin on the dorsal surface of the tip of the tail, suggesting that this organ is prehensile like those of other Neotropical porcupines . The holotype of Coendou rufescens is a young adult with newly erupted P4 and unfused cranial sutures. The skin is in excellent condition, but the skull is fragmentary: the dentition is complete, but the occiput and most of the basicranium is missing, as is the right zygoma, most of the left zygoma, both nasals, and most of the premaxillae. In fact, the only taxonomically useful measurement that can be taken is length of the maxillary tooth row , which is 15.6 mm. By comparison, the maxillary tooth rows of nine adult specimens collected in the Cordillera Occidental of Colombia range from 16.7 to 19.2 mm, whereas the same dimension in two adults from the Cordillera Oriental of Ecuador are 16.7 and 17.4 mm. Thus, the tooth row of the type is shorter than those of other specimens that I refer to C. rufescens. Alberico et al. plausibly suggested that the type was collected somewhere in the Cordillera Oriental of Colombia, from which additional material should be examined for any future revisionary study. 5 The single Bolivian specimen I examined is morphologically indistinguishable from Colombian and Ecuadorian material that I directly compared with it. The specimen is a very young adult , which plausibly explains its small values for some age-dependent dimensions . I am, frankly, at a loss to explain how this species could be distributed over thousands of kilometers of highly dissected terrain with negligible geographic variation. Perhaps it is not fanciful to think that the Inca, who transplanted whole human populations from one end of the Andes to the other, might also have transported captive stock of this strikingly beautiful rodent over equivalent distances. Woods and Kilpatrick listed epixanthus Martínez as a synonym of this species, but Martínez simply applied the name epixanthus Brandt, 1835-a synonym of Erethizon 5 Although these authors \"restricted\" the type locality of Coendou rufescens to \"Quebrada Susumuco, 13 km WNW Villavicencio\" in the Colombian department of Cundinamarca , there appears to be no evidence that the type was actually collected there. Remarks: The specimens I refer to Coendou spinosus are small to medium-size porcupines with long tricolored quills intermingled with shorter bicolored quills over most of the dorsal surface. Most specimens have long fur, the individual hairs of which are blackish basally but have pale tips; in some specimens the fur is long enough to conceal the underlying quills over much of the body, but in other specimens the fur is sparser and lies over the quills in scattered tufts, and a few skins completely lack long fur . The ventral pelage consists entirely of soft fur. The mystacial vibrissae and the stiff bristles on the underside of the tail are usually bicolored: blackish basally with yellowish or orange tips. The frontal sinuses are not inflated and the dorsal roof of the external auditory meatus is smooth . By comparison, Coendou insidiosus differs from C. spinosus by having only short bicolored quills; pale-based or completely pale fur ; unicolored mystacial vibrissae and caudal bristles; and shorter tooth rows . Coendou nycthemera, another small species that occurs in eastern Brazil, differs from C. spinosus by consistently lacking long dorsal fur, by having spiny 5 5 BNA 9.7 8 10.8 4 11.6 7 BB 31.2 8 33.0 6 31.9 4 DI 3.2 8 3.6 7 3.5 7 BIT 4.4 8 4.9 7 4.8 7 a Table entries include the mean, observed range , and sample size for each measurement. b BMNH 2.4.7.28, 2.4.7.29, 25.5.1.10; MSB 54078; UMMZ 68132; USNM 115122, 115123; ZMB 35756 . c BMNH 3.7.1.98a, 3.7.1.99, 3.7.1.100, 3.7.1.102, 14. 5.9.17, 14.5.9.18, 29.6.6.67-29.6.6 .69 . d BMNH 92.11.24.1, 92.11.24.2, 98.1.6.1, 2.11.8.14; MCZ 1832; USNM 259793, 259838 . ventral pelage, by having unicolored mystacial vibrissae and caudal bristles, and perhaps in other diagnostic traits described by Handley and Pine but not carefully evaluated for this report. Geographic variation among examined specimens that I refer to this species includes modest size differences between Paraguayan and Brazilian samples and the more saturated pigments of specimens from more northern localities by comparison with those from southern localities. Whereas skins from Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo usually have orange-tipped tricolored quills and orange-highlighted fur, specimens from Rio Grande do Sul and Paraguay usually have yellow-tipped tricolored quills and fur that is washed with pale yellow dorsally and pale gray ventrally. Because geographically intermediate specimens seem intermediate in pelage characters, this pigmental variation could plausibly be interpreted as clinal. One specimen from Espírito Santo has pale-gray fur, superficially resembling that of Coendou insidiosus. This species was first described by Azara , who used the vernacular name \"couiy\" for a small Paraguayan porcupine with tricolored quills mixed with long fur. Azara's description served as the basis for paragayensis Oken, 1816, but Oken's names are technically unavailable . Another epithet based on Azara's porcupine is couiy Desmarest, 1822, but this is a nomen oblitum that does not appear to have ever been used by 20th-century authors as a valid name; under Article 23.9 of the current code , it cannot replace spinosus F. Cuvier, 1823, which is the name now commonly used for the small Paraguayan species . Frédéric Cuvier's important essay on porcupine taxonomy, \"Examen des espèces du genre porc-épic .

{"text": "Myotis simus was described by LaVal as ''usually bright orange or somewhat duller, varying from cinnamonbrown to cinnamon; tips not contrasting; below, hairs longer, tips yellow, bases Baud and Menu considered that the ochraceous coloration might be an effect of preservation rather than a natural feature. Specimens they studied were all mummy-brown and never ochraceous. The specimen of M. simus collected by us at Ayolas, Misiones, Paraguay, was a bright orange animal when alive. After a year of storage, the dry skin became ochraceous-brown, the same color as in some of the series from the Amazon Basin at AMNH and specimens from Bolivia. Dark, cinnamon-red individuals also occurred , and the red coloration remained after 15 years of storage in a museum. Other specimens from the same areas were dull brown, as described by Baud and Menu . We detected no geographic pattern to color variation, although apparent lack of a pattern may have resulted from change in color of specimens across time. Fringe of hair at the edge of the uropatagium was a diagnostic feature within species. It separated M. albescens and M. levis, which have a fringed uropatagium, from all other Paraguayan species. Some Paraguayan specimens of M. nigricans and M. riparius had a few hairs at the edge of the uropatagium that were sparse and required magnification to be seen. Presence or absence of a sagittal crest was a useful character to separate species in Paraguay . Intraspecific variation in degree of development of crests was minimal. All Paraguayan M. riparius had a crest, as did all examined specimens of M. ruber and M. simus. In a large sample of M. simus examined by LaVal , only 8 of 67 specimens lacked a sagittal crest. The P3 crowded to the lingual side was a diagnostic character for M. simus ; only 1 specimen of M. simus examined by us lacked that condition. Although M. riparius was described based on specimens with a crowded P3 , much variation in that trait occurred in that species. In Paraguay, only 16 of 59 specimens examined had P3 crowded to the lingual side, whereas 84 of 86 specimens from Central and South America had a crowded P3 . No geographic pattern in crowding was detected. This condition also occurred sporadically in M. nigricans. No single character sufficiently differentiated species of Myotis in Paraguay, except for insertion of the plagiopatagium at the level of the ankle, which separated M. simus externally from other species of Neotropical Myotis. The remaining species could be separated by a combination of the aforementioned pelage characteristics and cranial features . However, combinations of character states considered as diagnostic of species were not present in all specimens, reducing ability to make positive identification using only qualitative characters. Quantitative variation.-Because of small samples, secondary sexual dimorphism was not examined in M. ruber. Sexual differences in cranial morphology were not significant in any remaining species based on univariate or multivariate analyses, but sex by locality interaction was significant for greatest length of skull, condylobasal length, and length of maxillary toothrow in M. levis . The corresponding effect also was significant in the multivariate test . Interlocality differences also were significant in the multivariate test for M. levis . Significant geographic differences consistently were found for condylocanine length, mastoid breadth, zygomatic breadth, interorbital constriction, and length of maxillary toothrow . M. riparius differed significantly across localities according to MANOVA. However, univariate results were significant only for 1 character after adjustment; specimens from the Amazon Basin were larger for breadth across upper molars . The locality effect was highly significant in the MANOVA for M. simus . Specimens of M. simus from the Amazon Basin were significantly smaller than those from outside the Basin in 7 characters, and Bolivian specimens were significantly larger than those from Paraguay in 4 of those characters . Neither geographic variation nor sexual dimorphism was detected for M. nigricans or M. albescens. The PCA illustrated major trends in cranial morphology for populations examined . PC1 accounted for 70% of total variation in the sample and represented a general size axis. Smaller taxa had low or negative scores, whereas larger species had high, positive scores on that component. Because within-species variance was large compared with intertaxon differences for most variables, size alone did not discriminate among those species, with the possible exception of M. ruber. PC2 and PC3 indicated shape differences among taxa . Based on shape, 3 distinct groups of specimens were formed, M. albescens, M. simus, and the 4 remaining species . First and 2nd axes in the size-adjusted discriminant function analysis showed about the same relationship among species as did PC2 and PC3, except that, as expected, groups were more distinct . The first 3 discriminant axes accounted for 96.7% of total variation among taxa after size adjustment . That analysis also allowed recognition of 3 distinct cranial morphologies: M. albescens, M. simus, and the remaining species as a group . Relationships among M. levis, M. nigricans, M. ruber, and M. riparius were less clear, suggesting little speciesspecific differentiation in shape among those taxa. A relatively broad interorbital Table 4 and species codes as in Baud and Menu , was classified as M. albescens in 100% of 1,000 iterations in the bootstrapped DFA. Unlike many vespertilionids, in which females are larger than males , no significant difference in size between sexes was found for any species of Myotis from Paraguay. Although Myers and Wetzel found significant sexual dimorphism in Paraguayan M. albescens, they considered differences to be sufficiently small to allow for pooling sexes in morphometric analyses. Similarly, Willig found no significant sexual dimorphism in M. riparius from northeastern Brazil. Significance of the locality by sex in- teraction in M. levis may represent different expressions of sexual dimorphism in each subspecies, but because of small samples available and the high degree of overlap in size between them , these results must be interpreted with caution. Significant, albeit slight, geographic differences in cranial and external characters have been reported in M. nigricans and M. albescens from Bolivia, Chaco Boreal, and eastern Paraguay . Lack of significance for M. nigricans and M. albescens examined here may be the result of not including Bolivian specimens, which were the most differentiated in samples examined by Myers and Wetzel . In their analysis, differences between east and west were only marginally significant, with Chacoan specimens averaging 1-2% larger than eastern specimens. M. nigricans and M. albescens show opposite clinal trends in size south of the Amazon Basin ; M. nigricans is smaller to the south, whereas M. albescens increases in size with latitude. Geographic variation reported by Myers and Wetzel may reflect these clinal trends because the specimens used in their analyses were from a sample that largely followed a transect from the Bolivian Chaco south-southeast to eastern Paraguay. No geographic variation in size has been detected in M. riparius from Venezuela to eastern Peru to Uruguay . Specimens from western Paraguay were smaller than individuals from the eastern region in previous analysis . However, small samples precluded powerful statistical analysis of geographic variation in M. riparius. Our results reflect those of previous authors, although multivariate results were significant, only 1 of the variables examined was significant, and no pattern is apparent in variation of characters examined. Geographic differences may exist among populations of this species across its range, but available evidence is not sufficient to draw incontrovertible conclusions or to determine if a pattern exists. Geographic variation in M. simus had not been recorded previously. Specimens from the Southern Cone were larger than those from the Amazon Basin . In turn, Bolivian and Paraguayan specimens differed significantly in cranial measurements. Nonetheless, we believe designation of subspecies in this taxon is not warranted because no matching geographic pattern occurs in differences in coloration or any other external features examined so far. A comprehensive study of the entire range of the species would be necessary to evaluate the extent of interpopulational variation. Despite variation in size, shape of skull is consistent across populations within species. Neither PCA nor DFA suggested any distinct populations below the specific level. Five species are recognized for Paraguay: Myotis albescens, M. nigricans, M. riparius, M. ruber, and M. simus. DF1 was correlated highly and positively with characters related to length of rostrum and toothrows and negatively correlated with width of cranial vault and interorbital constriction. M. albescens and M. simus have a short rostrum, broad cranial vault, and wide interorbital constriction, whereas the remaining species have the opposite characteristics. Scores on DF2 were related to relative length of braincase with respect to total length of skull. DF2 was correlated negatively with characters related to width of rostrum and braincase. M. albescens and M. simus are essentially indistinguishable along the 1st axis but differed along the 2nd axis; M. simus has wider base of skull, wider rostrum, and shorter braincase. M. albescens has a comparatively narrow base of skull, which, together with the wider vault, confers the characteristic, globose appearance of its braincase. We concluded that M. levis has not been documented for Paraguay. The only specimen from Paraguay previously identified as M. levis has the cranial morphology of M. albescens. Additionally, dorsal pelage of this individual is long and dark, with frosted tips. Although the spec-imen is relatively large and frosted hair-tips occur in M. l. levis from São Paulo, Brazil , the specimen has a short rostrum, globose braincase, and wide interorbital constriction, which firmly place it within M. albescens. Nonetheless, the known distribution of M. levis in northern Argentina and southern Brazil suggests that it may occur in Paraguay. Although different in size and coloration, M. l. levis and M. l. dinellii are similar in cranial shape. Degree of cranial resemblance is comparable to that between M. nigricans and M. riparius , which are considered distinct species. In fact, M. levis and M. dinellii were described originally as species and subsequently relegated to subspecies of M. chiloensis by Miller and Allen , assigned by Cabrera to M. ruber, and referred to as M. levis by LaVal . Under LaVal's definition , M. levis occurs in southeastern Brazil, Uruguay, and Argentina. He recognized 2 major groups, M. l. levis from southeastern Brazil to Uruguay and M. l. dinellii from northwestern and southern Argentina. LaVal distinguished the 2 forms by size and color and remarked that differences between them were striking. M. l. levis is large with broad color variation across its range . M. l. dinellii, conversely, is smaller, with long, silky, strongly bicolored fur . Nonetheless, differentiation of these 2 forms is far from clear. Specimens from Argentina can be separated by size . However, specimens from Entre Ríos Province, Argentina, were intermediate between M. l. levis and M. l. dinellii . Our samples, which included specimens from Bolivia, Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay, were significantly different in size for only 4 of 14 cranial characters. We included specimens from Bolivia not available to LaVal, which ex-tended the range of size measurements for M. l. dinellii to overlap with that of the nominate subspecies in most measurements. LaVal suggested the existence of an intergradation zone between the 2 forms, or else possibility that they represented different species, but no data were available from intermediate areas to draw definitive conclusions. However, externally, the Bolivian material shows the characteristic coloration of M. l. dinellii . Although more material is available now, sample sizes are still insufficient to assess geographic variation in M. levis with statistical reliability. Clearly, populations now included as M. levis await thorough examination; additional, nonmorphologic information may help clarify taxonomic boundaries. Quantitative indices have been used to distinguish among Paraguayan species of Myotis. Cranial and maxillary indices describe different aspects of the skull . Maxillary index is a measure of size of rostrum; thus, M. albescens has smaller maxillary index, whereas M. levis would have large values. Cranial index is a measure of breadth of braincase and cranial vault; M. nigricans has small cranial indices, whereas M. albescens and M. ruber have large values. Clearly, these indices reflect overall cranial size. As such, they show a high degree of overlap and by themselves are of little use in separating species. Baud and Menu used them in combination, creating biplots of maxillary versus cranial index. Such biplots successfully separated M. ruber from the remaining species. LaVal used ratio of breadth across canines to interorbital constriction as a taxonomic character to separate species. This ratio is useful to separate M. albescens from the remaining species in most cases, although not consistently so designated a monotypic subgenus, Hesperomyotis, to include M. simus, based on its high degree of morphologic divergence from congeners. Our results indicate that degree of differentiation of M. simus is similar to that in M. albescens or M. ruber. With the evidence at hand, we see no reason to consider M. simus to belong to a different subgenus. A small species of Myotis, and the most distinctive of those occurring in Paraguay. Dorsal fur ranges from pale to dark brown or almost black, tipped with golden yellow or silvery white, resulting in a frosted appearance. Individual dorsal hairs are long ; ventral hairs are dark brown with buffy tips. Coloration of pelage ranges from almost black to sandy brown, always with frosted tips. Some specimens have Ն1 patches of rusty-brown or black hair on the dorsum. No difference in color was detected between specimens from eastern and western Paraguay. The plagiopatagium attaches to the toes . A fringe of hairs is present on the posterior border of the uropatagium, although it may be difficult to see without magnification. This character is consistent throughout Paraguay. The skull is of moderate size , with little forehead slope, and a narrow, short rostrum. Cranial vault and interorbital constriction are wide relative to size of skull. These characters separate M. albescens from all other species . External characteristics separate M. albescens from all other species of Paraguayan Myotis , except for M. levis and M. nigricans, which may have similar coloration. However, its globose cranial vault, short rostrum, and proportionally wider postorbital constriction suffice to separate it. Distribution.-Myotis albescens occurs throughout Paraguay, although it seems more common in the west . Remarks.-Although clinal variation in size exists for Mato Grosso , Paraguay, and Uruguay, no subspecies have been recognized . Reproductive biology and natural history have been described by Myers . M. albescens shares roosts with M. nigricans in the Paraguayan Pantanal. Findley classified this species as a forest and clearing aerial insectivore. Myotis nigricans This is the most common species of Myotis in Paraguay and on average the smallest . The dorsal pelage is silky. Coloration ranges from black on bases and tips of hairs in the eastern region, to sandy brown on tips with darker bases in the northwestern Chaco. Wing membranes insert at toes . Both rostrum and braincase are narrow, and upper molariform teeth usually are arranged in a row, although in a few specimens , P3 is crowded to the lingual side. M. nigricans usually lacks a sagittal crest, although some specimens from Fuerte Olimpo, Departamento Alto Paraguay, have a low, barely perceptible sagittal crest. However, pelage characteristics place these specimens in M. nigricans. This species is distinguishable externally from congeners in Paraguay by color, length and texture of hair, and overall size . M. nigricans can be confused only with M. riparius; these 2 species are more similar to each other than to any other Paraguayan species in size or shape of skull. However, M. nigricans generally is smaller, the ratio of interorbital constriction to breadth of canines usually is Ͻ1 , and M. nigricans lacks a sagittal crest, which is present in M. riparius. In Paraguay, pelage of M. riparius is not as distinctive as it is in more northern areas of South America and resembles that of M. nigricans. Some Paraguayan specimens reported previously in the literature as M. nigricans actually may be referable to M. riparius. Distribution.-Widely distributed throughout Paraguay in eastern and western regions . Remarks. -Four or 5 subspecies of M. nigricans have been recognized. Under either interpretation, Paraguayan populations can be ascribed to the nominate subspecies. M. nigricans has been found sharing roosts with M. albescens in the Paraguayan Pantanal. Reproductive patterns in Paraguay were described by Myers . Females give birth in spring and summer and probably continue at low frequency during autumn and winter. Males are aseasonal with regard to their testis cy- cle, no storage of sperm has been found in either males or females. Findley classified M. nigricans as a forest and clearing aerial insectivore. Myotis riparius Myotis riparius has short and woolly fur, buffy-brown dorsum, and individual hairs slightly burnished at the tips and slightly grayer toward the bases . Cinnamon-red specimens also may exist . The wing membrane attaches to the base of toes . The type specimen is large in external measurements , but with a comparatively small skull . The skull is long and narrow, and well-developed sagittal and lambdoidal crests are present. P3 is crowded to the lingual side in the type specimen. Broad variation in size exists among Paraguayan specimens. Nonetheless, M. riparius averages larger than M. nigricans. Dorsal pelage may not be as short and markedly woolly as it is in more northern specimens, and P3 is not always crowded to the lingual side in Paraguayan M. riparius. Moreover, P3 is crowded in some M. nigricans, which may make individuals difficult to identify. However, presence of a sagittal crest , the ratio interorbital constriction to breadth across canines Ͻ1, and shorter fur, are sufficient to distinguish M. riparius from M. nigricans when both skin and skull are available. M. riparius is distinguished easily from other species of Myotis in Paraguay by coloration and skull proportions. Distribution.-Most Paraguayan specimens have been collected in forested areas of the eastern region, although a few have been caught in the lower Chaco . No records are known from the dry Chaco. Remarks. -Little geographic variation has been detected in this species across its range , and no subspecies are recognized. According to LaVal associated with gallery forests that forages over water. Nonetheless, LaVal and Fitch reported 78 individuals of this species in the rainforest of La Selva, Costa Rica, collected well away from riparian environments. Myotis ruber Myotis ruber is a large distinctive bat. Dorsal pelage is bright cinnamon-red, relatively short, but silky, and monocolored or only slightly bicolored. The dorsal surface of the uropatagium is covered with hair to the level of the knees. The venter is yellowish, with dark brown bases. The plagiopatagium attaches at the toes . The skull is robust, large, and wide at its base; the rostrum is long and relatively wide, interorbital constriction is narrow, and sagittal crest is well developed. In Paraguay, M. ruber is distinguishable from other congeners by size and coloration . Because of similar size, the cranium can be confused with that of M. simus, which, however, differs in the position of P3, in having longer rostrum, narrower cranial vault, and ratio of interorbital constriction to breadth across canines Ͻ1. Distribution.-All known Paraguayan records are from the southeastern corner of the country, Departamento Itapua, and from Sapucai, Departamento Paraguari. M. ruber inhabits low semideciduous forests and is a rare bat throughout its distribution . Remarks. -Baud and Menu described M. ruber from Paraguay in a manner consistent with characters given by LaVal and clearly recognized differences between it and M. simus. Nevertheless, they assigned 2 clear M. simus , under their own definition and that of LaVal , to M. ruber. Skulls of M. simus and M. ruber are markedly different in shape . Both PCA and DFA placed these 2 specimens within M. simus. Additionally, both individuals have the characteristic short wooly pelage of M. simus, and insertion of the plagiopatagium is not at the toes. No subspecies are recognized . Myotis simus This is a large Myotis with extremely short woolly fur. Dorsal color ranges from a bright orange in fresh specimens to cinnamon-brown, to cinnamon. Tips of hairs do not contrast with bases on dorsal pelage. On the venter, hairs are slightly longer, with yellow tips and slightly darker bases. Membranes are dark brown to black. Unlike other Myotis in Paraguay, the plagiopatagium attaches at the level of the tarsals . This combination of characters externally distinguishes Paraguayan M. simus from other congeners. Large size, presence of a well-developed sagittal crest, crowding of P3 to the lingual side, relatively short, wide rostrum, wide base of skull, and short toothrow characterize M. simus cranially. In Paraguay, M. simus can be confused only with M. ruber because of their similarity in general and size of braincase , but they differ in shape of rostrum. Other characters useful to distinguish the 2 species are discussed in the account for M. ruber. Distribution.-Scattered records are available from the lower Chaco, the vicinity of Asunción, and Ayolas, Departamento Misiones . Argentine records are available from near Clorinda, Formosa, across the Paraguay River from Asunción and from Isla Apipé, Corrientes, across the Parana River from Ayolas . Remarks.-Myotis simus was originally believed to be confined to the Amazon Basin . More recently, it has been caught in Bolivia , Paraguay , and Argentina . Baud and Menu redefined the species, arguing that some of the most important characters used to distinguish it, insertion of the plagiopatagium at the tarsal level and a larger canine, had been misinterpreted or disregarded by previous authors. Based on a sample of South American Myotis, they concluded that M. simus was restricted effectively to the Amazon Basin, and it was never orange or ochraceous. Furthermore, they assigned Paraguayan M. simus to M. ruber. However, their sample was small and, by chance, included specimens with brown-colored fur. Specimens AMNH 71484-71486 for instance, are certainly not orange or cinnamon-red, as are other individuals from the Amazon Basin. Nevertheless, texture and length of fur are homo-Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jmammal/article/82/1/138/2372799 by University of Michigan user on 04 April 2022 geneous throughout its range and distinguish M. simus from all other Myotis, with the possible exception of M. riparius in northern South America. M. simus has been classified as a ''water bat,'' an over-water forager and inhabitant of gallery forests . ", "meta": {"ref_id": "82"}}

{"text": "The australopithecine ISD would then be lower than it is in seven samples of humans [range is 104•7 to 119•0 : Table 3) . These results all suggest that in the australopithecines, but not in humans, the ventral arc is disjunct from the absolute and relative lengths of the pubis and iliopectineal line. Consequently, we question use of the ventral arc for ascertaining gender in the australopithecines. 6 Pelvic funnelling reported that AL 288-1's pelvis is more funnel-shaped measurement of Sts 14 was based on a Transvaal Museum cast of the left hipbone that is in the collections of Kent State University, and not on reconstruction. 5 Calculation of this index required some reconstruction of the ischium of Sts 14. Häusler & Schmid carried out such reconstruction and noted as follows: ''the ischial tuberosities of Sts 14 were reconstructed according to the models of AL 288-1 and AL 129-52'' . 6 We do not agree with assessment of the ventral arc in the two australopithecine specimens, but will reserve our discussion with regard to this matter to a later publication. However, there is a fundamental difference between the two specimens-the presence of a clearly completed ventral rampart in AL 288-1, but an absence of any ventral rampart in Sts 14. This difference has a substantial effect on the interpretation of the position of the attachment of the common tendon of gracilis and adductor brevis on the two pubic corpora.  288-1:    the transverse diameter of the outlet is narrower than that of the inlet) than Sts 14's pelvis, and that this difference parallels the human condition in which human male pelves are more funnel-shaped than those of human females. However, based on Lovejoy's restoration of AL 288-1's pelvis, Tague & Lovejoy and Tague argued that both the transverse diameter of the outlet and the outlet's overall capacity were obstetrically adequate in AL 288-1 . If this conclusion is valid, then the funnel-shape of AL 288-1's pelvis is not meaningful for sexual identification in these earlier hominids. reported that AL 288-1 differs from Sts 14 in the same manner as do human males from females in the shape of the ischiopubic ramus. They reported that the medial aspect of the ramus is straight and broad beneath the pubic symphysis in AL 288-1 and human males, whereas in Sts 14 and human females the ramus is concave and has a ridge beneath the symphysis. In human females, the ischiopubic concavity enhances the capacity of the subpubic area and, thereby, facilitates fetal delivery through this space. First, we disagree with assessment of the form of the ischiopubic ramus in the australopithecine specimens. Both AL 288-1 and Sts 14 have remarkably similar ischiopubic rami, and the ramus of Sts 14 is essentially convex. Sts 14's ischiopubic ramus bears little or no relation to the true concave shape as seen in modern human females. Second, Tague & Lovejoy pointed out that the mechanism of birth in A. afarensis likely differed from that in humans, with the australopithecine fetus being delivered along the transverse axis of the outlet rather than through the subpubic space. Consequently, any ischiopubic concavity would not have been obstetrically relevant in A. afarensis. However, Berge et al. and argued that australopithecines had the same mechanism of birth as humans, and Stoller questioned the feasibility of the mechanism of birth proposed by Tague & Lovejoy . Third, and most important, Häusler & Schmid acknowledged that what slight differences that do exist between AL 288-1 and Sts 14 in the breadth and shape of the ischiopubic ramus may simply be artefacts of preservational bias: ''the marked differences between Sts 14 and AL 288-1 in the form and breadth of the inferior ischiopubic ramus are explained by erosion of the inferior rim of the ischiopubic ramus of Sts 14''. suggested that AL 288-1 differs from Sts 14 in the same manner as do human males from females in the development of muscle markings on the pelvis. In humans, such dimorphism is almost certainly a direct correlate of males being of larger body mass than females. However, body size dimorphism cannot account for a difference between AL 288-1 and Sts 14 in pelvic muscularity because reported that AL 288-1 and Sts 14 were equivalent in body size . This review of analysis shows that they employed criteria from three anatomical complexes inconsistently, and that their strategy of limiting the basis of australopithecine sex assignment to only those traits whose values fall within the modern human range of variation was not successful. Furthermore, as AL 288-1's pelvic outlet was probably 80 . .   . .  obstetrically sufficient , and as the mechanism of birth in A. afarensis may have differed from that of other hominids , the differences between AL 288-1 and Sts 14 in both the funnelling of the pelvic cavity and the subpubic area are also not relevant to sex determination. Consequently, we find analysis of pelvic dimorphism unconvincing. Obstetric adequacy of AL 288-1's pelvis argued that AL 288-1 was most probably male because its pelvis was obstetrically inadequate, relative to inferred newborn brain size, and that Sts 14 was female because its pelvis was obstetrically sufficient. They arrived at this conclusion by circuitous methods. Häusler & Schmid estimated the maximum brain size of a neonate that could pass successfully through AL 288-1's and Sts 14's pelves by identifying the ''critically small pelvis'' in human females that could deliver a newborn with a 382 g brain size. Based on line drawings, they determined ''the free space between the bony pelvis and the foetal skull [in humans] . . . [and] then proportionally transferred [this free space] to the pelvis of Sts 14 and AL 288-1. . . . In this way, it was possible to calculate the maximal neonatal head size . . . of the australopithecines'' . ", "meta": {"ref_id": "AL288‑1—LucyorLucifer"}}

Entepicondylar foramen of humerus absent; trochlear process of calcaneum positioned distally relative to posterior articular facet ; iliac blade of innominate and limb bones generally stout in proportions . Meristic traits of vertebral column indeterminate due to disarticulated condition of fossil samples. As underscored by our diagnosis, specimens of Noronhomys resemble those of Holochilus and Lundomys in many morphological features. The cranial similarities to Holochilus are many and include the comparatively large skulls with stoutly constructed zygomatic arches and reduced jugals; the relatively narrow constriction and amphorallike shape of the interorbit; the possession of vertically elongate postorbital ridges; the short, broad interparietal; the relatively short incisive foramina that terminate in front of the molar rows; the deeply recessed parapterygoid fossae; the absence of an alisphenoid strut; a derived carotid circulation and corresponding loss or occlusion of cranial foramina and vascular traces; and the conformation of the mandible and masseteric crests. Dental resemblances between Noronhomys and Holochilus are equally noteworthy: occlusal surfaces that are planar; pronounced involution of the enamel folds; reduction or absence of the mesoloph and loss of the mesolophid; broad anterocone lacking an anteromedian crease; presence of an internal enamel pit on ml; sigmodont form of the m3s; and presence of satellite roots on the upper and lower first molars. Considered together, the shared craniodental traits are sufficiently impressive to advance preliminary hypotheses of close phylogenetic relationship between Noronhomys and Holochilus and the more distant kinship of these two genera to Lundomys, hypotheses explored in broader phylogentic context in the next section. The weight of such similarities notwithstanding, substantial differences, both discrete and proportional, exist among these genera and warrant more detailed contrast. CRANIAL VAULT AND ORBITAL REGION: The skull of Noronhomys, although as robust as in Holochilus and Lundomys, has a flatter dorsal profile. The apex of the cranial vault occurs at about the middle of the parietals and slopes gently as a nearly straight line over the interorbit and rostrum. In contrast, the dorsal contour of the latter genera is evenly arched with the apex centered over the interorbital region . The stronger development of the dorsally di-1999 17 6h, L -Al I Fig. 9 . Occlusal view of right lower molars of adult Lundomys, Noronhomys, and Holochilus: A, L. molitor ; B, N. vespuccii ; C, H. brasiliensis ; and D, H. sciureus . rected supraorbital ridges of Holochilus perhaps exaggerates the dissimilarity in cranial profiles, but the interorbital construction of Lundomys more nearly resembles that of Noronhomys and still presents the same contrast in shape. The interorbital contour of all three genera is basically hourglass shaped and appears narrow relative to the expanse of the zygomatic arches . The dorsolateral margins of the frontals are squarely edged, not rounded, but do not form pronounced supraorbital shelves; slight supraorbital ledges do occur at the rear of the orbits in Holochilus and may be found in very old Lundomys and Noronhomys. Adult and older specimens of Holochilus possess a dorsally reflected supraorbital bead along the rear of the frontal, generally continued as a prominent temporal ridge over the squamosal and parietal. Even old adult Lundomys and Noronhomys lack such a raised bead but may exhibit temporal ridging of low relief. A rugose vertical crest or ridge, like that seen in Holochilus , marks the rear orbital wall of Noronhomys. A postorbital ridge is not developed in Lundomys. ZYGOMATIC REGION: The conformation of the maxillary root of the zygoma sets Noronhomys apart from both Holochilus and Lundomys. No anterodorsal spine is apparent in any of the six fossils that have the zygomatic plate suitably preserved. In each, the zygomatic notch appears relatively shallow, and the rostral border of the plate is nearly straight . Individuals of Holochilus and Lundomys, on the other hand, typically possess a protuberant anterodorsal spine, a feature that accentuates the depth of the zygomatic notch and the concavity along the forward margin of the plate . The position of the inferior root of the zygomatic arch, as observed relative to the molar rows . Lateral cranial profiles of adult representatives of A, Noronhomys vespuccii ; B, Lundomys molitor ; C, Holochilus sciureus ; and D, H. brasiliensis . The heavy vertical line approximates the position of the apex of the cranial vault when skulls are coaligned on a plane horizontal with their molar occlusal surfaces. and to the premaxillary-maxillary juncture, also differs. In Holochilus and Lundomys, the caudal border of the plate is set in front of the anterior root of the Mls, and its rostral border is situated well posterior to the suture of the premaxillary-maxillary bones. In Noronhomys, the rearward edge is situated more or less over the anterior root of Ml and the forward edge originates just behind the suture . As judged by the holotype of Noronhomys, which is the only specimen with a nearly complete arch, the jugal is small and irregularly defined, with the maxillary and squamosal processes of the arch being in contact. This condition, if representative of the taxon, agrees with that of Holochilus and departs from the consistently formed, larger jugal observed in Lundomys. The construction of the bony palate of Lundomys conforms to the long type , in which the posterior margin clearly extends behind the M3s. The long palate also characterizes adult specimens of H. brasiliensis, but in those of H. sciureus, it terminates more or less equal with the posterior margin of the M3s . In those examples of Noronhomys that have the palatal region in-tact, the hard palate reaches to only the middle of the M3s, and the mesopterygoid fossa correspondingly protrudes between them . Furthermore, the intermolar area of Noronhomys is relatively broad, without notable palatal gutters or a median longitudinal ridge as observed in mature examples of Lundomys and Holochilus. Variation in development of the posterolateral palatal pits may correlate with the posterior extent of the hard palate. These vascular foramina occur as highly perforated palatal recesses in both Holochilus and Lundomys; in Noronhomys, apparently homologous foramina penetrate the anterolateral walls of the mesopterygoid fossa but are not set within a conspicuous depression. ALISPHENOID REGION, OTIC CAPSULES, AND CRANIAL FORAMINA: A sturdy alisphenoid strut, separating the masticatory-buccinator and accessory oval foramina, can be verifed on several crania of Noronhomys. The strut is likewise present in members of Holochilus but is uniformly lacking in Lundomys . The auditory bullae of Noronhomys are moderately bulbous, shaped like those of Holochilus and Lundomys but less inflated. Fig. 11 .

In Lundomys, equally large temporal open-The apparently unequal size of the post-ings perforate the lateral wall of the brainglenoid foramen and subsquamosal fenestra case and define a thin, elongate hamular proand the short thick hamular process in Nocess . The damaged or partially concealed condition of the temporal region in the available fossil sample advises some caution in accepting these contrasts as typical of Noronhomys. In like manner, the slight dislocation of the bullae and their retention in so few specimens obscure the configuration of the tegmen tympani. The unmodified posteroventral edge of the squamosal nonetheless intimates that overlap and fitted contact are absent in Noronhomys, as has been described for other oryzomyines including Holochilus and Lundomys . Several fossil specimens with undamaged otic capsules have a pinhole-sized stapedial foramen that pierces the petrotympanic fissure. The reduced size of the stapedial foramen, together with the lack of a sphenofrontal foramen and squamosal-alisphenoid vascular groove and occlusion of the posterior opening to the alisphenoid canal, suggest that the orbitofacial circulation of Noronhomys originates mainly from the internal carotid instead of the stapedial artery . Such a tiny stapedial aperture occurs irregularly in individuals of Holochilus and Lundomys, genera that also have derived cephalic circulatory patterns . POSTCRANIAL SKELETON: Comparisons here emphasize aspects of the pelvic girdle, both because hind-limb bones were more frequently recovered as nearly intact or whole elements and because their morphology significantly relates to locomotory adaptations considered below. Although Noronhomys is contrasted with only H. brasiliensis in the illustrations , the differences noted are more exaggerated in the larger-bodied Lundomys and are generally less conspicuous in the smaller-bodied H. sciureus. The pelvis of Noronhomys is heavily constructed with a broad neck between the acetabulum and iliac blade. The greater circumference of its acetabulum , relative to those of Holochilus and Lundomys, is immediately obvious and predictably conforms to the wider diameter of the articular head of the femur . In Noronhomys, the femoral tubercle, a rugosity near the an-sgf Ĩ~g f terior lip of the acetabulum that provides origin for the rectus femoris muscle, is a small irregular mound; in both Holochilus and Lundomys, the tubercle forms a well-defined, conical eminence positioned farther craniad from the acetabulum . The lateral ridge in Noronhomys is gently rounded, the superior gluteal fossa broad and flat; the inferior gluteal fossa appears much smaller in area and faces more ventrad. In contrast, the innominates of Holochilus and Lundomys possess a more acute lateral ridge that scallops the lateral surface of the ilium, clearly demarcating the superior and inferior gluteal fossae; the inferior gluteal fossa is oriented more ventrolaterally, and its area is only slightly smaller than that of the superior fossa . The iliac crest in Holochilus and Lundomys also bends more conspicuously laterad and accentuates the curvature of the iliac blade. In general aspect, the long limb bones of Noronhomys are robust compared with the appendicular skeletons of Holochilus and Lundomys. This contrast is best conveyed by dimensions of the femur, the most abundant long bone recovered as intact fossils. Measurements of the head, neck, and shaft of the femur of Noronhomys typically exceed even those of H. brasiliensis or L. molitor , species that are considerably larger based on average femur length and craniodental size . The patellar fossa , the trough in which the patella slides, is shallow, short, and wide in Noronhomys but deeper, longer, and relatively narrow in Holochilus and Lundomys . The greater and lesser trochanters are developed similarly in all three genera; however, the lateral femoral crest of Noronhomys is scored by a shallow flute along its free edge, a feature not observed in Holochilus or Lundomys. The distal articular condyles are less rounded in Noronhomys, the breadth across their lateralmost edges being about equal to their anterior-posterior depth; the condyles of Holochilus and Lundomys are more bulbous and pulleylike in contour, their depth greater than the greatest width and the intercondyloid notch correspondingly deeper. The shape discrimination offered by these and other univariate differences are more readily appreciated in the multivariate analyses reported in the following section. In Noronhomys, the tibial crest forms a low, curved ridge that approximately bisects the anterior face of the upper tibia; the lateral tibial fossa is nearly flat and fully exposed in frontal view; and the crest is marked by a raised scar at its distal end where it merges with the shaft . In Holochilus and Lundomys, the tibial crest is straighter and displaced laterally, its anteromedial surface thus broad and smoothly convex; the lateral fossa is deeply concave and hence largely obscured in frontal view ; and no rugosity marks the distal end of the anterior crest. The medial and lateral ridges of No- ronhomys are short and low, defining a shallow posterior tibial fossa; in contrast, the posterior ridges of Holochilus and Lundomys are longer and project above the rear tibial surface, enfolding a cavernous caudal fossa . The proximal articular facets appear more convex on the tibiae of Holochilus and Lundomys, especially as observed in the posterior overhang of the lateral tuberosity. DENTITION: Voss and Carleton drew attention to the beveled edge and angular surface that mark the enamel face of the upper incisors in species of Holochilus. This faceted condition is more distinct in H. sciureus than in H. brasiliensis or Noronhomys. Moreover, the lower incisors in H. sci-ureus exhibit complementary development of an enamel facet and possess a wide, flattened lateral edge set off from a narrower medial bevel. Examples of H. brasiliensis and Noronhomys possess evenly curved enamel bands on the lower incisors, in contrast to the angularization that characterizes those of H. sciureus. Description of this subtle enamel variation and delineation of character states would profit from careful scanning electron microscopy and histological examination. The cuspidate molars of Lundomys differ strikingly from those of Noronhomys, in basically the same ways as it does from Holochilus . , and caudal views of the proximal half of the left tibia of Noronhomys vespuccii and Holochilus brasiliensis . Note the pronounced excavation of the lateral and posterior tibial fossae in H. brasiliensis and the presence of the rugosity on the tibial crest of N. vespuccii. Abbreviations are It, lateral tuberosity; Itf, lateral tibial fossa; mt, medial tuberosity; ptf, posterior tibial fossa; and tc, tibial crest. The moderately hypsodont, planar molars of Noronhomys and Holochilus are generally similar but contrast subtly in formation of certain enamel folds and their corresponding ridges. All preserved Ml and M2s of Noron-A homys have truncated but well-formed mesolophs that contribute to the planar occlusal surface . The short mesolophs, in lateralmost projection like those found in Lundomys, are consistently defined, unlike the B Fig. 15 . Dorsal and medial views of the lower right toothrow of A, Holochilus sciureus and B, Noronhomys vespuccii . Abbreviations are amf, anteromedian fossettid; ef, entoflexid; efd, entofossettid; mf, metaflexid; pf, posteroflexid; pfd, posterofossettid; and prf, protoflexid. Note the isolation of certain medial folds as enamel islands on the second and third molars of Noronhomys as compared with Holochilus, as well as the lack of an anterolabial cingulum and protoflexid on the third molar of Noronhomys. Lingual and labial folds of the lower molars of Holochilus broadly coalesce with the basal margins of the crown. On the lowers of Noronhomys, the posteroflexid of m2 and entoflexid of m3 are sequestered as enamel pits . Accordingly, the medial borders of the m2 and m3 are not dissected by emergent valleys corresponding to those visible on molars of Holochilus. Incipient isolation of the ml posteroflexus in Noronhomys is also suggested by its relatively shallow indentation along the medial wall. These contrasts hold even on the youngest, least abraded specimens of Noronhomys in our sample, which compare favorably in wear stage to young adult Holochilus. The dissimilarity in closure of the lingual folds may relate to the greater coronal hypsodonty seemingly characteristic of Noronhomys, an impression that we cannot easily quantify, however. The m3 of Noronhomys lacks a cingulum and enamel crease on its anterolabial corner ; however, both features are typically present on m3s of Holochilus and Lundomys, although small and weakly defined on some individuals. Examples of Noronhomys possess stout labial roots on the upper and lower first molars, like those found in Holochilus . Also like Holochilus and Lundomys, a smaller lingual root usually anchors the middle of ml of Noronhomysamong 44 specimens in which the crown base is suitably exposed, a lingual root is present and well developed on 9, present but weakly to moderately defined on 25, and apparently not formed on 10. MORPHOMETRIC ANALYSES The five population samples of Holochilus used in the numerical analyses are geographically scattered but fairly circumscribe the range of craniodental divergence in this widely distributed sigmodontine . Although usage of the nominal epithets H. brasiliensis and H. sciureus conforms to recent classifications of Sigmodontinae , we must emphasize the inadequate comprehension of specific limits among populations of Holochilus, in particular those now grouped under H. sciureus. Although insufficient to clarify the alpha taxonomy of Holochilus,3 the coarse sampling design does furnish an adequate backdrop to interpret variational patterns within our sample of N. vespuccii and to gauge its level of differentiation from continental forms. The fossil sample, given the disassociation of skeletal parts and their usually broken condition, constrained the analytical design and scope of multivariate analyses performed. Consequently, the following morphometric comparisons with living species were computed separately for mensural data obtained from crania, mandibles, and femora. SAMPLE VARIATION AND UNIVARIATE STA-TISTICS: Of the skeletal elements recovered for Noronhomys, only the mandibles, in view of their abundance, offer a suitable sample to assess population variation and homogeneity. Among the 15 measurements obtained from the mandible and its dentition, two subsets of highly intercorrelated variables are apparent-those representing the molars, which once erupted do not change in size, and those representing the dentary bone, which exhibits some age-related increase in size. Molar a Due to the variable preservation of recovered dentaries, not all measurements could be recorded for all specimens. * P -0.05; ** P -0.01; *** P < 0.001. dimensions are, in general, positively and strongly correlated ; correlation values of length and width measurements of an individual tooth typically surpass those recorded between different teeth. The other consistent association involves dimensions measured on the mandible and lower incisor , most of which also correlate positively with one another . The height of the ml, which incidentally decreases with advancing age, is inversely associated with this dentary subset, and significantly so except for length of the masseteric crest. Although correlation coef-ficients tend to be large and positive among variables within each subset, they are smaller, commonly negative, and usually insignificant between the two. The same two suites of intercorrelated mandibular variables also characterize the series of H. sciureus from Bolivia , although coefficients tend to be smaller than those computed for the larger sample of Noronhomys . Coefficients of variation impart a similar contrast among variables recorded from the mandible and lower dentition. Values of sample variation are typically small for all molar dimensions of Noronhomys , whereas they are considerably larger for those dimensions measured on the dentary and its incisor . Moreover, the magnitudes and patterns of measurement variability closely parallel that observed in population samples of H. brasiliensis and H. sciureus; these exhibit comparably small coefficients for molar size, intermediate values for incisor and mandibular dimensions, and greatest variation for the contingently age-related crown height . That postweaning growth, or lack thereof, explains some of the covariation among these measurements is suggested by sample means and analyses of variance derived from qualitatively defined tooth wear classes, which roughly approximate relative age of specimens. The dentary and lower incisor of Noronhomys exhibit relatively large, incremental increases in mean size from young to old-adult age classes; however, mean dimensions of the molar teeth vary little and erratically with respect to age. Correspondingly, f-values for age-related effects are much greater and significant for the incisive and mandibular measurements but small and negligible for all molar dimensions . Again, metaconid height of the first lower molar is inversely related to age, as indexed by tooth wear class, a factor which logically accounts for most of its extensive variation. Univariate ranges, correlation coefficients, and measures of dispersion among mandibular and lower molar dimensions of Noronhomys are unremarkable in comparison with those derived from population samples of extant Holochilus. Further, the intensity, direction, and pattern of these numerical associations conform to those reported for other muroid species, particularly in regard to age-related size increase of the mandible and incisor and to age-invariance of fully erupted molars , such divergence is minor relative to that attributed to age and geographic effects within sigmodontine species and wholly negligible compared with taxonomic differences between them . Lundomys and Holochilus are consistent with our current understanding of their generic and specific classification . The skull of the holotype of N. vespuccii stands apart from the samples of both Lundomys and Holochilus. The extremal position of Noronhomys on canonical variate II reflects certain breadth measurements and the long basicranium and toothrow relative to size of skull . On canonical variate III, the relatively short zygomatic plate , small ectotympanic bulla , and narrower molars similarly influence the high score of Noronhomys on this factor. Based upon log-transformed means of OTUs, the first two principal components extracted summarize most intersample variation . The large, positive correlations of most dimensions with the first component implicate general size as a primary explanation for the array of OTU scores . Along this component, the type specimen of N. vespuccii compares favorably with a large example of H. sciureus, a numerical finding which corroborates one's visual impression when laying out skulls for comparison. As in the canonical variate scatter plots, proportional contrasts in three variables largely account for the segregation of Noronhomys from examples of Lundomys and Holochilus on the second principal component . Several of the mensural variables that contribute to the consistent morphometric separation of Noronhomys lend objectivity to qualitative differences noted in the anatomical comparisons. For example, the narrower constriction of the interorbit and broader zygomatic plates of Holochilus and Lundomys agree with the patterns of variable loading uncovered and their influence on the ordinal segregation of Noronhomys, whether seen in discriminant function or principal component analysis . However, the large effect divulged for postpalatal length was unexpected with regard to the divergence of Noronhomys. The comparatively greater postpalatal length, and by extrapolation the basicranial segment this linear dimension spans, conceivably relates to the flat cranial profile characteristic of Noronhomys and certainly correlates inversely with the shortness of its hard palate. In summary, while we acknowledge the minimal sample size of one intact skull, the covariation patterns among the 15 craniodental variables depict the fossil form as something other than an insular variant of either Holochilus or Lundomys. In view of the ample number of mandibles recovered for Noronhomys, small sample size cannot be advanced to qualify interpretation of multivariate analyses based on measurements of the dentary and lower dentition. Thirty-eight of the 64 mandibles analyzed possess complete molar rows, and 18 of those are sufficiently intact to permit measurement of all 15 variables defined for the lower jaw. Compared with the topographically complex, three-dimensional conformation of the rodent cranium, a lower discriminatory potential might be anticipated for linear variables obtained from the flat, basically two-dimensional dentary. Nevertheless, principal component analysis of these dimensions, as extracted from the correlation matrix, still conveys the singular morphology of Noronhomys , Lundomys, and Noronhomys .

See Materials and Methods for explanation of OTUs. NO. 3256 Discriminant Function Analysis and One-Way ANOVAs Based on Craniodental Variables . Most variables, but especially molar lengths and widths, contribute strongly to variance of the first principal component, an association that is consistent with the separation of the two largest species, L. molitor and H. brasiliensis, from all others on this axis. No discrimination among taxa is apparent along the second component, which atypically emerged as an age factor as indicated by the large positive coefficient for crown height of ml and by the strong negative correlations disclosed for incisor girth and mandibular depth . The third factor extracted suggests the distinctiveness of examples of Noronhomys from those of Holochilus and Lundomys, an isolation influenced by certain molar dimensions, the narrow width of the incisor, and the long masseteric crest. The somewhat disharmonious combination of these variable covariations portrays Noronhomys as a rodent having a robust mandible, a long toothrow consisting of rel- atively narrow molars, and decidedly thin yet deep incisors. This shape syndrome contrasts with that observed in members of Holochilus, which also possess a robust dentary and long toothrow but have wider molars and notably broader lower incisors . We necessarily limited morphometric analyses of the hind limb to the femur because of its greater occurrence as an intact bone within Noronhomys material. Discriminant function analysis, using log-transformed values of the 13 femoral measurements, consistently isolated Noronhomys from the three living taxa on the second canonical variate extracted . Dimensions that influence the Noronhomys separation include those that reflect the greater girth of its femoral shaft , its stout neck and articular ball , and the area of the patellar fossa . All hind-limb variables are significantly and positively associated with the first canonical variate , which predictably sorts the specimens from smallest to largest ; on this -0.5 -0.4 -0.3 -0.2 -0.1 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 PC 1 Fig. 18 . Projection of sample scores on first two principal components extracted from analysis of log-transformed means of 15 craniodental variables representing six OTUs of Holochilus , Lundomys, and Noronhomys . axis, examples of Noronhomys are inseparable from those of H. brasiliensis. These results underscore the long, slim appearance of the femora possessed by Holochilus and Lundomys relative to the stocky conformation characteristic of Noronhomys . In order to better grasp shape differences with respect to age influences and possible allometric effects, ordination of the femoral data was repeated for the three largest species , and individual scores were plotted against actual femur length . Variable coefficients for the first principal component extracted from the covariance matrix again reveal the large positive correlation of this axis of variation with most measurements. For a long limb bone like the femur, much of its variation in greatest length plausibly represents growthrelated age differences, expressed as simultaneous increases in the girth of its shaft, the size of its articular condyles, and the size of processes for muscle attachment . Taxonomic separation is more clearly evident in the dispersion of scores along the second component, which instead suggests certain proportional contrasts in development of the distal articular condyles and associated patellar fossa and in thickness of the neck . In assessing the phylogenetic relationships of Noronhomys, we a priori accept the monophyly of the tribe Oryzomyini and its generic contents as recently argued by Voss and Carleton . This hypothesis has been generally borne out by subsequent cladistic studies surveying more sigmodontine taxa and additional morphological characters and by studies based on other kinds of data, such as karyology and DNA se- .

See Materials and Methods for explanation of OTUs. quencing . These tribal limits thus exclude the short palate, pentalophodont thomasomyines, contra Reig , but accord closely with the narrower definition of oryzomyines as first outlined by Thomas . However, membership of Oryzomyini sensu stricto does embrace certain tetralophodont genera that were formerly allocated to other tribes. Voss , Voss and Carleton , and Steppan review the taxonomic history of the Oryzomyini and discuss the morphological evidence for these generic reassociations. Diagnosis of Noronhomys necessarily required comparisons with Holochilus and Lundomys, but other oryzomyine genera were examined to provide a broader phylogenetic context. Prior studies have implicated a close kinship among Holochilus, Pseudoryzomys, and Zygodontomys , genera that also need to be considered in illuminating the relationships of Noronhomys. In addition, we included Oryzomys palustris, the type species of the genus, 0. subflavus, a South American relative of 0. palustris, and Microryzomys, a genus which is endemic to Andean wet montane forests and which possesses many plesiomorphic traits within the Oryzomyini . In total, 40 ordered characters, most restricted to cranial and dental features for comparability with available material of the extinct Noronhomys, are described below for nine species of Oryzomyini and a hypothetical sigmodontine ancestor . Char-33 1999 acter definitions and rationale for the polarities adopted draw upon a now substantive body of phylogenetic investigations on neotropical muroid rodents-for example, Hershkovitz , Carleton , Voss , Braun , and Steppan . In their study of Lundomys and Holochilus, Voss and Carleton elaborated upon and figured many of the characters listed below, so their polarity arguments are not repeated here. Remarks are given where our character-state treatment contradicts or clarifies aspects of the ongoing dialogue about muroid character analysis. The alphabetic order of states within most characters represents the hypothesized linear sequence of primitive to derived changes; the ancestral state of several characters is acknowledged as unknown and the condition of the five external variables for Noronhomys as missing. Character 1. Development of zygomatic plate and notch: plate narrow, notch indistinct; plate broader with moderately deep notch, anterodorsal margin smoothly rounded, without a sharp corner or spinous process; plate broad and notch conspicuous, anterodorsal margin produced as a sharp corner or spinous process. Character 2. Posterior margin of zygomatic plate: situated noticeably anterior to the alveolus of Ml, as observed in ventral view; approximately even with the alveolus of Ml. Remarks: Among the oryzomyines included, a more rostral placement of the zygomatic plate, as judged by the position of its rear edge relative to the molar row, is the usual condition . Steppan provisionally interpreted the relatively forward orientation as plesiomorphic in view of its slightly broader occurrence among his outgroup taxa; on the other hand, some paleontologists have considered the posterior disposition of the zygomatic plate in certain Miocene cricetids as ancestral to later forms that have the zygomatic plate produced forward. The state of this character in the hypothetical outgroup is recorded as unknown. Character 3. Size of jugal: small but consistently formed, zygomatic processes of maxillary and squamosal never in contact; tiny and irregularly formed, zygomatic processes of maxillary and squamosal typically in contact. Character 4. Interorbital shape and supraorbital ridging: hourglass shaped over midsection , supraorbital edges rounded in cross section, temporal ridging absent even in oldest adults; hourglass shaped over midsection, supraorbital edges squared, temporal ridging weakly pronounced except in old adults; hourglass shaped over midsection, supraorbital edges squared, slight shelf at postorbital margins with dorsally projecting bead, temporal ridging strongly expressed except in young animals; strongly convergent at midsection , supraorbital ledges pronounced with dorsolaterally projecting ridge, temporal .

Polygons enclose maximal dispersion of individual specimen scores around a group's centroid. ridging strongly expressed except in young animals . Remarks: Throughout the superfamily, the interorbital region of the muroid skull exhibits various and complex modifications that have spawned their own special terminology and comparative context. The shape of the interorbit and the elaboration of its dorsal rim figured prominently in the early alpha-level taxonomy of muroids and logically acquired significance as cladistic characters in estimates of higher-level systematic relationships. In recent attempts at phylogenetic reconstruction, some investigators have represented this variation as a single complex character , whereas others have separately emphasized features of interorbital shape from those of supraorbital ornamentation . The two aspects of interorbital configuration, as well as their relation to temporal ridging, are so strongly interrelated that the former treatment is adopted here: modifications of the supraorbital rim are coded as independently derived from state b. For the cladograms produced, the different coding approaches are inconsequential with regard to tree length or structure. Discriminant Function Analysis and One-Way ANOVAs Based on Femoral Variables present, concealing frontal-squamosal suture in adult specimens. Character 6. Breadth of interparietal: broad, strap shaped, nearly as wide as caudal border of parietals; narrow, wedge shaped, about half as wide as caudal border of parietals. Character 7. Extent of incisive foramina: short, not extending posteriorly to or between molar alveoli except in juvenile specimens; long, extending to or between molar alveoli in all or most adult specimens. Remarks: The ancestral state was treated as unknown in the hypothetical ancestor. Character 8. Configuration of palatal bridge: relatively broad and flat; narrower and moderately corrugated; narrower anteriorly, deeply furrowed with median ridge and occasionally with palatal excrescences formed at posterior end. Character 9. Posterior extent of bony palate: terminates noticeably short of posterior margin of M3s; extends even with or slightly behind M3s; extends conspicuously beyond M3s. Remarks: The development of the bony palate, particularly its production caudad beyond the molar rows, is a trait that was advanced first by Thomas . Whereas most thomasomyines do possess an unambiguously short palate , a long palate, although typical, is by no means ubiquitous within Oryzomyini. Among the taxa we consider, the bony palate terminates only slightly beyond or nearly even with the end of the third molars in examples of Microryzomys, Holochilus, and 0. subflavus; the palate is by operational definition \"short\" in specimens of Noronhomys. Character 10. Development of posterolateral palatal pits: usually a single nutrient foramen at posterolateral margin of bony palate; multiple foramina occurring at posterolateral margin, often recessed within oval pit; Fig. 21 . Plots of femur length against the first two principal components extracted from analysis of 12 log-transformed femoral variables measured on 19 intact specimens representing Holochilus brasiliensis, Lundomys, and Noronhomys . multiple foramina present in similar position but not set within oval pit. Remarks: Pronounced palatal pits characterize most oryzomyine species in our study. In Noronhomys, clearly circumscribed pits are lacking, but seemingly homologous foramina, as judged by their anatomical location, perforate the anterolateral wall of the mesopterygoid fossa; this character is conceivably associated with the unusually short Morphological Character States for Nine Oryzomyine Species Character bony palate of this taxon. Whether entered as an ordered or unordered character type in PAUP, the lack of well-defined pits was parsimoniously depicted as a character reversal on the branch leading to Noronhomys. Character 11. Conformation of the parapterygoid fossae: fossae relatively broad , approximately level with plane of the bony palate; fossae narrower , moderately excavated above bony palate; fossae narrow and short, cavernous, with anterior margins undercut. Character 12. Size of ectotympanic bullae: relatively small, exposed flange of periotic bone extends to internal carotid canal; intermediate, exposed portion of periotic bone smaller and not contributing to wall of carotid canal; relatively large, periotic bone mostly masked in ventral view. Character 13. Alisphenoid strut: present, buccinator-masticatory and accessory oval foramina separate; absent, buccinator-masticatory and accessory oval foramina confluent. Remarks: The consensus of outgroup comparisons conducted for phylogenetic studies of Muroidea has favored the presence of an alisphenoid strut as primitive . Steppan viewed the possession of a well-formed alisphenoid strut as derived for certain phyllotine species. Although many muroids, including most oryzomyine taxa, uniformly lack the strut, its presence varies within species of Oligoryzomys , Pseudoryzomys , Oecomys, and the Oryzomys nitidus complex . Such population-level polymorphisms lend plausibility to the independent fixation of this trait as present or absent in various descendent lineages. Character 14. Cranial foramina and carotid circulation: stapedial and sphenofrontal foramina present, vascular groove crosses the inner surface of the squamosal and alisphenoid bones, posterior opening to alisphenoid canal large ; sphenofrontal foramen and internal vascular groove absent, stapedial foramen absent or minute, posterior opening to alisphenoid canal irregularly formed or occluded . Character 15. Configuration of masseteric ridges: superior and inferior masseteric ridges converge anteriorly as an open chevron; anterior portion of ridges variably conjoined as single crest that extends nearly to the mental foramen. Character 16. Conformation of mandibular ramus: shallow, leading edge of ascending ramus oriented more obliquely, coronoid process placed lower than condyloid process, posterior margin of angular process about equal to that of condyloid process; deep, leading edge of ascending ramus oriented more vertically, coronoid process arches level with or above the condyloid process, angular process produced behind the condyloid process. Character 17. Enamel facets on incisors: upper and lower incisors smoothly rounded or flattened, without labial bevel; upper incisors somewhat flattened medially, with presumptive labial bevel, lowers unmodified; upper incisors flattened laterally, with distinct labial bevel, lowers flattened laterally with lingual bevel. Character 18. Molar coronal topography: brachyodont, cusps tuberculate with lingual and labial rows crested; higher crowned, cusps bunodont with lingual and labial rows unevenly terraced; moderately hypsodont, occlusal surface planar. Character 19. Molar occlusal design: cusps essentially opposite with rounded outer margins , lingual and labial folds not interpenetrating; cusps slightly alternating with rounded outer margins, some lingual and labial folds moderately interpenetrating; cusps conspicuously alternate with acute outer margins , some lingual and labial folds deeply interpenetrating. Character 20. Development of Ml procingulum: anteromedian flexus clearly inscribed on younger specimens, anterocone bilobate as lingual and labial conules; anteromedian flexus absent, anterocone broader with separate conules variably evident on only unworn teeth; anterocone wide, lacking any suggestion of a flexus or constituent conules. Remarks: Reconstructing the homology of enamel structures and contiguous hollows that attended the elaboration of the wide, entire procingula found in the upper and lower first molars of Holochilus poses uncertainties. For the Mls, the above transformation hypothesis acknowledges the coalescence of formerly independent lingual and labial conules and sequestration of the remnant flexus as an internal depression, as was interpreted for 0. palustris . Such a modification is suggested by the occasional presence in some juvenile Oryzomys and Pseudoryzomys of bilobate anterocones, a condition that is coded as an intermediate character state. On such specimens, a medial enamel border segregates the dentinal cores of the apparently conjoined lingual and labial conules. See Reig , Voss , and Steppan for further discussion and cladistic treatment of the procingulum complex in other sigmodontine rodents. Character 21. Mesolophs on Ml and M2: mesolophs present and long, typically extending from median mure to labial cingulum; mesolophs present and short, not reaching the labial cingulum; mesolophs absent or minimally suggested in unworn molars as an enamel deflection of the median mure. Character 22. Mesoloph on M3: usually present and well developed; absent or vestigial. Character 23. Anteroloph on Ml: present and well developed, extending to labial cingulum; present and short, not extending to cingulum; absent. Character 24. Posteroloph on Ml and M2: present, moderately long and persisting until later wear stages; present, short and disappearing after little to moderate wear; absent. Character 25. Protoflexus of M2: present as a shallow indentation, at least in unworn dentitions; absent. Character 26. Development of procingulum on ml: anteromedian flexid present, defining anterolabial and anterolingual conulids and communicating with anteromedian fossettid; anteromedian flexid absent, anteroconid a single wider cusp, and anteromedian fossettid, anterolophid, and protolophid variously defined; anteroconid broad, enclosing an internal enamel pit, other procingular elements indiscernable. Remarks: Like its occlusal counterpart on the upper first molar , the formation of the ml procingulum, particularly the derivation of the so-called internal enameled pit of certain oryzomyines , remains obscure. The morphology of the enamel pit appears similar among the genera Pseudoryzomys, Holochilus, Lundomys, and Noronhomys. This procingular basin may represent a phylogenetic remnant of the anteromedian fold that became enclosed: anteriorly by fusion and broadening of the lingual and labial conulids along their forward rim; and posteriorly by retention and hypertrophy of the medial segments of the anterolophid, protolophid, and possibly the contiguous portion of the murid. All of these elements are irregularly defined in species of Oryzomys, in which the size of an ml pit is neither so large nor its boundaries, especially at the posterior border, so completely formed. This procingular condition is coded as intermediate to those observed in Microryzomys and the four genera mentioned above. Character 27. Mesolophids on lower molars: consistently present and well-developed, extending to lingual cingulum; present and short, not meeting the lingual cingulum; clearly defined as a discrete entity from the hypoconid; boundaries of the posterolophid and hypoconid indistinct, the two continuous as a broad loph across the rear margin of the tooth. Character 29. Protoflexid of m3: present, short anterolabial cingulum well defined, at least in unworn teeth; absent, anterolabial margin of m3 smoothly rounded. Character 30. Posteroflexid of m3: present; absent. Remarks: The posteroflexid in examples of Z. brevicauda is observable in only very young specimens with scant wear on the m3; those of Z. brunneus possess a larger fold that generally persists until later wear stages . The obliteration of the posteroflexid, together with other coronal rearrangements-loss of the mesolophid, suppression of the entoconid, and coalescence of the hypoconid-posterolophid-yield the \"s-shaped\" third molar central to Hershkovitz's classical definition of the sigmodont group. Character 31. Lingual folds on m2 and m3: m2 posteroflexid and m3 entoflexid open to lingual margin of tooth; lingual folds isolated as enamel islands on m2 and m3 , respectively. Character 32. Labial root of Ml: absent; present. Character 33. Accessory roots of ml: absent, ml with two roots; labial accessory root present, lingual root smaller and variable, three or four roots total; labial and lingual accessory roots present and typically well developed, four roots total. Character 34. Relative size of M3: longer than second molars, principal coronal features of posterior half of third molars recognizable; distinctly shorter than second molars, posterior half noticeably reduced and serial enamel homologies obscured or distorted. Character 35. Relative size of m3: shorter than second molars, reduction principally evident in posterior half such that serial enamel homologies may be obscured; subequal in size to second molars, principal coronal features of posterior half of third molars recognizable; longer than second molars. Remarks: The character state for both upper and lower third molars was recorded as unknown in the composite ancestor. Within Muroidea, the contribution of the last-erupted molars to overall toothrow length and occlusal area is not necessarily positively correlated in the upper and lower dentitions of the same species. Commonly, the M3 is noticeably smaller relative to M2, its occlusal details distorted, while the m3 approximates the size of the m2, its enamel landmarks clearly discernable. Systematists have rendered differing polarity interpretations for departures from this prevalent plan . Character 36. Ungual tufts on hind foot: present; absent. Character 37. Natatory fringe on hind foot: absent; present. Character 38. Plantar pads on hind foot: pads large and fleshy, interdigitals 1-4 set close together, hypothenar conspicuous; pads smaller, interdigitals 1 and 4 displaced proximally relative to 2 and 3, hypothenar present but small; pads distributed as in state but tiny and of low relief, hypothenar pad absent or minute. Character 39. Interdigital webbing on hind foot: absent; present but small, not extending to first interphalangeal joint of any digits; present and large, extending to or beyond first interphalangeal joints of digits II, III, and IV. Character 40. Conformation of hind feet: digits 11-IV slightly longer than I and 41 1999 Noronhomys vespuccii Fig. 22 . Hypothesis of relationship among nine oryzomyine taxa based on 35 craniodental characters . Derived character-state changes are portrayed according to delayed transformation optimization of intermediate taxonomic units. V; nail of digit V extends to terminal phalanx of digit IV; digits II-IV conspicuously longer than I and V; nail of digit V extends to second phalanx of digit IV. Phylogenetic reconstructions based on PAUP were conducted first for the 35 craniodental characters and then for the entire data set, including the 5 external traits. The minimum number of changes represented by the craniodental data , absent any homoplastic conversions, is 54 steps. However, for the ancestral states and polarity sequences argued above, maximum parsimony yielded just one shortest tree of 77 steps . Elimination of three unique states and one cladistically uninformative character reduced the tree length to 73 steps . The same cladistic topology among the terminal taxa was preserved in additional par-simony analyses, whether treating all multistate characters as unordered or designating extant Microryzomys as the default outgroup , although tree lengths and hypothesized character state changes perforce differed slightly . Noronhomys vespuccii is hypothesized to share closest common ancestry with species of Holochilus, a relationship sustained by 18 apomorphic changes. Of these, 10 characterstate transitions are unique and unreversed, including some traits of the cranium and many of the dentition . The branch leading to Noronhomys contains seven derived states, only three of them-autapomorphies; the seven involve loss or occlusion of minor enamel features , shortening of the bony palate and the possibly correlated reduction of palatal pits , and formation of the zygomatic plate . Under the accelerated transformation option of PAUP, the length of the stem uniting the two species of Hclochilus is correspondingly shortened and two additional reversals contribute to the branch of Noronhomys-a flatter palatal bridge and diminution of the auditory bulla . The remainder of our tree conforms to the cladograms generated by Voss and Carleton and Steppan for those taxa common to all three studies. Areas of agreement include the earlier differentiation of Oryzomys sensu stricto and the monophyletic grouping of Pseudoryzomys, Lundomys, and Holochilus. For the characters defined here, the recognition of the last three genera as a clade results from unique changes in supraorbital design and the ml procingulum and from homoplastic transformations that involve formation of a zygomatic spine , modification of carotid circulation , and proliferation of accessory roots on ml . The cognate affinity of Zygodontomys and is due mostly to the loss of the anteroloph and mesoloph , enamel structures that characterize the more complex, pentalophodont molars found in Microryzomys and Oryzomys. Finally, the retention of so many primitive states by the Andean genus Microryzomys assures its basalmost origin relative to the other oryzomyine rodents included . Two clades were invariantly recovered in bootstrap iterations for the 35 craniodental transformations defined -one consisting of all taxa that form a sister-group to basal Microryzomys and the other containing Noronhomys and Holochilus. Other moderately to strongly supported internal nodes, as indicated by bootstrapping values and Bremer indices, include the cognate affinity of Pseudoryzomys and and the monophyly of Holochilus. Predictably, the two weaker clades uncovered through bootstrap resampling subtend those taxa for which alternative phylogenies are found in the two next-shortest trees generated . In one tree of 78 steps, Pseudoryzomys, instead of Lundomys, is arranged as the sistergroup to Holochilus and Noronhomys ; in the other, the genus Oryzomys is depicted as paraphyletic, with 0. subflavus and 0. palustris forming successive outgroups to the remaining taxa . The closer kinship between Pseudoryzomys and emphasizes parsimony for derivation of the conjoined masseteric ridge , gain of the labial root on Ml , and losses of the anteroloph and mesolophid ; in this tree , the genus Pseudoryzomys is undifferentiated from the node that subtends it and . In the shortest tree of 77 steps , these changes are reconstructed as parallelisms between Pseudoryzomys and the lineage and as reversals defining the Lundomys branch. The placement of 0. subflavus as a clade apart from 0. palustris stems from parsimonious rearrangements that involve character differences between these species-extent of the hard palate and ml root development . Further, those shared character states in the most parsimonious tree are instead depicted as parallelisms within each species branch. A single shortest tree was again generated when using all 40 characters . Compared with the phylogeny estimated with only the 35 craniodental attributes, tree length is concomitantly longer , yet branching structure is entirely congruent and measures of character homoplasy are nearly alike . In effect, addition of the five external characters for the eight extant taxa bolstered the stems subtending Pseudoryzomys and kin and the clade, resulting in higher bootstrap percentages and Bremer indices . These character-state transitions involve hind-foot adaptions for a semiaquatic lifestyle, including reduction of the ungual tufts , acquisition of stiff fringing hairs , diminution of the plantar pads and loss of the hypothenar , and elaboration of interdigital webbing . Parallel changes of several of these are foreshadowed within the line leading to 0. palustris. Fig. 23 . Support measures for most parsimonious trees of nine oryzomyine species, with Bremer indices indicated above internal stems and bootstrapping percentages below. A, Cladogram obtained from 35 craniodental characters . B, Cladogram obtained from 35 craniodental and 5 external characters. None of the alternative choices of outgroup, character-type assumptions, character sets, or next-shortest trees discussed above disturbs the sister-group stature of Noronhomys and Holochilus. Nor was Noronhomys ever associated with another genus in any partition of greater than 5% frequency generated through bootstrap replicates. The robustness of the inferred relationship is anticipated by the comparatively large number of apomorphies that accrue along their nodal branch . However, one of three trees recovered with 79 steps represented the relationship of H. brasiliensis, H. sciureus, and Noronhomys as an unresolved trichotomy. Of the four characters that defined a monophyletic genus Holochilus in the shortest tree, two are instead represented as parallel changes within each species of Holochilus and two are redistributed as reversals in the line leading to Noronhomys. Notwithstanding the cladistic uncertainty conveyed by this longer tree, the brunt of the character information and parsimony analyses persuasively implicates mainland Holochilus as genealogically closest to the island fossil. Prior to Olson's discovery in 1973, the only recorded historical sighting that conceivably pertains to a native rodent on the island of Fernando de Noronha comes from the account of the Fourth Voyage of Amerigo Vespucci-the Florentine adventurer after whom the New World is named. This reference appears in the Lettera di Amerigo Vespucci delle Isole Nuovamente in Quattro Suoi Viaggi, in which his putative exploits in Fig. 24 . The next two most parsimonious trees derived from the 35 craniodental characters presented in table 11 . Compare with the shortest tree illustrated in figure 22 .

The branch lengths are proportional to the number of character state-changes along them, but only transformations of the five external characters are portrayed . the New World are recounted as four voyages made between 1497 and 1504 . Addressed to Piero di Soderini, gonfalonier of the Florentine Republic, the Lettera was published in Florence in September 1504 and was being widely reproduced and circulated by 1505. In 1507, a popular Latin translation was included in Martin Waldseemuller's Cosmographiae Introductio, the first work in which the name \"America\" appeared on a map of the newly found lands in the west. Historians and linguistic scholars, however, strongly doubt that Vespucci was directly responsible for the Lettera, and the earlier printed Mundus Novus, or that he sanctioned their dissemination . The Lettera and Mundus Novus were manifestly designed for popular consumption to celebrate the achievements of a Florentine native son, expressly as counterpoint to the transatlantic explorations of Columbus, a Genoese, and were printed during a time of intense patriotic and political rivalries. The two public documents contain many internal contradictions and inconsistencies of chronology and geography, and so contrast with the style and tone of Vespucci's so-called \"familiar letters,\" sent to Lorenzo de Medici, his longtime patron. Historians have accepted the personal correspondences, which originally circulated in only manuscript form, as proof that Vespucci did undertake some voyages to the New World, namely those traditionally numbered as the second and third . With regard to these navigations, one for Spain and one for Portugal , the familiar and public documents retain much general and specific agreement. This complementarity has led historians to suspect that composite accounts were forged by persons unknown, who drew extensively upon information contained in the familiar letters and other Vespuccian manuscripts now lost, and embellished other details of destination and chronology to emulate a Colombian four-act drama. Formisano thus characterized the Mundus Novus and Lettera \"as texts that might best be labelled not pseudo-but rather para-Vespuccian.\" ", "meta": {"ref_id": "AmerigoVespucciandtheratofFernanadodeNoronha"}}

{"text": "In Haveliwala 's approach, a set of topic-specific PageRank vectors is computed only from pages relevant to the query, which are then used to retrieve results for a query on a particular subject. Since the reptiles and amphibians database provides a smaller domain that cannot be easily broken up in more subdomains, the query-sensitive RecordRank module does not use precomputed vectors. Instead, for each query the RecordRank scores are computed at run-time, but only for the retrieved results. We distinguish the two flavours of RecordRank as Global RecordRank, in which database records are ranked by authority regardless of the query, and Local RecordRank, in which database records are ranked after records are retrieved. Analysis of the queries has shown that queries do not usually pertain to information in some of the longer database columns such as special remarks. Hence, when giving each column equal importance a query such as Bufo marinus will return results such as: RMNH 34003 Bufo marinus Lely Range, airstrip, distr. Marowijne, Surinam, 11-05-1975 , 15.50h, on airstrip, near tall forest, 650m,l+d.X.X. Xxxxxxxxx. RMNH 34003 as well as: RMNH 20761 TANK NO Slide 1980 Paleosuchus trigonatus 1 ex. km 110, 19-09-1980, 20.45 h, in swamp, flooded part of forest with many dead trees and low bushes, near jeep trail through tall forest, 100 m. length 1.445 m, skin and carcass to create skeleton. Stomach contents kept separately: crab + Bufo marinus + grit. Observed this specimen already on 16-09-1980 . After analysis of the queries it was clear that a large majority of the queries pertain to the request for information from the genus and species columns and never from the special remarks column in which one might find information on a specimen's stomach contents. Records with matches found in these columns, as well as in the registration number column are thus presented before records with matches found in other columns. In this section, the results of the experiments of the retrieval of records from the reptiles and amphibians database are presented. Only the first 5000 results returned for each query are evaluated using the evaluation script used in the Text REtrieval Conferences 14 Table 8 . Precision, recall and mean average precision scores for baseline and expansion modules each of the tables presented below, the bold face results are significant with respect to the baseline results that the module is compared to. All significance scores are computed at the p=0.05 level using a paired t-test. The ALL query mode denotes a simple keyword search in which only records should be retrieved in which all query terms match. The ANY query mode is another simple query mode in which records should be retrieved in which any of the query terms match. The interpreted query mode is denoted by COMPLEX in the tables. The precision, recall and mean average precision for the interpretation and expansion modules are presented in Table 8 . As the results in Table 8 show, the ALL query mode benefits more than the ANY query mode of the query expansion. This is due to the fact that the ANY query mode already achieves high recall, simply because it retrieves records in which at least one of the query terms match. Separately, the expansion modules perform best . When combined, and thus when they expand both the geographic and the taxonomic queries , the achieved results are mixed. For the ALL query mode, the precision does not deteriorate significantly , but recall does not improve as much as expected, therefore this module is not further investigated. This is probably due to an explosion of expanded terms for each query term and the subsequent retrieval of too many records. The experiments carried out with the query interpretation module are found in the lower part of Table 8 . The precision and mean average precision scores for the interpreted query mode are significantly higher than for the simple query modes. On its own, the COMPLEX query mode improves the mean average precision with 5.83% over the ALL query mode, and with 7.59% for the ANY query mode. Together with the query expansion modules, the COMPLEX query mode helps improve the scores even more, in particular the geographic expansion module. The difference in recall between the unexpanded ALL query mode experiments and the geographically expanded COMPLEX query mode experiments is even more than 50% . Also the ALL query mode benefits from query expansion. In Table 9 the mean average precision scores for the ranking modules are presented. Our assumption that the RecordRank modules would aid performance because the more authoritative records are presented first proved wrong. For the unexpanded queries, the mean average precision improves, but not significantly. For the expanded queries, the RecordRank modules even harm performance. the expert better, but also provide means to visualise search results in ways suitable to the layperson, such as plotting findings on maps and timelines. Our contribution then focused on two systems aimed at improving the accessibility of data in the CRS; the systems are semi-automatic, in the sense that they perform automated steps in the process of data cleaning and data retrieval, with the aim of supporting experts by saving time and finding relevant information faster. The computer-supported data cleaning system presented uses logical rules to detect clear violations of constraints in pairs of dates , in geographical names , and in taxonomic names . The fact that 'hard' domain constraints are used does not constrain the applicability of the system . ", "meta": {"ref_id": "ChangingDiversityinChangingEnvironment.json"}}

{"text": "1 -' -- A ------.....-..... The elongated cervicals with distinct mid-ventral keels, closely appressed rib facets, and low neural spines are conspicuous features of Malerisaurus. The centra are weakly amphicoelous cylinders throughout the series , constricted in the middle, and are firmly fused with the neural arches. No intercentra are present behind the axis . The cervical vertebrae are rather uniform in their morphology. The length of the centrum increases from the axis to the sixth cervical , then decreases again posteriorly. The zygapophyses are very pronounced, extend beyond the faces ofthe centra, and slope inward and downward close to 45°. Both the rib facets are closely set at the anterior end; the parapophysis arises low down on either side of the ventral keel , while the diapophysis overhangs the arch where it joins the centrum. The beginning of the dorsal series can be recognized by the lack of a ventral keel on the centra and the confluence ofthe rib facets. Proceeding backward along the column, the transverse process becomes longer, horizontally directed, and slightly displaced in a posterior direction. The zygapophyses become smaller and extend laterad slightly beyond the centra. The neural spines become taller and are essentially rectangular in side view, angling slightly posterior from the vertical. The average length of a centrum of the mid-dorsal column is 1.6 cm, half th e length of th e average cervical. The sacrum consists of two separate vertebrae bearing strong sacral ribs. The first sacral rib is stout and crescentic in end view; the second one is thin, bladelike , and compressed dorso-ventrally. In the proximal caudals, the neural spines are well developed, and the ribs are fused with the vertebrae and extend laterally. The chevron facets first appear on the third caudal and continue backward. Distally, the centra become more slender and longer, the spines become low and diminish gradually, the zygapophyses reduce in size , and the transverse processes become very weak and then finally disappear. Shoulder Girdle and Forelimb -The scapula is narrow and high. The glenoid is thickened and consists of a pair of articulating facets ; the upper one is semi-circular, the lower one elliptical. Just above the glenoid, a tubercle on the scapula marks the point of insertion of the proximal tendon of the triceps muscle. The coracoid is a curved bone, elongated antero-posteriorly, and has a prominent post-glenoid projection below and behind the glenoid. A small coracoid foramen appears to be present in front of the glenoid. The interclavicle is broad, T-shaped, and the cross bar is slightly notched anteriorly on the ventral surface for the reception of the clavicles on either side. The median bar is flattened dorso-ventrally and gradually ta- pers posteriorly. The clavicles were not found in the collection. The humerus has expanded ends and a narrow shaft linking them. The proximal and distal articular regions are set at about 45°to each other. The proximal head has a convexity for articulation with the glenoid. Antero-ventrally, the delto-pectoral crest curves from the head to bound the large trochanteric fossa. Distally, there is a prominent ectepicondylar groove on the lateral side. The radius is shorter than the humerus. It expands proximally into a triangular head and has a concave facet for articulation with the humerus. The shaft is curved, slender, and bears a ridge on the posterior aspect. The distal end is expanded slightly, oval in outline, and has a convex surface for the radiale. Pelvic Girdle and Hind Limb -The ilium contributes the major portion of the closed acetabulum. The acetabulum is dorso-ventrally elongated and is bordered along the anterior rim by the supra-acetabular buttress. The posterior process of the iliac blade is strongly developed and extends beyond the posterior margin of the ischium. The anterior process is short. The pubis forms the antero-ventral rim of the acetabulum. The anterior border curves laterally as it descends. Posteriorly, it meets the ischium in a straight, thin edge, leaving a gap in between the two bones farther ventrally. Anterior to this contact lies a large obturator foramen. The dorsolateral border of the ischium is slightly convex, rather than concave, in lateral view, and has a pointed, rather than rectangular, posterior end. There is strong disparity in limb proportions; the fore limb is about 70% the length of the hind. The femur is relatively long and slender, and shows a primitive --------..... --1,~ The internal trochanter is very well developed; it extends ventrally below the level of the shaft and forms the anterior margin of the shallow intertrochanteric fossa. Distally, the femur is expanded and divided into two condyles for tibial articulations. The fibula was received in the postero-Iateral comer, where a groove indicates a sliding contact. It was at least partly a weightbearing bone. The tibia is 90% the length ofthe femur. It has a much enlarged, triangular, proximal head , with a weak cnemial crest on the anterior surface. The shaft is long, slender, and bears an oblique ridge that extends from the proximo-lateral to disto-medial extremities. The distal end is slightly expanded and shows a flat surface for the astragalus. Contrary to this situation, a distinct notch is present here in Malerisaurus robinsonae for receiving the astragalus. Chatterjee restored Malerisaurus as a small, gracile, long-necked archosauromorph with facultative bipedal and quadrupedal gait. From the comparisons oflimb proportions and short trunk region, it was concluded that Malerisaurus was capable of running bipedally, when occasion demanded, as effectively as some of the extant lizards such as Basiliscus and Chlamydosaurus. The skeletal and life restorations of Malerisaurus langstoni are shown in Figure 8 . Adult Malerisaurus would be about 1.2 m long from snout to tail tip with an estimated live weight of 10 kg. The Upper Triassic Dockum Formation of Texas is a continental red-bed sequence accumulated in a mosaic of fluvial, lacustrine, and flood plain deposits . The skeletons ofMalerisaurus were found almost articulated, and juvenile Trilophosaurus skeleton was found alongside them. The specimens were recovered from Quarry 2 , Otis Chalk locality of Howard County. Here the dominant lithology is red mudstone intercalated with lenses of fine-grained sandstones and conglomerates. Quarry 1 and Quarry 2 are only 100 meters apart, and the fauna is dominated by well-preserved, mostly terrestrial vertebrates with a few aquatic members . The presence ofnumerous whole or partially articulated skeletons in a 30 ern thick bone bed in these two quarries suggests a quick in situ burial of a Dockum community in consequence of a catastrophic event such as a flash flood . Quarry 1 and Quarry 2 represent two distinct age groups of the Dockum populations. In Quarry I most of the taxa represent adult forms whereas in Quarry 2 juvenile or small -sized animals were dominant. The associated nature of the skeletons indicate that they were not sorted by hydraulic action. This distinct size difference between two quarries may indicate different niches or segregations between young and adult groups, and may suggest seasonal reproduction and gregarious habits . Chatterjee speculated on the mode of life of Malerisaurus in the Triassic environment. Malerisaurus is comparable to modem bipedal lizards in size, proportions, and inferred activities. It was essentially a land-dweller and probably lived most of the time on the margins of rivers, lakes, and ponds. However, it could possibly climb trees or take to the water like the modem basilisk when alarmed. The diet probably consisted of small clams, snails and insects or anything it could swallow whole, as is evident from the dentition. In my previous paper , I discussed in detail the affinities of Malerisaurus with other primitive diapsids and concluded that this genus is closely allied to Protorosaurus, Tanystropheus, Macrocnemus, Prolacerta, and Tanytrachelos to form the suborder Prolacertiformes. Kadimakara , a new Prolacerta-like genus from the early Triassic of Queensland, Australia , should be added to this group. Wild independently came to a similar conclusion on the basis of restudy of Tanystropheus. He grouped Prolacerta, Macrocnemus, Tanystropheus, and Protorosaurus within the suborder Prolacertiformes. However, he considered Prolacertiformes as squamates. Gow , Carroll , and Evans pointed out that neither Prolacerta nor any of its allies are squamates regardless of the configuration of the cheek. The loss of the lower temporal arcade does not necessarily indicate squamate affinity. Clearly this feature evolved independently in many diverse diapsid groups including Prolacerta , Gephyrosaurus , sphenodontids , nothosaurs , and millerettids . The primitive squamate features, such as short cervicals, ossified sternum, and anteriorly fenestrate scapulo-coracoid, are lacking in Prolacertiformes, and consequent- ly this group is considered herein as non-squamate diapsid. It appears that during the Permian and Triassic periods, these small reptiles occupied niches that were subsequently taken by the squamates in the Jurassic and later times. Protorosaurus and Malerisaurus have been placed in the same family, Protorosauridae . At that time, the nature of the cheeks of these two genera was uncertain because of incomplete material, and it was assumed that the lower temporal arcade in both genera was complete. In contrast, the Prolacertidae has an open cheek. On the basis ofnew evidence, I now think that both of my earlier assumptions were wrong. The present study clearly indicates that in Malerisaurus the lower temporal arcade has been breached. This contention is further supported by another line The genus Protorosaurus is one ofthe earliest known fossil reptiles, being first recorded in 1706 from the Permian deposits of Thuringia, Germany. It was studied by many eminent paleontologists including von Meyer, Cuvier, Owen, and Huxley. Seeley described the animal and reconstructed the skull as a diapsid with an open cheek. The systematic position of Protorosaurus has been debated for over a century because the structure of the skull-and especially the structure of the temporal region-has never been satisfactorily described. Recently Dr. Rupert Wild has prepared new material of Protorosaurus and kindly provided me with the following information. \"The skull JVP 6, December 1986 is diapsid with reduced lower temporal bar.

Kadimakara , a new Prolacerta-like genus from the early Triassic of Queensland, Australia , should be added to this group. Wild independently came to a similar conclusion on the basis of restudy of Tanystropheus. He grouped Prolacerta, Macrocnemus, Tanystropheus, and Protorosaurus within the suborder Prolacertiformes. However, he considered Prolacertiformes as squamates. Gow , Carroll , and Evans pointed out that neither Prolacerta nor any of its allies are squamates regardless of the configuration of the cheek. The loss of the lower temporal arcade does not necessarily indicate squamate affinity.

Protorosaurus and Malerisaurus have been placed in the same family, Protorosauridae . At that time, the nature of the cheeks of these two genera was uncertain because of incomplete material, and it was assumed that the lower temporal arcade in both genera was complete. In contrast, the Prolacertidae has an open cheek. On the basis ofnew evidence, I now think that both of my earlier assumptions were wrong. The present study clearly indicates that in Malerisaurus the lower temporal arcade has been breached. This contention is further supported by another line The genus Protorosaurus is one ofthe earliest known fossil reptiles, being first recorded in 1706 from the Permian deposits of Thuringia, Germany. It was studied by many eminent paleontologists including von Meyer, Cuvier, Owen, and Huxley. Seeley described the animal and reconstructed the skull as a diapsid with an open cheek. The systematic position of Protorosaurus has been debated for over a century because the structure of the skull-and especially the structure of the temporal region-has never been satisfactorily described. Recently Dr. Rupert Wild has prepared new material of Protorosaurus and kindly provided me with the following information. \"The skull JVP 6, December 1986 is diapsid with reduced lower temporal bar.

This measure raises the question of the validity of the name Prolacertiformes. The name Protorosauria Huxley, 1871, has a clear priority over Prolacertiformes Camp, 1945 , in referring to Protorosaurus and its allies , and can be retained as an order within the primitive diapsids. Carroll recommended a similar taxonomic scheme for this group of reptiles. The taxon Eosuchia is in fact a \"catch-all\" suborder for primitive diapsid reptiles of uncertain relationship.

{"text": "They remained positive to this light until the excess\" of drganic waste products in the medium grew so great that all died. The tendency of carbon dioxide to produce positive phototaxis seems to be the only factor in the relationship between he chemical content of the water and phototaxis that is likely to be of importance in the normal movements of Daphnia. Yerkes states that some individuals of Daphnia pulex may be made temporarily weakly negative to light by mechanical stimulation, such as picking them up in a pipette, but with many individuals he failed to obtain this result. I have been unable to produce negative phototaxis by any amount of gentle or rough handling, either by picking the animals up in a pipette or by shaking the dish. Daphnids exposed in the darkroom to weak horizontal light from a 50 watt Edison lamp at 50 cm. distance, with observations taken each hour for 30 hours, gave no evidence of a change in phototaxis corresponding in any way to a daily period. Neither could such a change be detected in daphnids exposed for 24 hours to the same weak light before beginning the series of observations. In no experiment is there found the least evidence for believing in the existence of any sort of a rhythm in phototaxis independent of the direct effect of recurrent external changes. When daphnids which have been kept some time in darkness are suddenly exposed to light of any intensity coming from a horizontal direction there is a tendency for them to go to the bottom of the dish . Conversely, when daphnids which have been exposed to light of any intensity are placed in complete darkness they show a tendency to rise to the top of the dish. A tendency to positive geotaxis is also found on changing from weak light to stronger light , or from moderately •strong light to the light from an electric arc . There is also a tendency of this kind on changing from shade to sunlight . Negative geotaxis is produced by the reverse •change in each of these cases. The tendency to go to the bottom on increase of light intensity cannot be due to a decrease of locomotor activity as it has been shown by Yerkes that the locomotor activity increases with increase of light intensity. Neither can it be due to a change of phototaxis because it takes place when the light comes from a horizontal direction. Further, it can be observed that following a great increase of light intensity many of the animals swim directly downwards with the head pointed toward the bottom of the dish. It seems that we have to do here with a change of some sort in the orientation of the animals to the force of gravity. The tendency to move upward following a decrease of intensity is also well marked and must also be due to a change in the reaction of the animals to gravity. Proof that the reversal of geotaxis by changes in light intensity is independent of phototaxis is given in Experiment 11. Here the daphnids remained at the bottom of the dish when exposed to the light from an arc light, no matter whether the light was falling from the side or at an angle of 45 degrees from above or below. When exposed to weak light following the exposure to the arclight the daphnids showed a strong upward tendency indicating that the effect on geotaxis in this case was undoubtedly due to the light intensity. EQUATION Experiment 12 is presented to show that the vertical distribution remains altered for a long time after reduction of light intensity. March 28, 8.30 A.M., 10 Daphnia pulex from laboratory aquarium at a temperature of 18.5° C. placed in a 29 cm. high jar marked off into five divisions. Exposed to diffuse light of laboratory. Cooled to 13° C. We have shown that in Daphnia pulex increase of light intensity causes a tendency toward positive geotaxis, while decrease of intensity causes a tendency toward negative geotaxis. This tendency seems to be stronger the greater the change in intensity. It seems also that these tendencies are persistent for a considerable length of time. On heating Daphnia pulex in the dark to a temperature of about 25° C. there is a strong tendency for the animals to go to the bottom of the dish . On cooling them to a temperature of about 15° C. there is a tendency for them to go to the surface . The position of these animals kept in the dark was determined by turning on a weak light and taking the observation before the position of the animals could change. The tendency to go down on heating cannot be due to the effect of temperature on the locomQtor activity, because it will be shown in a later section that increase of temperature causes an increase of locomotor activity which would tend to cause the animals to move upwards. Neither can this tendency be due to any effect of light because the tendency is present in the complete absence of light. Seemingly it is due to a change in the orientation of the animals with respect to gravity. We may then suppose that the tendency to move upward on cooling is also due to a change in the relation of the animals to the force of gravity. In horizontal light the same effect of temperature on geotaxis is found . March 19, 8 A.M., 10 Daphnia pulex from 14 hours in darkness placed in a 29 cm. high jar marked off into three divisions. Kept in complete darkness except when making observations. Temperature 21° C. Heated to 26° C. 9.00 2 0 8 9.30 0 0 10 10.00 0 2 8 11.00 0 3 7 12.00 M. 0 1 9 1.00 P.M. 12 7 2.00 1 1 8 3.00 0 1 9 4.00 0 2 8 5.00 0 0 10 6.00 1 1 8 Averages at 21° C: 2.5 3 0 4.5 Averages at 26° C: 0 The normal vertical position of daphnids exposed to horizontal light or to darkness will be determined, first by the geotaxis, which will vary with the light intensity and the temperature; and second, by the rate of locomotor activity, which will also vary with the light intensity and with the temperature. The relations of these factors is very complex, especially in view of the fact that the previous exposure to light and heat must be taken into account. Experiments 13 and 14 show that the tendency to go down on heating and up on cooling is persistent for a number of hours. In general, high temperatures produce in Daphnia pulex a tendency to positive geotaxis, while low temperatures produce a tendency to negative geotaxis. These tendencies persist for at leasta considerable length of time. Oxygen: No definite change in vertical distribution could be observed on changing daphnids from water saturated with oxygen to water from which the oxygen had been driven off by boiling or by the reverse change. Carbon dioxide: Carbon dioxide gas was bubbled for half an hour through a jar of tap water and this was then supposed to contain an extra amount of the chemical in solution. How ever, no change in the vertical distribution could ,be observed on changing daphnids into this water or back into normal tap water. Food: No experiments were conducted on the effect of food as a factor affecting geotaxis, but it is probably not of importance in this respect. Waste: One experiment was performed on the effect of waste materials on geotaxis. A very large number of daphnids were placed together in a tall sealed glass jar in the darkroom with weak horizontal light. The crowding was so great that all the adults had died before the end of 24 hours. During this time no change in geotaxis could be observed so it seems that organic waste products have little effect on geotaxis. In so far as these observations and inferences are conclusive we find that changes in the chemical content of the medium have little effect on the geotaxis of the adults of Daphnia pulex. It could not be determined that mechanical stimulation has any effect on the geotaxis of these daphnids. If such an effect is present it is either very weakly marked or is very temporary and can have little value in determining the vertical movements of the animals. A number of experiments were performed to determine if the geotaxis varies at different times during the day. The method used was to place a number of daphnids in a tall jar marked off into five divisions. The jar was completely filled with water and the top sealed by a glass stopper. In the darkroom the jar of animals was exposed to weak horizontal light. A count was made each hour of the number of individuals in each division of the jar, during a period of 30 hours. No periodicity in vertical distribution could be found, either in daphnids taken from daylight at the beginning of the experiment or in daphnids previ©usly exposed to weak light for a day or more. We may then conclude that there is no diurnal rhythm of geotaxis in this species, except that dependent upon rhythmical change in the external physical factors. Daphnids under natural conditions assume a position in the water with the head pointing upward. When no locomotor movements are being made the drag of the antennae on the water, as the weight of the body pulls the animal down, causes the daphnids to assume this posision. When strokes are made with the antennae the tendency then is to raise the animal vertically through the water. The rate of sinking of adult daphnids 3 to 4 millimeters long with expanded antennae is stated by Birge to be at the rate of 20 to 30 centimeters per minute. Young daphnids 1 millimeter or less in length sink much more slowly at the rate of 5 to 10 centimeters per minute. This slower rate of sinking makes it much easier for the young daphnids to remain near the surface than it is for the adults. It will be seen that it requires a-certain rate of activity to maintain an individual at any certain height in the water. If the locomotor activity increases there will be a tendency for the animal to move to higher levels while a decrease of activity will allow it to sink. Yerkes has shown that an increase of light intensity increases the speed of locomotion in Daphnia pulex. It can easily be observed that on a great increase of light intensity there is a decided increase of activity. The increase of locomotor activity caused by increase of light intensity will have a tendency to cause the daphnids to move upwards, while a decrease of intensity slows down their activity and allows them to sink to lower levels. In studying the effect of temperature on locomotor activity a number of experiments were performed to determine the speed of motion toward a weak light at various temperatures. This method is not very satisfactory because the change in temperature causes changes in the phototaxis as well as in the locomotor activity and it is difficult to separate the effects of the two factors. Further, different individuals give very different and often contradictory results. The number of animals used in the averages is too small to give very great accuracy in conclusions. However, it is thought that some of the relations between temperature and rate of activity are indicated. The method used was to mark off transverse unes 10 centimeters apart on the bottom of a glass dish. In the darkroom a 50 watt Edison lamp was placed 25 centimeters horizontally from each end of the dish. A daphnid was then introduced into the dish and allowed to swim toward one light. As soon as the animal passed the line marked off on that end of the dish this light was turned off and at the same time the light at the other end of the dish turned on. An observation consisted of 8 trips, 4 each way, of the animal across the dish. The time was recorded in minutes and seconds. In comparing the effects of change of temperature two dishes were used with the water kept at the different temperatures. Then the animals were gently shifted from one to the other by a large pipette. In Experiment 16 each individual shows a decided increase of speed of travel toward a weak light on first raising the temperature 5 degrees. The averages for five individuals are 4' 02\" at normal temperature and 2' 46\" after heating. Also, the averages of all the observations show a higher rate of speed at the higher temperature. This effect is produced in spite of the fact that the phototaxis is lessened by the increase of temperature. In this case then we have a definite increase of locomotor activity by increase of temperature. 1' 3' 4' 3' 55\" 05\" 00\" 40\" 05\" ?", "meta": {"ref_id": "ContentServer.json"}}

A t o p o r~~e l~~s crocidzlzlr-ae is widely distributed on Indo-Malayian shrews of the genus C/,ocidzlm : Crocidur.a nzonticola Peters, 1870, and C. fi)eticEn Peters, 1870 from southwestern Borneo , C. mal~rycrncr Robinson and Kloss, 191 1 from wcst Malaysia, C. beatus Millel; 19 10, C. gr~ayi Dobson, 1890 , and C. mindor-us Miller, 1910 , all Philippine ende~nics . I.AXONOMIC NOTES. A~O~O M Z~/ L~S crocidume is more similar to A topomelzw talpae Fain, Lulzosclius and Cauwenberge, 1973 than to tlie species I<nown frorn Erinaceidae. In males of these two species, the postscapular shield is without ornamentation, the opisthonotal surface posterior to the hysteronotal shield is unornamented, the opistliosonial venter is sparsely covered by scales laterally, trochanter IV laclzs a dorsal spur, and its ventral spur is bil~urcate; in females, tlie hysteronotum is covered by numerous scales, which are longer than wide, tlie genital papillar I-ernnants are separated, and the distal part of the sperliiatheca is not inflated. These species differ from each other by the following characters. In botli sexes ofA. crocidurue, seta la is absent on all tarsi, setaJ'of tarsus 11 is filiform; in males, tlie hysteronotal shield is trapezoidal in shape, with a pair of rounded unsclerotized patches near the bases of setae d2, setae e2 are microsetae, setae ps2 are absent, fe~iiur-genu IV has two ventral spurs, the ventral spur of trochanter IV has two points unequal in length, tarsus IV has two unequal apical points; in females, the postscapular shield is rectangular, with a deep and wide posterior median incision; it is covered by a scale-like pattern, sctac 40 are situated 011 the fused sclei-otized areas of coxae IV, they are subequal in length to sctae g. I11 botli sexes of A. talpae, seta la is present on tarsi I and 11, setaf'of tarsus 11 is inflated; in males, the liysteronotal shield is mushroom-shaped, without the discernible non sclerotized patches, setae e2 are macrosetae, subequal in length to e l , setae ps2 are present, femur-genu 1V is without any spurs, tlie ventral spur of tl-ochanter IV has two subequal points, tarsus IV has two subequal apical points; in females, the postscapular shield is triangular, witli a strongly sclerotized ~ncdian band, setae 4u are situated on the soft cuticle between tlie sclerotized areas of coxae IV and are almost 2 times longer than setae g.

Lis11*0pho1*oides lieuneyi sp.11. differs from all other species of the subgenus, except for L. npon~jn sp.n., by the presence in both sexes of sclerotized bands bordering the lateral rnargins of the postscapular shield. Males of this species differ from all other species by the presence of a pair of pregenital sclerites, and by the hypertrophied posterior ends of the supporting sclerite of the aedeagus. This species is closest to L. UpOnZJLS sp.n. and differs by the following characters. In L. henneyi, pregenital sclerites are present, the posterior ends of the aedeagal-supporting sclerite are hypertrophied, and femur IV is about 1.6 times wider than femur 111. In males of L. al~o1,oni)1s, pi-egenital sclerites are absent, the posterior ends of the aedeagal-supporting sclerite are not hypertrophied, and feinur IV is about 2 times wider than femur Ill. Females of these species cannot be unambiguously distinguished from each other. Females of L. uponiys from the type host differ slightly from L. heuneyi by the shape of the hystcronotal shield. In females of L. apo,ol?zys, the width of thc hysteronotal shield at the level of setae e2-e2 is 1.3-1.5 tinles longer than the width of this shield at the level of setae d l -d l .

This species is a specific parasite of the New Philippine endemic, Bullimtis gunzuy Rickart, Meaney and Tabaraiiza, 2002. TAXONOMIC NOTES. This species along with L. 1~izorzicu.s. sp.n., and L. cor.yz~zrarosae sp.n. form a colnplex of closely related species. The most notable differential character of the complex is the presence in its representatives of a well developed apical protrusion on tarsus 1. These three species possess the following combination of characters. In both sexes, the postscapular shield is without ornamentation or with indistinct lines; in males, the hysteronotal shield is without ornaruentation or with indistinct lines in the anterior part, the scales are absent posterior to setae e2, setae h3 are 75-90 long, the anterior ends of an aedeagal-supporting sclerite are fused to each other; in fetilales, the hysteronotal shield is completely covered by a scale-like pattern and folds, the distance el-el is about 1.5-2 times longer than the distance el-posterior tnargin of the hysteronotal shield; coxae 111 are without transverse lines. Among other species of the subgenus, thc species of this complex are similar to L. do~on~rnator Fain 1976 , from murids from Sulawesi and L. I~rtiventl-u Fain, 198 1, from Sundanzjis nzt~elleri from west Malaysia and southeast Borneo. The mites fsom BziAin~us spp. differ from them by the distinct ornamentation of the hystcronotal shield in females, and also differ from L. dominator In both sexes by the strongly developed expansion of genu I and the more elongated idiosoma.

{"text": "This is a count of arcs connecting one element to another. This number is somewhat biased by the number of elements. The \"Average Fan-out factor\" is the average number of elements that can follow another. The value of 7.76 for museum labels means that on average any element can be followed by any 7 different elements. Variability within elements: Dictionary aided classification is usually unavailable in herbaria label data set. In Address problems, the proper name is an open class but the other elements are much more finite. The number of states, cities within a state and roads within a city are finite. In contrast, there are on the order of 1.5 million scientific names. The International Plant Name Index contains many thousands of entries but is far from complete particularly for older names that have been replaced yet appeared on museum labels. There are also variations in spelling because of human error or changes in nomenclatural rules. The list of all Collectors is also exceedingly long and labels do not follow any single authority. The location where a specimen was found is also an open class. It includes descriptions of locations, e.g. \"300 meters NNW of the last rapids on Stanley Falls, Belgium Congo\". The museum domain is much more complex than the address problem as showed above and information extraction accuracy using the previously developed methods are inadequate. In this section we discuss methods we have used to enhance performance by extending the methods used for previous data sets. The goal of the learning phase of machine learning is to use representative examples to develop models that can, when presented with novel input, create proper classification of the input. Our first training data consists 200 digitized OCR records from the Yale Peabody Herbarium with multiple label formats randomly selected from the typed labels which requiring 10,095 element classifications. The HERBIS Learning System is part of the overall HERBIS system. Museums anywhere in the world can create digital images of their specimens on their site. These images can be passed to the Yale Peabody Museum OCR processing unit where the label is detected and converted to a string sequence. This text packet is sent to HLS at UIUC though a web services connection. The text is converted to an XML document with appropriate information labeled and returns them to the end user. Other image handling services such as MorphBank can call the classification programs directly. HLS uses a modified Hidden Markov Model. The HMM algorithm is discussed elsewhere . The HMM induces a probability distribution on sequences of symbols. The HMM model is an order-preserving algorithm. There are three canonical problems associated with HMM could be solved by different algorithms. One of them is useful in information extraction context. Given the output sequence , find the most likely sequence of hidden states that could have generated a given output sequence. In other words, given the word sequence , find the most likely sequences of element ,sp,sa). This problem is solved by the Viterbi algorithm. A Naïve Bayes model is a probability model based on conditional probabilities. The NB model makes predictions based on the probability distribution of features from the training set. The NB algorithm uses the distribution information to calculate the probabilities that a new instance belonging to the classes. The example would then be classified to the highest probability class. For computational efficiency NB assumes that each feature is conditionally independent of every other feature . This \"independent\" assumption greatly simplifies the model but the assumption is far from accurate in many cases. However, the overall classifier works surprisingly well in practice . The NB calculations are imbedded in part of the HMM algorithm. In order to show the HMM performance comparing to others, we also implemented a nonordered algorithm NB as the baseline and then present of series of extension to HMM below. The following example used the training data that was enhanced by including both the original OCR errors in the training set plus examples where the OCR errors were hand corrected. The difference from this correction is small so we only present the difference between HMM and NB on 41 elements that occur more than 20 times in the training set . There is a set of elements in our dataset which we call \"field element identifiers\" . Some elements of some data labels are preceded by a string to identify the information that follows. For example, the term \"Legit\" in the string \"Legit A. H. Curtiss\" or \"No.\" in \"No. 503\" in Figure 1 . In the museum label training data and machine learning output, we mark these with a terminal \"L\", e.g. COL, LOL , HBL . Those label elements usually indicate that there is respectively a CO, LC, HB element following it, except in cases of missing data and alignment errors. Rather than training the HMM algorithm to extract the Darwin Core elements and treat these other elements as NS, we train the algorithms to recognize the field element identifiers as well. Our result shows that those label elements improve the ML overall 4%. Figure 3 presents the detailed performance differences between with label encoding in the schema and without those field element identifiers. It is very difficult to improve the performance the ML without large numbers of training examples . Unfortunately, it is very expensive to get botanists to create these examples because creating the training examples from the raw OCR output is very time consuming. The analysis above indicated that the performance difference between the USPS address and HERBIS collection are mainly attributable to the relative homogeneity in the format of the USPS addresses. There may be thousands of different formats of labels that have evolved over the last couple hundred years and now reside in museum collections. However, each collector has their own preferred format of label. This means that a particular museum will tend to have a relatively finite number of collectors supplying the museum at any one time and therefore will have a finite number of label formats represented in the collection. Further, if many museums are digitizing labels, then eventually, there will be corrected sets of labels for many collectors. It may be possible to develop multiple training modules each of which specializes in a particular collector and therefore label format. This observation leads to the hypotheses that the specialist model will perform better for records by the same author than for a generalized model trained on a random data collection and That fewer training examples will be required to reach a given level of performance using all labels from the same collector than would be required for a mixed collection of collectors. These hypotheses are supported in the results of the experiment below. HLS includes the following Specialist Bootstrapping Architecture . Rather than following the standard machine learning model of creating training data >> generate model >> deploy model, we design a model where multiple museums could use available models to classify their data but as part of their workflow when they correct the machine learning data to put into their own database those examples are added to a new training pool. This pool can be subdivided into sub-collections to construct new specialist models . When the end-user sends a museum image to the server, the server would perform OCR, classify based on collector and then process the document with the appropriate collector or collection model. If a specialized collector module is not contained in the server, the information will be extracted from the label using the generic model based on a random sample of labels . For this strategy to work, it is necessary to be able to categorize labels into subsets prior to the information extraction step so that the highest performance model could be used for extraction. A Naïve Bayes pre-classifier can successfully perform this task. The 200 generic Yale training set includes 15 records from the collector \"A. H. Curtiss\". The 5-fold evaluation of NB classifier trained to differentiate \"Curtiss\" from \"non-Curtiss records\" preformed well, F-Score of 97.5%. Bootstrapping is a process where a small number of examples are used to create a weak learning model. This learning model, while weak is used to process a new set of examples. When a museum staff member corrects the output, it can be added to their database. The new result can help to form a stronger model. There are fewer errors generated by this new model making it easier for the users to correct the model's errors. Museum staff who digitize records need to perform this step for key fields in any case in order to import the records to their database. These corrected examples are fed back into the process again to create an even stronger model. Successive generations of examples improve performance making it easier for the users to generate more examples. A user wishing to create their own specialized model could begin by processing a set of labels from one collector through the generic Yale model. With each iteration the performance of the specialist system would improve but initially the generic model would perform better, with fewer errors per record. At some crossover point, the performance of the specialized model would exceed that of the generic model. In the example below the crossover point is at about 80 examples. In this framework the user only needs to correct machine output for 80 records to create a model that performs as well as a random collection of 200 records. This crossover point is what the algorithm is looking for in Phase 2 step 7 below. Specialist Learning Algorithm --The steps could be described as follows: Phase 1 1. Developers create a \"generic\" model alpha, M 0 . This experiment compares the specialist model and the generic model generated from Yale 200 example collection. The dashed top line in figure 6 is the performance of 200 records independent of iteration. Regular expressions were applied to the 20,000 Yale digitized labels to identify the approximately 100 examples with the collector's name \"A. H. Curtiss\" who is a well-known collector and botanist. HLS was trained on 10 examples and then 5-fold evaluation used to measure the F-Score. This procedure was repeated 10 times, adding 10 new labels on each iteration producing a training set of 20, 30 and so on until a hundred were used in a training set. The results are presented in the solid curved line, \"Specialist Model.\" ", "meta": {"ref_id": "Greenbergetal."}}

{"text": "Among the 121 sentences, part of them were used as the training set for feature extraction and model building, and the remainder were used for evaluation. We applied the Stanford parser for parsing and chunking in the NLP phase. This step was to prepare for the machine learning part. The parsing of context sentences generated candidate features for machine learning, and when combined with features and relation labels we were able to then conduct training to derive a classifier for relations. A decision tree was the algorithm for selecting features and generating patterns for different types of relations. The resultant classifier was then ready for accepting new context for tag pairs and outputting relations. Finally, we examined the methodology by sending new tag pairs to the trained model. We withheld the other context sentences as a testing set, and input the sentences to the NLP processor and classifier accordingly. The classifier returned the relation of each tag pair as an automatic relation extraction result. Since we had the human coded results, we compared them with the machine learning results and evaluated the performance. Our preliminary experiment extracted 2401 unique features from 121 context sentences. We used a ten-fold cross-validation to evaluate the result . The evaluation result of our method displayed in Table 3 shows an 83.72% rate of correct classification / tag relation instances. While the sampling size of tag data and the number of human coded relations could not be as large as we would have liked, this approach appears to be a promising methodology. The introduction of external sources allows for objectively identifying contextual information for context-less tag data and thereby improving the accuracy and reliability of relation extraction. This result also suggests that using external sources for context information can help detect data anomalies in the tag pairs that have a high MI score. We discovered from our experiment that a high MI score did not necessarily mean that Tag X and Tag Y always had direct semantic relations. Some tag pairs did not appear in any sentence in Google search results and no context was found containing the tags. For example, the two tags Tag X = \"all rights reserved\" and Tag Y = \"Canon EOS 350\" had a high MI score, but neither of these two tags appeared together in Google search results; this suggests that no context sentence existed for the two tags. We are unsure at present how the two tags might be related, but it is possible that they are indirectly related. If, for example, they are both related to a third tag in a meaningful way, then they could be related to each other statistically but not semantically. Consequently, the two tags were semantically unrelated and the pair was removed from the tag pair collection to ensure the meaningfulness of tags and their relations. We also discovered that NLP algorithms can provide flexible and powerful features for relation identification. For instance, a syntax level feature can be helpful for identifying the \"is-locatedin\" class in an example pattern such as Tag X , Tag Y , Zip Code or Tag X prep Tag Y , where Tag X could be a city name and Tag Y a state name. The NLP algorithms then can be expanded and explored with more semantic feature types and other machine learning algorithms. Tags are a special type of subject metadata as well as a rich, powerful vocabulary source. Extracting relations between tags is the first step toward automatic subject metadata creation. An important contribution of this study was the introduction of external resources as a solution to the problem of context-less tag data. Through combining NLP and machine learning techniques we developed a set of algorithms and procedures for automatically processing the external resources, using the output to provide more objective, reliable context information for tag relation extraction. The methodology developed in this study can be applied to larger-scale research in the future as well as in research fields beyond tag relation extraction. For example, the processing and categorization of unstructured text can benefit from this methodology, as can automatic construction of an ontology and controlled vocabulary, as well as automatic mapping between tags and controlled vocabularies. The results of our approach are encouraging for tag relation extraction. We plan to improve the classifier by collecting more relation types and human-coded examples for future experiments, and eventually utilize the relations extracted to enhance subject metadata descriptions. Wikipedia defines a Tag as a 'free-text keyword' and Tagging as an 'indexing process for assigning tags to resources'. A Folksonomy is described as a shared collection of tags used on a certain platform. The term folksonomy defines a user-generated and distributed classification system, emerging through bottom-up consensus . Folksonomies became popular on the Web with social software applications such as social bookmarking, photo sharing and weblogs. A number of social tagging sites such as del.icio.us, Flickr , YouTube , CiteULike have become popular. Commonly cited advantages of folksonomies are their flexibility, rapid adaptability, free-forall collaborative customisation and their serendipity . People can in general use any term as a tag without exactly understanding the meaning of the terms they choose. The power of folksonomies stands in the aggregation of tagged information that one is interested in. This improves social serendipity by enabling social connections and by providing social search and navigation . The simplicity and ease of use of tagging however, lead to problems with current folksonomy systems . The problems can be classified in two: • Local variations: Tags have little semantics and many variations. Thus, even if a tagging activity can be considered as the user's cognitive process, the resulting set of tags does not always correctly and consistently represent the user's mental model. • Distributed variations: Most tagging systems have their own specific ways of working with and interpreting the meaning of tags. Thus if we want to aggregate tagging data from different applications or services, it's very difficult to find out the meanings and correlations between a sets of tags. These limitations are due to the lack of a uniform structure and semantic representation found in tagging systems. In this paper, we will compare existing conceptualisations of tagging activities and folksonomies, to assess their merits and thus contribute to future work in this area. Such a conceptualisation, or ontology, is intended to be used in the representation of tagging data in collaborative tagging systems. This paper begins by discussing the reasons why we need Semantic Web technologies for tagging communities. We then briefly overview existing conceptual models for tagging and propose a novel model for folksonomies. We continue by introducing existing tag ontologies and compare them using our conceptual model. Finally, we discuss the results, draw conclusions, and suggest future research areas. There have been a significant number of efforts to add more structure and semantics to conventional tagging systems. Approaches to tagging and folksonomies have been dominated by a focus on the analysis of tag usage patterns , information retrieval and navigation and social network analysis and clustering Brooks et al., 2006) based on tagging data. Golder and Herbermann collected del.icio.us data and analysed the structure and usage patterns of tagging systems. Their work discusses the distinction between collaborative tagging and taxonomies -although collaborative tagging systems have many limitations in terms of semantics and structures, it provides the opportunity to learn from one another through sharing and organising information. Marlow found that for certain users, the number of tags can become stable over time, while for others, it keeps growing. Cattuto et. al observed small world effects by analyzing a network structure of folksonomies from Bibsonomy and del.icio.us. Their work introduced the notions of clustering and characteristic path length to describe the small world effects. According to the study, folksonomies exhibit a small world structure and have a sort of social network. carried out a study to construct community-based semantics based on a tripartite model of actors, concepts, and instances. He emphasises the social context for a representation of ontologies and generates the well-known co-occurrence network of ontology learning as well as a novel semantic network based on community relationships using del.icio.us data. There are a number of debates on the merits of folksonomies when compared to ontologies and other structured vocabulary and classification systems. Despite noted differences between folksonomies and ontologies , Semantic Web technologies can be regarded as a complement to folksonomies. As free-text keywords, tags do not have exact meanings and succumb to linguistic ambiguities and variations including the human error factor. While a user may interpret a tag's semantics through using or reading it, computers cannot automatically understand the meaning, since it is not defined in a machine-readable way . Folksonomy systems do not provide a uniform way to share, exchange, and reuse tagging data among users or communities . With the use of tagging systems in constant increase, these limitations will become evermore critical. As a potential solution, Specia and Motta propose the integration of folksonomies and ontologies to enrich tag semantics. In particular, Gruber and Spivack emphasise the need for folksonomies and ontologies to work together. In general, tag ontologies can contribute in the following three areas: • Knowledge Representation Sophistication: A tag ontology can robustly represent entities and relationships that shape tagging activities. It could make the knowledge structure of tagging data explicit and facilitate the Linked Data of tagging data on the Web. • Facilitation of Knowledge Exchange: Ontologies enable knowledge exchange among different users and applications by providing reusable constructs. Thus, a tag ontology can be shared and used for separate tagging activities on different platforms. • Machine-processable. Ontologies and Semantic Web technologies in general expose human knowledge to machines in order to perform automatic data linking and integration of tagging data. Before providing a detailed comparison, we start by reviewing individual conceptual models of tagging activities that preceded our own. A tagging model needs to distinguish between entities in a tagging activity that need to be represented, and address the relationships that exist between them. After reviewing existing tagging models we discuss whether the proposed models are suitable to represent collaborative tagging activities. We then propose our extended model, which caters for the collaborative aspect of folksonomies. Many researchers Halpin, 2006; Cattuto, 2007 ) suggested a tripartite model of tagging activities. Although different authors interpret the term \"tagging\" differently, we can identify three common entities -users, tags, and resources. They form a triple that represents the Tagging Process: Tagging: ------------------------------------------------- where U is the set of users who participate in a tagging activity, T is the set of available tags and R is the set of resources being tagged. Gruber suggested an extension to model : Tagging: ------------------------ where object, tag, and tagger correspond to R, T, and U in the tripartite model. The source refers to the tag space where the tagger applies the set of tags whereas the positive/negative parameter is an attempt to represent the collaborative filtering of 'bad' tags from spammers. This tagging model has successfully been used for representing the tagging process at a semantic level. In fact, most tag ontologies have a Tagging class, based on Gruber's model, as a core concept. Existing models consider tagging as an activity where an individual user assigns a set of tags to a resource. While they provide effective ways to describe the tagging process, they do not really support collaborative tagging activities. We therefore want to provide a Folksonomy Model to represent this knowledge, where the folksonomy is considered as a collection of instances of the tagging model. Before doing so, we need to clarify the differences between simple and folksonomy-based tagging practices. Folksonomies are not created independently by individuals in isolation, but collectively by people who participate in the collaborative tagging activity. Thus, the folksonomy model has to cover all the collaborative aspects and relationships in addition to the objects associated with tagging activities. A straightforward model for a Folksonomy could be defined as follows: , user group, source, occurrence) ---------------------- where the tag set is the set of all tags being employed, the user group is a set of users who participate in the tagging activity and the source is the location where the folksonomy is utilised . The fourth parameter, occurrence, plays an important role to identify the tags' popularity. Comparing this model to the tagging model , we can identify the following similarities: the resources are not part of the Folksonomy model per se. The Folksonomy is rather applied to the collective tagging process of the resources. The tag and tagger parameters in have been replaced with a collective representation of these entities -tag set and user group. The source is still unique since a folksonomy is a multi-user approach to tagging on a single platform. In our opinion, filtering should not be represented at this level. Alternatively, given we represent multiple tags in this model, the frequencies of individual tags become important. Thus, we include the occurrence as our fifth parameter. Folksonomy: by extending to make the individual tagging activities explicit: Folksonomy: ---------------- where the last parameter reflects the collective tagging processes performed by the users of the folksonomy, where an individual tagging process is represented by: Tagging: ------------------------------------------------------ where object, tag and tagger have the same semantics as those in . Thus, our Folksonomy model now incorporates a representation for the collective tagging processes that are individually defined by the Tagging model . There is no simple criterion for the comparison of tag ontologies. For this reason, we briefly compare the tag ontologies with respect to their suitability for: • representing tagging activities and tagging data • representing features of folksonomies We will compare seven conceptualisations, keeping in mind the folksonomy model we proposed in Section 3.2. In particular, we include in our comparison a conceptualisation that we presented in our earlier work -the SCOT Ontology . The choice of the conceptualisations was based on how concrete the model is for tagging and use by online communities. Although a lot of work in analyzing folksonomies has been done in social theory and information retrieval, very few tag ontologies have been reported until today. Few 132 researchers have explicitly specified conceptualisations of tagging data in a formal language. Concerning our selection, at the time of this research only 6 of the 7 conceptualisations were actually proposed as ontologies and described in a dedicated representation language . Although Gruber's model is just defined conceptually, we include it in our comparison since many research papers have cited his model and some ontologies have been developed based on this model. The selection of ontologies we include in our comparison is shown in Table 1 . Some of the selected conceptualisations better suit the first criterion we have defined at the beginning of this section , whereas others are better suited to the second criterion . However, all conceptualisations are suitable for both criterions to varying degrees. We will now have a brief look at them individually. Gruber's work is an early attempt to conceptualise tagging activities. His model can be viewed as a first step towards a general applicable representation model for tagging. Although his model itself is not an ontology it clearly reveals a generic conceptualisation of tagging. For more details on his work we refer to Gruber describes relationships between an agent, an arbitrary resource, and one or more tags. In this model there are three core concepts such as Tagger, Tagging, and Tag to represent a tagging activity. Knerr provides the tagging concept in the Tagging Ontology and Echarte et. al propose a model for folksonomies . Since their approaches are based on the ideas of Gruber and Newman, the core elements of the ontologies are almost identical. In particular, Echarte's model extends concepts such as time, domain, visibility, type, etc., and is represented by OWL. The SCOT Ontology -Social semantic Cloud of Tags, describes the structure and semantics of tagging data and enables interoperability of tagging data among heterogeneous social websites and tagging applications. Although SCOT's main goal is to represent collaborative tagging activities, it is also suitable for representing the features of folksonomies . MOAT -Meaning of a Tag, is intended for semantic-annotation of content by providing a meaning for free-text tagging. In addition to extensions to the Tag, Tagging, and Tagger concepts from Newman's ontology, MOAT provides the Meaning class to represent custom, user-provided 'meanings' for tags. The Nepomuk Annotation Ontology is provided for annotating resources on the Social Semantic Desktop . It is not entirely dedicated to tagging practices but demonstrates the increasing importance of tagging representation in social systems. Table 1 , given the criteria discussed at the start of this section. Whereas Newman's Ontology is more inclined towards representing tagging data, and Echarte's Ontology towards representing features of folksnomies, SCOT has a higher level of sophistication in both directions. In the next section, we will detail the main entities and features that the six ontologies and Gruber's model are able to represent. We will support our conclusions in this section by exploring the suitability of the individual conceptualisations, vis-à-vis criteria and as set out in the start of this section. We start by listing and comparing the concepts and proceed by listing and comparing their features . In this section we discuss in more details the general comparison we presented in the previous section. First, we will have a look whether the individual conceptualisations are suitable for representing general tagging activities and tagging data. All models have a representation for the object, tag and tagger in our Tagging model and all except NAO have a concept representing the tagging process. In Newman's model, the tagging concept is further refined into tags:RestrictedTagging and tags:Tagging . Echarte et al. provide the Annotation class to represent the tagging activity -i.e., it is the same as tags:Tagging. Thus, the Tagging concept can be considered as a core concept of tag ontologies. Although SCOT and MOAT have different goals compared to others, they also can describe tagging by linking to the tags:Tagging class in Newman's ontology. We now consider whether the ontologies address collective tagging data and provide sufficient features of folksonomies, as described in our Folksonomy model . Some ontologies which are based on Gruber's model have been extended in order to support folksonomies. For instance, Knerr Source class to represent the source. In addition, Knerr allows a user to use foaf:Group alongside foaf:Person to describe the user group. Similarly, NAO allows the user to use nao:Party to represent the user group. MOAT does not have a class for defining it. Nevertheless they are not enough to represent folksonomies at a semantic level. SCOT is consistent with the folksonomy model and provides representations for the source, user group and tag set. In Table 2 we compare the classes provided by these conceptualisations that are relevant to our study. Additionally, we must note that although an ontology might not provide all the required representations, they can act as a \"good Semantic Web citizen\" by connecting to external vocabularies such as SIOC , FOAF , SKOS , or DC to further weave data on the Web. For example, MOAT and SCOT use the SIOC ontology extensively to describe online communities, while other ontologies do not reuse or link to external terms. In particular, although Echarte has its own classes to represent a tagging and a folksonomy, the classes do not have any relations with other RDF vocabularies. While the number of classes enhances taxonomical representations, the power of ontologies lies in the ability of representing relationships between the classes. Although most of the studied ontologies have a similar taxonomical structure, their attributes vary according to their goals and purposes. We will now have a look at the attributes provided by the ontologies, and compare their functionalities. We differ between data type attributes, which relate classes to non-conceptual data , and object type properties which provide relationships between classes. Data Type. Aside from declarative features that represent relationships among users, tags, and resources, a semantic model for folksonomies needs to provide for descriptive features that state non-conceptual values. Most surveyed tag ontologies have many attributes to describe data-type values, i.e. numerical quantities, free-text descriptions, date, time, etc. The data-type properties relevant to this work are summarised in Table 9 . A number of datatype properties are either directly or indirectly reused from the Dublin Core vocabulary. For instance Newman's ontology tags:name is a subproperty of dc:title and tags:taggedOn is a subproperty of dc:date. Only SCOT provides for the description of numerical values for entities, e.g. scot:totalTags refers to the total number of tags in a tag cloud and scot:totalItems refers to the total number of resources tagged with tags in the tag cloud. SCOT also provides properties relating to the frequency of a tag itself. Whereas the simplistic scot:ownAFrequency refers to the actual occurrence of a particular tag in a tag cloud, scot:ownRFrequency represents the percentage frequency of a tag within a particular tag cloud, relative to the total of all tag frequencies in that tag cloud. There are many attributes to describe string and literal values for a specific purpose, e.g. tags:name, tagont:prefTagLabel, nao:preLabel, and ec:hasLabel for describing tag's name. Object Type. The object type properties relevant in the context of this study are summarised in Table 4 . SCOT, Echarte and Knerr provide the possibility to define a tagging activity. In SCOT, there is no local property to describe who is involved in a tagging activity. For this purpose SCOT reuses Newman's tags:taggedBy attribute. Via SCOT one can describe who uses tags via the scot:usedBy property. Meanwhile, three ontologies have the property to identify a location or source in which the tagging occurred. TagOnt provides tagont:hasServiceDomain to link the tagging activity to the ServiceDomain, Echarte provides ec:hasSource with the Source as its range value, whereas SCOT provides scot:tagspace with a range of sioc:Site. The relation between tags and resources is defined via tags:isTagOf , nao:isTagFor , and scot:tagOf properties in theNewman, NAO and SCOT ontologies respectively. They also provide inverse properties for this relation. Defining relations between tags is one of the benefits of using an ontology to model folksonomies, since this effectively gives semantics to tags in a tag set. Nevertheless only SCOT and Newman take advantage of this possibility. Whereas Neman provides very restricted properties such as tags:equivalentTag and tags:relatedTag, SCOT provides many more attributes such as scot:spellingVariant and scot:delimited. The spelling variant property is further refined into scot:acronym, scot:plural, scot:singular and scot:synonym. In addition, the latter has further subproperties to define specific synonym types, i.e. scot:hypenatated, scot:underscored, scot:slashed, and scot:spaced. In comparison to other ontologies, SCOT specifically provides attributes that represent characteristics of folksonomies such as scot:hasUsergroup, scot:createdBy, scot:contains, and scot:taggingActivity. To conclude this section we briefly give a summary of the comparison. So far, tag ontologies have mainly been used for representing tagging activities, and only to a minor extent for modeling the features of folksonomies. According to the Folksonomy model given in Section 3.2, SCOT is suitable for this model. But, we might argue that the surveyed ontologies have different ontological purposes and different expressivity. Therefore, as an ideal solution we might need to interlink among the proposed ontologies. In the first half of this paper we proposed a model for collaborative tagging activities and folksonomies -based on the widely accepted model for tagging. The detailed comparisons presented in Section 4 support several general concluding observations about ontologies related to tagging activities and their usefulness in collaborative tagging systems. This research can be considered as a first attempt to systematically compare different conceptualisations of semantic tagging for collaborative tagging systems. We believe that tag ontologies should be evaluated with respect to a particular goal, application or scenario rather than merely for the sake of an evaluation. Our observations take into consideration two separate criteria -the depth of tagging data per se, and the collaborative aspect in folksonomies. As we mentioned in the start of the paper, tag ontologies are in an early stage and current approaches need to be elaborated or combined to enrich schemas and meet both criteria. Nevertheless the surveyed ontologies already offer an improved opportunity for collaborative tagging systems -especially given the machineprocessable representations that they can provide. Following the comparison of the tag ontologies we arrived at the following conclusions: • There is agreement on the issue as to what are the most elementary building blocks of a model for the tagging. The building blocks consist of the taggers, the tags themselves, and the resources being tagged. • Different individuals create substantially different conceptualisations of tagging data and tagging activities despite the fact that their purposes are similar. • The tag model does not cover overall characteristics of a folksonomy. SCOT, combined Gruber's conceptual model and Newman's vocabularies, is the ontology that must be suitable to represent collaborative tagging activities and it provides the most appropriate representations for the Folksonomy model as we defined it. In addition linking between SCOT and MOAT is useful way to complement to define a meaning of tag. Toward the Semantic Web DCMF: DC & Microformats, a Good Marriage During the Web 1.0 years , the usual method for including semantic information within documents was using the HTML header <meta> elements, as well as <title>, <address>, <link>, <del>, <ins> elements and \"title\" and \"cite\" attributes. This continues in the present, but the abuse and misuse of <meta> elements forces search engines to ignore this information. With the introduction and growing popularity of XML, and the first Recommendation status of W3C's RDF in February 1999 , or, historically, using special user agents like Metabrowser, which allowed the user to browse both the information and the metainformation within a webpage. Microformats originated from a grassroots movement lead by Tantek Çelik to make recognizable data items capable of automated processing by software agents, as well as directly readable by human beings . The official website of microformats.org says that they are \"designed for humans first and machines second, microformats are a set of simple, open data formats built upon existing and widely adopted standards\". A microformat is a Web-based data formatting approach seeking to re-use existing content as metadata, using only X/HTML classes and other attributes for encoding. Microformats are simple conventions for embedding semantic markup in human-readable documents. They make use of implicit and explicit X/HTML characteristics in order to add simple semantic information via: • relationship links using \"rel\" and \"rev\" attributes on <a> and <link> elements. Besides the default defined types of relationship in the HTML specification, they can also be extended using profiles. • \"class\" and \"id\" attributes of most X/HTML elements. In this case, in addition to its support for display , these attributes may be used for other different functionalities. Web developers frequently make use of meaningless values for class names and identifiers. However, source code comprehension can be enhanced and extra information added for instance using \"header\", \"menu\" and \"footer\" for page layout definition. In December 2005 Google did an analysis of a sample of slightly over a billion documents, extracting information about popular class names, elements, attributes, and related metadata. One of the goals of that project was to know if any logic or semantics were used in class names. The conclusion was that there is no uniformity in naming classes. As a consequence, it is hard to parse documents in order to extract semantic information, except when microformats are used. The main goal of microformats is to solve problems created by inconsistent labeling, for instance, defining events, people, relationships, etc. through the creation of simple elements and element sets. Some of the microformat element sets are associated with widely adopted standards or schema, such as hCard and hCalendar ; some others have a newer origin, like \"rel-tag\" microformats, used to simplify blog indexing through Technorati. There are also other globally used microformats such as \"vote-links\" for electronic voting, \"hReview\" for media reviews, \"hResume\" for resumes, and \"XFN\" for social networks, etc. One of the most obvious and important benefits of using microformats -besides easy encoding and quick distribution-is the ability to easily parse web documents to look for microformats and extract them. There are a number of Web services that exploit this semantic information such as: Technorati 28 to find Weblog posts, Upcoming.org 29 to extract hCalendar definitions of events, and Yahoo! Tech 30 publishing of products reviews etc. Yahoo! has also implemented a search engine for Creative Commons licensed documents 31 , and Yahoo! Search parses almost every defined microformat. We started the Dublin Core MicroFormats project in 2005, taking advantage of Dublin Core's versatility, general purpose applicability, its formal standardization and the wide promotion by the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative . Dublin Core is a metadata schema which is syntactic-independent so it is suitable for encoding semantics within a microformats structure. So, DCMF allow us to extend the indisputable advantages of DCMI -simplicity, flexibility, diffusion and appropriateness-to any domain. All of the microformats have been created with a concrete goal, and the general goal of DC Microformats is to describe web resources . But DC microformats are also particularly appropriate to encode bibliographic descriptions of resources, such as magazines, books, articles, in any media, including paper or digital. Let's see an example of how we can describe Tim Berners-Lee's book using semantic information encoded as DCMF. The following code will represent this information in an X/HTML webpage: <dl class=\"dublincore\"> <dt>Title:</dt> <dd class=\"title\">Weaving the Web</dd> <dt>ISBN:</dt> <dd class=\"identifier\">0062515861</dd> <dt>Author:</dt> <dd><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee\" class=\"creator\">Tim Berners-Lee</dd></dl> According to the example, to use DC microformats, we need: 1. An X/HTML element with the class or identifier \"dublincore\", which acts as container of a DC microformat and identifies it. 2. A string which represents the semantic expressed by the microformat . 3. An X/HTML element with the \"class\" or \"id\" attributes, whose value is the appropriate DC element to indicate the semantic information to machines ; and also the value of the element/property . If we declare the information expressed in the microformat in RDF nomenclature , we should speak about: resource, property and value, where: • resource, is the value of the element with \"identifier\" class or id, if it exists; • property, is the value of the class expressed for both; for humans and for machines • and value, is the content of X/HTML elements with the class or identifiers of the last item . There are many tools to extract and/or generate metadata with DCMI elements, but none allows us to create microformats, except Dublin Core Metadata Gen, which was incorporated into the DCMF project. Dublin Core Metadata Gen is an application developed in PHP that generates three kinds of DC metadata: RDF, X/HTML using <meta> elements and also, per the project presented here, DCMF. In Dublin Core Metadata Gen, you can enter the data into a template and get: DC in RDF, DC in X/HTML using <meta> elements, and DC in microformats. The Dublin Core Microformats Viewer is an add-on for Firefox and Flock browsers. This user agent's extension detects DC microformats when is then included in the X/HTML code of the webpage. Like Dublin Core Viewer Extension add-on , DC Microformats Viewer installs a little icon in the status bar, letting the users open a pop-up window containing a table with the Dublin Core microformats present in the current page. This tool is only a simple extension with simple functionality, but it also shows the ease of extracting metainformation from DC microformats, and the potential of this approach. Microformats are another way of expressing metadata in general, and DC in particular, embedded in web resources. If we compare microformats encoding with the use of <meta> elements, and/or with RDF syntax, microformats have some advantages and distinctive characteristics: • Easy to create. Microformats make participation in Web 2.0 social collaboration easier for content creators. Any web content creator can write microformats easily. The only required knowledge is basic X/HTML and X/HTML authoring tools. • Easy to recognize and use. The information can be read by people using their user agents. Users also can extend their browsers' functionalities , to combine pieces of information on websites with applications . There are also disadvantages. Probably microformats are less known than the <meta> element, because microformats belong to the emerging domain of the Web 2.0. Also microformats are more limited than RDF; for example, they can not formally define complex relationships and microformats' scope are narrower that the descriptive potential of RDF. Despite all those limitations, microformats are a way to work with DC metadata in the context of Web 2.0, allowing authors to generate semantic information easily comprehensible to both people and machines. Web services can also be developed to support DC microformats, as for any other existing microformats. Examples might include article repositories, books, magazines, etc that allow people to add and find bibliographic records easily. Microformats, have been also called as \"lower-case Semantic Web\" but they are a very important inflection point within the Semantic Web. Standards like GRRDL, a recent W3C Recommendation, demonstrate that mechanisms from Gleaning Resource Descriptions from Dialects of Languages, are needed to extract Semantic Web Information from X/HTML microformats . In a post on his blog, Stu Weibel wrote: The flexibility that microformats afford is an essential feature of the hyper-innovation that characterizes Web 2.0, but he wondered if Dublin Core fits in the microformats' philosophy. In this report we answer \"YES\": Dublin Core fits perfectly in the microformats' philosophy, just as it does in the context of the \"classic\" Semantic Web. Adopting microformats as a new way to express semantic information with DC allows us to expand the use of DC to new domains that, otherwise, would not use it. In addition, the nature of DC as a general purpose metadata model implicitly suggests its use in microformats for describing resources, especially the bibliographic types of resources previously mentioned. Microformats avoid the problems of updating and synchronizing the information in many sources or formats . But microformats especially are intended to allow people to participate in and take advantage of the Semantic Web in the specific situations already mentioned. The DCMF project intends to combine the simplicity and flexibility of Dublin Core with the possibilities that microformats offer. DCMF is an attempt to make semantic information easy and practical. Furthermore, the ease of parsing web documents with microformats lets us use this semantic information for Web services useful to people. Future work on DC microformats will be the evolution and improvement of those tools described here , and the development of Web services for querying the information within DC microformats. Even though bibliographic exchange has been a reality for decades, exchange of authority information and links between records are still not widely implemented. The standard way of making bibliographic data available is still through search-retrieve protocols such as SRU/W 32 or Z39.50 33 . Though this makes single bibliographic records retrievable, it does not provide a way to directly address them and reveals little or nothing about links between records. In contrast the Semantic Web is by definition built upon linking of information. The promise of the Semantic Web and Linked Data is that it could make data connected, simply by making it available. This, it seems, could be the perfect way for libraries to expose all of their data. A goal when creating the new version of the LIBRIS web interface 34 was to make the information presented to a normal user transparently available to machines/web robots as well. It was also obvious that information not intrinsic to the record itself, such as user annotations and connections to other records could be made available this way. Also, thirty years of continually changing cataloguing rules and practices have left some data in an inconsistent state. Our hope is that the result of the work described will help us work with data in a new and better way. The Swedish Union Catalogue comprises about 175 libraries using a single Integrated Library System for cataloguing. MARC21 is used for bibliographic, holdings and authority records. It contains about six million bibliographic records. A number of components were developed to make the ILS \"talk RDF\". We created an RDF server wrapper to make the ILS accessible through HTTP and able to deliver RDF describing bibliographic and authority resources upon request, as well as RDF describing the links between them. Persistent URIs were created by using each record's unique number, these URIs can be dereferenced and will deliver the RDF when queried properly through HTTP content negotiation. 32 Search/Retrieval via URL -http://www.loc.gov/standards/sru/ 33 Z39.50 -http://www.loc.gov/z3950/agency/ 34 LIBRIS -http://libris.kb.se/ This data could then be loaded into a triple store to enable searching using SPARQL . In this section we will outline the individual components of the implementation. A schematic is provided in FIG. 1 . The first step was to create a wrapper around the ILS that could deliver the records in RDF rather than the binary format normally used for bibliographic records . The wrapper talks to the ILS using SQL and delivers records given its unique number. It then converts the ISO2709 record into an XML representation of MARC21. In the final step a transformation is applied to the XML using XSLT . Since each output format is implemented in a single XSLT-file, adding a new format or making changes to an existing one is trivial. Links and access are crucial underpinnings of both the semantic and \"normal\" web. For a resource to be linkable it needs a URI, for it to be accessible, that URI should be a HTTP one. Following the four rules of Linked Data , a persistent, dereferenceable URI is created for each record. For bibliographic records: http://libris.kb.se/resource/bib/<number>, and for authority records: http://libris.kb.se/resource/auth/<number>. Using HTTP content negotiation, the correct format can be delivered depending on the clients capabilities. This method uses the HTTP Accept header to tell the server what media types the client can handle and prefers. For example, the accept header text/html tells the server to deliver an HTML page suitable for a human user. An accept header containing, for example, text/rdf+n3 or application/rdf+xml tells the server that the client is able to handle RDF. The server can either deliver the data in RDF directly or send an HTTP 302 or 303 response indicating that the information can be found at a different URL . See Appendix A for an example of content negotiation. We were interested in using SPARQL as a tool to both query and analyze data. Some queries that can be hard, or impossible, to formulate using SQL or a full text search language are easily formed using SPARQL. For example, the following query: \"show me all subjects of records that belongs to the same work as the record with identifier XYZ\". A query like this can be very useful for someone wanting to \"auto complete\" missing subject entries on records belonging to the same work. We used the Jena Semantic Web Framework 35 to create a triple store to hold the data. This gave us, with a minimum of work, the possibility to query data using SPARQL. A SPARQL endpoint conforming to the SPARQL Protocol for RDF was implemented to allow queries over HTTP. There are a number of types of resources that needs to be described or made available to reflect the current state of a library catalogue, e.g books, authors, subjects , organizations, links between them, etc. To make the library catalogue available to systems outside the library community, the resources should be described using common vocabularies. We used Dublin Core for bibliographic data, FOAF 36 for persons and organizations, and SKOS 37 for controlled vocabularies. These are all widely used and understood standards. An example graph is displayed in FIG. 2 . See Appendix A for example records. It is important to point out that it is possible to deliver multiple formats in parallel, so catering to the world outside the library community does not exclude systems aware of library standards. As described in 3.1 RDF Server Wrapper adding support for Bibliontology, MODS, MarcOnt or any other standard is easy, it is, however, not the subject of this paper. The Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records has been around for a decade, much has been written about it, though actual implementations are few. One hurdle to overcome is the shifting quality of the records due to continually changing practices. However, the idea of grouping or linking records being part of the same work is an appealing and technically viable one. Every record in the LIBRIS database gets assigned one or more FRBR-keys, these keys are the normalized concatenations of an author and the original title. The process is repeated for each author and title. For example, the book \"The Difference Engine\" by William Gibson and Bruce Sterling has two keys: \"GIBSON WILLIAM 1948 THE DIFFERENCE ENGINE\", and \"STERLING BRUCE 1954 THE DIFFERENCE ENGINE\". Links are then created between records with the same key. This is similar to the approach of Styles et al. where the MD5 checksum of the name of the author and the title of the work are used as an identifier. However, an important distinction compared to Styles et al. is that these keys are transient; they are never used as identifiers, only to create the links between records of the same work. This way, when an author dies, changes his/her name, etc. the links remain the same even though the keys change. There is therefore no need to keep track of changes since no identifier has been published. Another advantage is that works with more than one author is handled automatically, as well as records containing more than one work. The LIBRIS database also contains actual work records in the form of name+title authority records. These are linked to their respective bibliographic records. The sheer amount of bibliographic records prohibits manual creation of these for the whole database, nevertheless these links are included in the RDF. Linking to external resources gives the client a way of finding more information about a given resource. As a proof-of-concept the LIBRIS database contains a handful of links from authority records to DBpedia and Wikipedia. See Appendix A for an example. We have also experimented with user annotation using the annotea ontology. Since the URIs used to identify records/resources are available outside the ILS, attaching data, such as user reviews, to them is easy and non-intrusive. Although there are a number of ontologies available to describe bibliographic data, the data contained in library systems are not generally available. The access mechanisms described in Linked Data need to be implemented for libraries to truly be \"part of the semantic web\". SPARQL shows real promise when it comes to mining the bibliographic data for information due to it's linked nature. Planned next steps include using SPARQL for automatic creation of work records, implementing a richer description of bibliographic and authority records and loading more external data into the triple store. We are closely following the work of the DCMI/RDA Task Group 38 . We are currently exploring the possibility of making parts of this work available as Open Source. More information will be available at http://libris.kb.se/semweb. Metadata Scheme Design, Application, and Use The Dryad repository 39 is a partnership between the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center 40 and the School of Information and Library Science, Metadata Research Center 41 at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The repository hosts data supporting published research in the field of evolutionary biology. Dryad is currently working collaboratively with ten leading journals that publish evolutionary biology research, including Evolution, The American Naturalist, and Ecology. These journals have agreed to integrate their submission systems with Dryad in the near future, eventually creating a seamless publication process from author to journal to Dryad data deposition. Two goals informing Dryad's current metadata activities include: 1. Dryad's need to be interoperable with other data repositories used by evolutionary biologists; and 2. Dryad's need for a sustainable information infrastructure. The first goal has inspired our development of the Dryad application profile, version 1.0; and the second goal has led to Dryad's adoption of DSpace software and technology. Current metadata activities for the Dryad development team include revising the project's application profile so that it is compliant with the Singapore Framework. The Singapore Framework is a model that was released at the 2007 Dublin Core conference approximately a year after our team created the DRIADE application profile, version 1.0 . Ongoing Dryad metadata work also includes evaluating the effectiveness of our revised application profile and integrating it into a DSpace environment. This report reviews these two metadata focused activities, and highlights recent accomplishments and challenges. Dryad's metadata application profile, ver.1.0, has two modules; one module describes data objects, and the other module describes the associating publication. We developed the application profile to support basic resource and data discovery, with the goal of being interoperable with other data repositories used by evolutionary biologists. The application profile is designed to automatically capture as much metadata as possible during publication and data deposition processing. The application profile incorporates elements from the following established metadata schemes: Dublin Core, Darwin Core, Data Documentation Initiative , Ecological Metadata Language , and PREservation Metadata Implementation Strategies . The Dryad application profile, ver. 1.0, supports Dryad's phase one functionalities that were established in a stakeholders' workshop in December 2006 42 . These functionalities include the capturing, basic preservation, and simple retrieval of datasets and metadata for associated publications. In the future, metadata elements from other metadata schemes will be needed for projected features. Dryad's phased development and corresponding functionalities are summarized in Table 1 . DSpace is a software package for digital repository systems 43 . DSpace provides basic services to deposit, store, search, and retrieve digital content, but it was designed for a particular use case , and significant modifications will be required to make DSpace suit the needs of Dryad users. Although the DSpace infrastructure has been adopted by many repositories, research on the integration of application profiles, especially those complying with the Singapore Framework, is still limited. Implementing the first iteration of the Dryad application profile in DSpace is allowing us to test the application profile, as well as evaluate the long-term applicability of DSpace for Dryad's needs. DSpace was chosen due to its adaptability and support of Dublin Core metadata, as well as the DSpace community's support for enhancing metadata functionality, as evidenced by developments such as the SKOS module. Although most DSpace functionality revolves around qualified Dublin Core metadata, the software collects additional metadata that can be used to fill in details of the application profile, including qualifiers associated with elements drawn from other metadata schemes. Metadata fields not native to DSpace are configured as custom fields, which can be stored, searched, and displayed in the same manner as the native fields. A major advantage of DSpace is its system for managing user accounts, which can be adapted for the eventual Dryad functionality of allowing end-users to submit content and create basic metadata. However, the default workflow for submitting content and generating metadata in DSpace is entirely too long and awkward for end-users, and is further complicated by the needs of the Dryad metadata model. A more configurable submission system is included in the recently released DSpace 1.5, but significant work will still be required to allow users to submit content without difficulty. One drawback of the DSpace model is that metadata with hierarchical information are not supported by the core repository. Hierarchical information, which is necessary for tracking data such as contact information for multiple authors of a publication, must be stored in an extra file attached to the object, and modifications must be made to the default DSpace functionality if any of this information is to be used beyond simple display. Another difficulty of using DSpace is the lack of a configurable access control system, a critical feature for Dryad. One requirement of Dryad is to collect and store publications to facilitate automatic metadata generation, while simultaneously shielding these publications from end-users. Some of the content stored in Dryad will need to be placed under embargo. While others have implemented these features in DSpace, the core distribution does not include them. Modifications to the core DSpace code must be kept to a minimum if we are to take advantage of future upgrades. Therefore, it will be challenging to optimize Dryad for users and metadata creators while minimizing deviation from the core DSpace platform. The Singapore Framework provides a model for the structure of Dublin Core application profiles . Conformance with the Singapore Framework includes the benefits of consistency, long-term quality control, and interoperability with other metadata structures. A significant effort over the last few months has been to bring the Dryad application profile, ver. 1, which is based largely on Dublin Core, in line with the Singapore Framework. Reasons for this step include the benefits noted by Nilsson, et al. , as well as, our goal to comply and interoperate with Semantic Web standards. All five Singapore Framework components have been examined for the Dryad metadata schema adaptation . The five components include the following: 1. Functional requirements; 2. Domain model; 3. Description Set Profile; 4. Usage guidelines; and 5. Encoding syntax guidelines. With the exception of the optional encoding syntax guidelines, the other four components have been deemed appropriate for the Dryad's application profile revision. The Scholarly Works Application Profile 44 is a key example of an application profile in conformance with the Singapore Framework, and provides a model for the Dryad description. The results of the initial restructuring can be found online as part of the repository project wiki. Addressing the Singapore Framework's first mandatory component, Dryad's functional requirements are based on project system requirement specifications. Using the SWAP example as a model, the Dryad's functional requirements address scope, stakeholders and designated community, requirements gathering, and functional requirements. Dryad's functional requirements include supporting the following operations: 1. resource discovery and use; 2. data interoperability; 3. computer-aided metadata generation and augmentation; 4. linking publications and underlying datasets; 5. data and metadata quality control; and 6. Data security. The designated community for the Dryad application profile includes researchers in the field of evolutionary biology who are generating data and reusing data for their own projects and scientists searching for datasets that are applicable to their own research. Stakeholders are evolutionary biologists, journal publishers in the field of evolutionary biology, professional societies in evolutionary biology, and NESCent. The methodology employed to gather system requirements involved assessing the needs and goals of individuals and groups identified as stakeholders and community members through a workshop held in December 2006 at NESCent in Durham, North Carolina, and more recently an ongoing use case study. Full details about the application profile functional requirements have been added to the Dryad project wiki46.The second mandatory component of the Singapore Framework is the domain model. Unlike the SWAP example, the Dryad application profile is \"data-centric\" rather than document-or publication-centric. Dryad's application profile, ver. 1.0, accommodates a single publication or article with published data from one or more datasets. This relationship is represented in Figure 2 . The third mandatory component, the Description Set Profile is proving to be the most challenging aspect of the application profile revision process. As previously mentioned, the Dryad application profile is based largely on Dublin Core, but also incorporates elements from domain-specific namespaces such as PRISM, DDI, EML, and DarwinCore. None of the namespaces, except Dublin Core, are currently represented in RDF and cannot be included in the DSP. The Dryad development team has been discussing whether or not to declare unique elements for Dryad use in order to complete the Description Set Profile. Despite this challenge, the first draft of the Dryad DSP, which only includes Dublin Core elements, is available for viewing 47 . The fourth component, which is optional, is the usage guidelines, which have been collaboratively developed by Dryad team members and also appear online. The Dryad usage guidelines provide descriptions of each element and details regarding use 48 . Additionally, the guidelines also elaborate upon the constraints defined by the DSP. The application profile revisions undertaken to comply with the Singapore Framework has strengthened the overall metadata architecture of the Dryad repository. It has also helped the project team identify key challenges, such as limitations in the current state of citation metadata, and the project's need to encode rights metadata. Furthermore, it has aided the Dryad development team in identifying metadata issues, and clarifying those issues that require administrative or policy decision, prior to determining the appropriate metadata element or value. The most pressing issue facing the Dryad team is to determine how or if elements from non-Dublin Core namespaces should be included in the Dryad DSP and how the elements will be represented during DSpace implementation. The inclination is to use what has already been determined by a community to be useful, and furthermore to take advantage of the work and documentation already available from other initiatives; however, the issues with interoperability remain unavoidable at this time. Therefore, the Dryad team may choose to declare unique elements for the repository project. The benefits of moving forward in line with the Singapore Framework are critical to the longterm success of Dryad and its ability to take advantage of metadata to improve system performance. The ongoing revision of the Dryad application profile, ver. 1, will result in the release and publication of the Dryad application profile, ver. 2.0. As part of our application profile development work, we are also taking into account selected functionalities of Dryad's phase two . Additional ongoing activities include revising Dryad's interface for entering metadata and streamlining the metadata creation and submission process to support authordepositors. As Dryad evolves, we are anticipating that the recent release of DSpace 1.5 will impact the amount of work the project is able to complete with respect to specific metadata goals and other desired functionalities. In conclusion, Dryad's metadata structure is evolving, and will be revised over time, taking into consideration Semantic Web standards and innovations that support the overall goals of Dryad. Effective metadata standards are required to efficiently handle the large amounts of data collected in imaging and scholarly studies of the earliest known copy of Archimedes' work. The Dublin Core Metadata Element Set is being utilized to provide key identification information, with additional metadata extensions to ensure the imaging and scholarly information can be readily integrated in a Web 2.0 environment. Applying the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative Metadata Element Set and additional elements from the DCTerms namespace to a variety of images containing different texts in a rapidly changing technology environment has posed a unique set of challenges. These challenges include linking together and integrating data from different sources and formats: Digital images from advanced cameras in numerous spectral bands, and digitally encoded texts in varied fonts from a team of scholars. With increased focus on data management and explosive growth in data with advanced imaging techniques, the application of the DCMI Metadata Element Set provides a robust data set that will meet worldwide metadata standards. The Archimedes Palimpsest Program is a 10-year effort to produce digital images of Archimedes' text as originally written on parchment in the latter half of the tenth century. In the early thirteenth century, this text was scraped off and overwritten, or \"palimpsested,\" to create a prayer book. A team of scientists and scholars has been digitally imaging and studying the 174 parchment leaves that currently make up the Archimedes Palimpsest. Since the 2006 Dublin Core Conference the program has developed new imaging techniques that have yielded over two terabytes of data. This includes images of the only copies of Archimedes treatises The Method and Stomachion; the only copy in Greek of On Floating Bodies; and copies of the Equilibrium of Planes, Spiral Lines, The Measurement of the Circle, and Sphere and Cylinder. Imaging has also revealed ten leaves of text by the fourth century B.C. Greek orator Hyperides; six leaves of commentaries on Aristotle; four liturgical leaves; and twelve leaves from two unidentified books. At the time of the 2006 Dublin Core Conference, the imaging team had imaged the entire palimpsest with three spectral bands of light, yielding three images for each leaf and processed \"pseudocolor\" images in what was then considered to be a large data set of about 240 Gigabytes of data. Since the 2006 conference, the imaging team developed new imaging techniques to yield more information with more advanced cameras and lighting in 12 spectral bands. These yielded 16 images of each leaf and more refined processed images with a total of about 2,400 GB of data. Managing all this data required careful metadata logging and data management based on the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set. The Archimedes Palimpsest team also created images of key leaves at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory using X-ray fluorescence. This required an extensive range of metadata extensions to capture the broad range of metadata on energy levels and system parameters. They also imaged original prints of photographs of the Archimedes Palimpsest taken almost 100 years earlier at the direction of John Ludwig Heiberg in Constantinople, and photographs of one leaf taken in Chicago in the 1930's. These images of the photographs offered standardized images of text that has since been lost, and one leaf that has been lost in its entirety. With 6,797 digital images and 130 pages of transcriptions of the Archimedes Palimpsest, metadata has proved to be essential for 1) accessing images and integrating spectral bands for digital processing and enhancement, 2) managing transcriptions from those images for study by scholars around the world, and 3) linking and integrating the images and the transcriptions. This work required extensive identification metadata to ensure the data was manageable, as well as spatial metadata to line up and register the various images. The Dublin Core Metadata Element Set offers the key identification elements required for image storage, management and retrieval, with additional spatial and spectral information added as extensions. The \"Identification,\" \"Data Type\" and \"Data Content\" metadata elements incorporate the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set. The \"Spatial Data Reference\" and \"Imaging and Spectral Data Reference\" elements are extensions to the DCMI Standards, using metadata elements detailed in the Federal Geographic Data Committee Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata. The standard is hosted on the www.archimedespalimpsest.org website. In keeping with the project goals of long term data and metadata accessibilty, the program follows the DCMI's principble of simplicity. We have created records that are machine-readable with very little effort and easily intelligible by a human reader. Each image metadata record is a series of simple name-value pairs, employing Dublin Core and project-specific metadata elements . Since the 2006 Dublin Core Conference, individuals with standards experience in OCLC and other organizations have provided input on the best application of the Dublin Core Standard to the Archimedes Palimpsest Metadata Standard. A range of organizations have also provided guidance on the use of standards for archival purposes, including guidance for the best use of standards in the digital data set to ensure users years hence will have access to the actual versions of the standards used in creating the data set. Input from the Library of Congress, the British Library, NASA and Google proved fruitful in defining the application of standards not only to the Web 2.0 environment, but the range of possible digital environments possible in decades to come. Scholars have been transcribing the Greek text since the initial digital imaging, revealing new information about the origins of mathematical theories and science. The integration of these scholarly transcriptions in digital form with the digital images has taken on greater impetus since the 2006 Dublin Core Conference, with the digital tagging and encoding of text in various forms and formats, including handwritten, MSWord Symbol font, and various other custom fonts. A team of scholars and students is encoding the transcribed text into XML tagged Unicode following the Text Encoding Initiative standards . <seg TEIform=\"seg\" n=\"17v1\" part=\"N\" type=\"folio\"> <seg TEIform=\"seg\" n=\"1\" part=\"N\" type=\"line\"> <supplied TEIform=\"supplied\" reason=\"lost\"> <expan TEIform=\"expan\">ὅτι</expan> τὸ ΦΑ</supplied> μέγε<supplied TEIform=\"supplied\" reason=\"lost\">θος</supplied> τῶι βάρει πρὸς </seg> <seg TEIform=\"seg\" n=\"2\" part=\"N\" type=\"line\"> <supplied TEIform=\"supplied\" reason=\"lost\">τὸ ὑγρ</supplied>ὸν τὸ ἰσόογκον τοῦτον ἔχει</seg> <seg TEIform=\"seg\" n=\"3\" part=\"N\" type=\"line\">τὸν λόγον, ὃν τὸ Α <expan TEIform=\"expan\">πρὸς</expan> τὸ Φ<unclear TEIform=\"unclear\" >Α</unclear>.</seg> </seg> Header information is provided for each folio in the encoded text, with cross-walked Dublin Core Identification and Data Content metadata elements mapped to the TEI format . These encoded texts are then hosted with the images, with the Dublin Core elements providing a common structure for image and transcription metadata. The images and transcriptions are linked through metadata in the Archimedes Palimpsest Data Product, enabling common searches, access and study. The standard use of the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set across the products of the image scientists and scholars enables linkage between these two disparate data sets for further study . Integrating metadata of various types tailored to meet a range of users' needs has proven critical to making integrated data available across domains and disciplines amidst ever changing technologies. Building on the Archimedes Palimpsest application, the DCMI Standards are being used to integrate hyperspectral imaging of the Waldseemuller 1507 Map at the Library of Congress. The DCMI Standards serve as the basis for information discovery in the Web 2.0 environment, and hopefully for decades to come in future formats and technologies. This information will advance the study of the original manuscript by individuals around the world with ubiquitous access via the Internet. It has long been recognized that contextual metadata is important for facilitating access to documents in archival collections . More recently, digital collections have come to be understood as information seeking contexts through \"unitary\" 49 and \"analytic\" 50 descriptive approaches . Cultural heritage institutions have purposefully conceptualized and developed their digital collections in many ways, as \"displays\", \"tours\", \"tools\", \"lessons\", and to provide a record of cultural events . However, in a large digital federation or aggregation, the purpose of the original, deliberately built collections becomes difficult to discern. Collectionlevel metadata has the potential to provide important information about features of a parent collection and why it might be of value to users. But the qualitative aspects of collections are difficult to describe in a systematic way, as they may embody a good deal of intellectual intent and tend to be highly complex and mutable. This paper reports on the current phase of the Digital Collections and Content project that is investigating how to represent collection context for scholarly use of large-scale, heterogeneous digital aggregations. The DCC provides integrated access to over 200 digital 49 Defined as: \"consists only of information about the collection as a whole.", "meta": {"ref_id": "Greenbergetal."}}
{"text": "67 See for example . The authors, after evaluating different APIs for distributed KOS access, criticize the fact that most APIs mimic the data structure of the KOS too closely and don't support advanced operations like \"chunking\", i.e., the retrieval of a defined set of concepts with one request to the server. Steering clear of the intricate philosophical problem if a group of things constitutes an information resource while the things alone do not, the cited sources all suggest that concepts of a KOS should be treated as abstract objects . To represent that fact, the {resource} segment has been introduced into the URI to distinguish between the abstract DDC concept and a description of that concept. While http://dewey.info/class/338.4 indentifies the concept, http://dewey.info/ class/338.4/about identifies the information resource describing this concept. Since this last URI is designed to be representation-agnostic and provides links to more specific resources, it is in fact the generic representation of this resource. The benefit of pointing the agent to a generic information resource before negotiating the contents of the representation is mainly semantic. By using this technique it is made clear that all descriptions of the identified resource are variants of the same representation and roughly convey the same information. The relationship of each of those resources to the generic resource is such that they specify one or more dimensions of its genericity. For example, in our context http://dewey.info/class/338.4/about exemplifies an identifier for a generic resource, being about an abstract concept. The relationship between the URI and the representation of the resource it identifies may change over time, with respect to language and format requested. The use of the same URI will still be valid, however, because these new resources are considered more specific versions of the generic resource, and their respective relationships would be given as RDF statements about the dimension they specify. On the other hand, the resource that http://dewey.info/class/338.4/2008/04/03/about identifies or retrieves is only time-invariant but language-and format-generic, whereas for http:// dewey.info/class/338.4/2008/04/03/about.en.skos it is completely fixed. It should also be noted in this context that removing the language from the concept URI implies that a specific language version of a DDC concept can never be addressed as an abstract concept, but only as an information resource describing the abstract concept. The concept of generic resources is especially important for designating a canonical URI for a given set of resources/representations. The findings above suggest that a candidate for a canonical URI should identify the most generic in a set of resources that can be grouped together as variants of each other. There are numerous DDC entities that have not been addressed so far and will therefore not be addressable by the URIs shown above. That doesn't mean that they won't be accessible to applications, however. Even if one assumes that these entities might be irrelevant from a service perspective, it would perhaps be useful to achieve higher granularity for users of the full Dewey data file; and in representation formats like SKOS, every reference has to be a URI, anyway. One possibility would therefore be to use opaque URIs in the http://dewey.info/id namespace in parallel, which, for all entities that already have other identifiers, would have to be handled as URI aliases. This set could correspond directly and exhaustively to entities in the Dewey database as represented in MARC Classification and Authorities formats, its entities could be related by OWL and even be used publicly for permalinks. Another solution: the proposed scheme might be extended by adding fragment identifiers, enabling access to specific pieces of information beyond the level of the suggested URIs, for example, http://dewey.info/class/1--012/e22/about#caption to just indentify the caption \"Classification\" of that class, but these specific entities might be misleading if applied across different data formats , e.g., MARC Classification vs. SKOS. Another potential drawback is that fragment identifiers are stripped from the URI by the user agent, so a service endpoint will never see them. The usefulness of \"shortcuts\" has to be addressed in general as well. Every time a \"default\" is introduced, the expressiveness of the scheme is impoverished by de facto defining URI aliases for some resources. If http://dewey.info/concept/338.4 defaults today to the same representation that is retrieved by http://dewey.info/ concept/338.4/2008/04/04/about.en.html, the possibility is lost to use the original URI as a canonical identifier for the 338.4 concept independently of time, language, or format. Yet such an identifier is a powerful tool that could retrieve all information about translations, former versions of this concept etc. as OWL or RDF expressions, making it possible for an agent to just work from this resource for any given concept. A better general way of indicating shortcuts would be to interpret an unspecified {aspect} segment as trigger for defaulting behavior, for example: only http://dewey.info/338.4 would be defined as an alias of the fixed resource shown above, but not http://dewey.info/concept/338.4. The European Union has 23 official languages; many more regional and minority languages are spoken in the 27 member states. A 2006 European Commission/Eurobarometer study revealed that \"56% of EU citizens are able to hold a conversation in a language other than their mother tongue\", \"28% state that they master two languages along with their native language\", and \"approximately 1 in 10 respondents has sufficient skills to have a conversation in three languages\". In this linguistically diverse and multilingual environment in the EU, there is a tremendous need to provide cross-language access to information . However, European libraries not only do not share a language, they also have no common subject heading system, classification system, authority files, or bibliographic format. Thus, cross-language access to information in library collections is a complex and difficult problem involving not only natural language analysis and translation, but also the mapping of library subject headings, classifications, and bibliographic formats, presenting problems of both syntactic and semantic interoperability. The CACAO Project , begun in December 2007, is a 24-month targeted project supported by the eContentplus Programme of the European Commission. It is a consortium of nine partners: Cité des sciences et de l'industrie and Xerox Research Centre Europe from France; the Free University of Bozen-Bolzano, CELI, and Gonetwork from Italy; Kórnik Library from Poland; the National Széchényi Library and the Hungarian Academy of Sciences from Hungary; and Goettingen State and University Library of Germany. The libraries in the CACAO consortium use a total of at least six different subject heading systems and five different classification systems . Three of the libraries are multilingual libraries. CACAO will modify and extend work that has already been implemented at the Library of the Free University of Bozen-Bolzano, a multilingual library having major collections in Italian, German, and English, each with its own subject heading system, as described by Bernardi et al. . This report reviews two of the important metadata-related challenges that CACAO faces involving the specification of the language of the metadata fields, \"false friends\" and term ambiguity, and discusses our solutions. We begin with a short description of the CACAO architecture. Figure 1 -Architecture Overview , pg. 4) The CACAO architecture in Figure 1 is designed to support the following vision. A user should be able to enter a monolingual query, say cat in English, and retrieve highly relevant records not just in English, but also in any supported language in the database, including records containing, for example, the German word for cat, Katze, French chat, Hungarian macska, Italian gatto, or Polish kot. As a least-common-denominator solution, CACAO will harvest metadata through library OAI-PMH interfaces, minimally in Dublin Core; MARC 21 may also be accepted if available. The CACAO Corpus Analysis Subsystem performs a variety of analyses on the metadata off-line, the results of which are stored locally and used in support of online Query Processing. When the user enters a query, the Query Processing Subsystem, with the assistance of third-party Web Services providing linguistic analyses, translations, etc., translates and expands the query and matches it against the results of the Corpus Analysis Subsystem. Of course, resources such as lexica, multilingual dictionaries, and thesauri and other controlled vocabularies are accessed by the subsystems. We will use a simple example to illustrate some metadata-related problems that arise and some of the possible solutions that we are investigating; these are issues that are challenges not just for CACAO, but also for the library community. Suppose a user enters the query stove, wanting to retrieve records containing the English word stove or the German translation Herd. USER QUERY: stove The procedure might seem to be very simple: the Query Processing Subsystem looks up English stove in the English-German dictionary, retrieves the German translation Herd, and builds a Boolean search query containing those two expressions: QUERY: stove or Herd However, this simple query also retrieves false hits containing the English word herd: FALSE HIT: <dc:title>Animal status monitoring and herd management</dc:title> CORRECT: <dc:title>Herd und Ofen im Mittelalter</dc:title> CORRECT: <dc:title>The Stove-Top Cook Book</dc:title> English herd and German Herd are \"false friends\", i.e., words in different languages that look similar but that have different meanings. False friends are fairly common, for example English gift-German Gift , English pain-French pain , and English cane-Italian cane . Knowing or being able to determine the language of the terms in a given metadata field increases precision when dealing with false friends. The language would optimally be provided in the metadata itself, as we might find in a German-language catalog which owns the Englishlanguage book The Stove-Top Cook Book to which German-and English-language subject headings are assigned: <dc:title xml:lang=\"en\">The Stove-Top Cook Book</dc:title> <dc:subject xml:lang=\"de\">Herd</dc:subject> <dc:subject xml:lang=\"en\">Stove</dc:subject> In the case of a subject term, information about the source of the term in the <dc:subject> field could provide enough information to be able to deduce the language. In this case, we could deduce the language with a fairly high degree of certainty from the fact that the SWD is a German-language subject heading system: <dc:subject xsi:type=\"cacao:SWD\">Herd</dc:subject> This information about the language of the content of the field will be used by CACAO in presenting the ranked results list. Since the German term Herd appears in German-language fields in this record: <dc:title xml:lang=\"de\">Herd und Ofen im Mittelalter</dc:title> <dc:subject xsi:type=\"cacao:SWD\">Herd</dc:subject> it would be ranked higher than a record in which the false friend of the German translation of the original search term appears in an English-language field. Alternatively, such a record could be excluded entirely from the results list. <dc:title xml:lang=\"en\">Animal status monitoring and herd management</dc:title> 3.3. Solution 3: Association to a Class However, metadata are not always enriched with language or authority attributes as they are in this ideal catalog. CACAO's technical partners are developing a solution for this scenario, the association of terms to a fairly broad class in a library classification system such as the Dewey Decimal Classification . In our example, the off-line Corpus Analysis Subsystem must have been able to determine that materials about stoves are commonly classed in, e.g., DDC 640 , and it has stored this association: stove:DDC 640. One option would be to organize the results list according to class. For instance, records containing the terms stove or Herd with a <dc:subject xsi:type=\"dcterms:DDC\"> element having the DDC value provided by the Corpus Analysis Subsystem, 640: <dc:title>Herd und Ofen im Mittelalter</dc:title> <dc:subject xsi:type=\"dcterms:DDC\">640</dc:subject> would be presented in a group which would be ranked higher than groups of records containing one of those terms with some other DDC value for the <dc:subject> element, including records containing the false friend. <dc:title>Animal status monitoring and herd management</dc:title> <dc:subject xsi:type=\"dcterms:DDC\">630</dc:subject> The association to a class technique is used in information retrieval and in CACAO for an even more common problem: term ambiguity. The English word pipe, for instance, is ambiguous, meaning either \"a long tube\", German Rohr, or \"a device for smoking\", German Pfeife. For purposes of exposition, assume that on entering pipe as a search query, the user is asked which meaning is intended and that the user selects the meaning \"a long tube\". Using the association to a class technique, the Corpus Analysis Subsystem has determined that relevant materials are often classed in DDC 690 . Again, one option would be to organize the results list according to class, similar to the stove/Herd example. Records containing the terms pipe or Rohr and including a <dc:subject xsi:type=\"dcterms:DDC\"> element having the DDC value provided by the Corpus Analysis Subsystem, 690: <dc:title>Plumbers and pipe fitters library</dc:title> <dc:subject xsi:type=\"dcterms:DDC\">690</dc:subject> would be presented in a group which would be ranked higher than groups of records containing one of those terms with some other value for the <dc:subject> element, including records containing the term pipe in its unintended meaning: <dc:title>The pleasures of pipe smoking</dc:title> <dc:subject xsi:type=\"dcterms:DDC\">390</dc:subject> Association to a class can also be used to disambiguate an ambiguous target term. For instance, the English search term dog translated into Italian is cane. However, Italian cane has two senses, \"dog\" and \"cock of a weapon\", which would be disambiguated in the same way. Records containing the terms dog or cane and including a <dc:subject xsi:type=\"dcterms:DDC\"> element having the DDC value 630 would be presented in a group which would be ranked higher than groups of records containing one of those terms with some other value for the <dc:subject> element, including records containing the term cane in its unintended meaning. We have argued that the specification of the language of the metadata field, in addition to that of the document itself, is very important so that metadata can be fully exploited for crosslanguage purposes or in multilingual settings. If the metadata do not come with or cannot be enriched with the languages of the fields, then CACAO must rely on the association to a class technique, which will be needed in any case. Association to a class was originally designed for and will be used as a solution to the term ambiguity problem; it is similar to synsets used in WordNet and EuroWordNet, which CACAO may also use. The solution involving association to a class may also work as association to a subject heading, although that would require further preparation and testing. It is important to note that in the association to a class technique, the CACAO Corpus Analysis Subsystem must be able to associate a term such as English stove to some class and then the system must be able to match potential hits containing a term such as Herd against that same class. In other words, either the systems must contain the same classification system or their classification or subject headings systems must be mappable to the same system. Thus, CACAO's experience with cross-language access so far strongly supports Koch, Neuroth, and Day ; NKOS ; Chan and Zeng ; ; and many others in the library community who have discussed the importance of the interoperability of subject vocabularies and of classification systems for information retrieval in cross-domain environments. CACAO will rely on already existing mappings such as those provided by the MACS project , which has worked on mappings for RAMEAU , Library of Congress Subject Headings , and Schlagwortnormdatei . For optimal performance, even if the metadata of a given collection does not contain the specification for the language of the field as outlined in section 3.2, the Corpus Analysis Subsystem must still have access to such enriched metadata in order to avoid the false friends problem in its off-line analyses. For instance, if the Corpus Analysis Subsystem must determine which class German Gift \"poison\" is most commonly associated with, then it should avoid analyzing fields in which the English gift is found. However, we anticipate that the Corpus Analysis Subsystem will have access to a more extensive stored collection of associations between terms and classes than might be available for a given collection. A prototype of the CACAO information retrieval system was entered in the CLEF 2008 campaign, providing an opportunity to tune and evaluate the system on cross-language library metadata. CACAO's attention will soon turn to related issues involving metadata exchange and interoperability and thereby further explore the characteristics of Dublin Core in its crosslanguage duties. The European Library, whose Application Profile is Dublin Core-based, will integrate and evaluate CACAO technologies beginning in late 2008. Furthermore, CACAO libraries will be grouped into a single portal and CACAO will additionally create several thematic portals in order to further develop, demonstrate, and promote CACAO technologies. Other challenges include the complex relationships caused by differences of granularities of two original schemes and their presentation with various levels of SKOS elements; as well as the diverse coordination of entries due to the use of auxiliary tables and pre-coordinated headings derived from combining classes, subdivisions, and thesaurus terms, which do not correspond to existing unique identifiers. The poster reports the progress, shares the sample SKOS entries, and summarizes problems identified during the SKOS encoding process. Although OWL Lite and OWL Full provide richer expressiveness, the cost-benefit issues and the final purposes of encoding CCT raise questions of using such approaches. Simon Spero UNC Chapel Hill, USA ses@unc.edu Keywords: LCSH; Controlled vocabularies; Hierarchical relationships; visualization The Library of Congress Subject Headings has been developed over the course of more than a century, predating the semantic web by some time. Until the 1986, the only concept-toconcept relationship available was an undifferentiated \"See Also\" reference, which was used for both associative and hierarchical connections. In that year, in preparation for the first release of the headings in machine readable MARC Authorities form, an attempt was made to automatically convert these \"See Also\" links into the standardized thesaural relations. Unfortunately, the rule used to determine the type of reference to generate relied on the presence of symmetric links to detect associatively related terms; \"See Also\" references that were only present in one of the related terms were assumed to be hierarchical.

{"text": "This is a count of arcs connecting one element to another. This number is somewhat biased by the number of elements. The \"Average Fan-out factor\" is the average number of elements that can follow another. The value of 7.76 for museum labels means that on average any element can be followed by any 7 different elements. Variability within elements: Dictionary aided classification is usually unavailable in herbaria label data set. In Address problems, the proper name is an open class but the other elements are much more finite. The number of states, cities within a state and roads within a city are finite. In contrast, there are on the order of 1.5 million scientific names. The International Plant Name Index contains many thousands of entries but is far from complete particularly for older names that have been replaced yet appeared on museum labels. There are also variations in spelling because of human error or changes in nomenclatural rules. The list of all Collectors is also exceedingly long and labels do not follow any single authority. The location where a specimen was found is also an open class. It includes descriptions of locations, e.g. \"300 meters NNW of the last rapids on Stanley Falls, Belgium Congo\". The museum domain is much more complex than the address problem as showed above and information extraction accuracy using the previously developed methods are inadequate. In this section we discuss methods we have used to enhance performance by extending the methods used for previous data sets. The goal of the learning phase of machine learning is to use representative examples to develop models that can, when presented with novel input, create proper classification of the input. Our first training data consists 200 digitized OCR records from the Yale Peabody Herbarium with multiple label formats randomly selected from the typed labels which requiring 10,095 element classifications. The HERBIS Learning System is part of the overall HERBIS system. Museums anywhere in the world can create digital images of their specimens on their site. These images can be passed to the Yale Peabody Museum OCR processing unit where the label is detected and converted to a string sequence. This text packet is sent to HLS at UIUC though a web services connection. The text is converted to an XML document with appropriate information labeled and returns them to the end user. Other image handling services such as MorphBank can call the classification programs directly. HLS uses a modified Hidden Markov Model. The HMM algorithm is discussed elsewhere . The HMM induces a probability distribution on sequences of symbols. The HMM model is an order-preserving algorithm. There are three canonical problems associated with HMM could be solved by different algorithms. One of them is useful in information extraction context. Given the output sequence , find the most likely sequence of hidden states that could have generated a given output sequence. In other words, given the word sequence , find the most likely sequences of element ,sp,sa). This problem is solved by the Viterbi algorithm. A Naïve Bayes model is a probability model based on conditional probabilities. The NB model makes predictions based on the probability distribution of features from the training set. The NB algorithm uses the distribution information to calculate the probabilities that a new instance belonging to the classes. The example would then be classified to the highest probability class. For computational efficiency NB assumes that each feature is conditionally independent of every other feature . This \"independent\" assumption greatly simplifies the model but the assumption is far from accurate in many cases. However, the overall classifier works surprisingly well in practice . The NB calculations are imbedded in part of the HMM algorithm. In order to show the HMM performance comparing to others, we also implemented a nonordered algorithm NB as the baseline and then present of series of extension to HMM below. The following example used the training data that was enhanced by including both the original OCR errors in the training set plus examples where the OCR errors were hand corrected. The difference from this correction is small so we only present the difference between HMM and NB on 41 elements that occur more than 20 times in the training set . There is a set of elements in our dataset which we call \"field element identifiers\" . Some elements of some data labels are preceded by a string to identify the information that follows. For example, the term \"Legit\" in the string \"Legit A. H. Curtiss\" or \"No.\" in \"No. 503\" in Figure 1 . In the museum label training data and machine learning output, we mark these with a terminal \"L\", e.g. COL, LOL , HBL . Those label elements usually indicate that there is respectively a CO, LC, HB element following it, except in cases of missing data and alignment errors. Rather than training the HMM algorithm to extract the Darwin Core elements and treat these other elements as NS, we train the algorithms to recognize the field element identifiers as well. Our result shows that those label elements improve the ML overall 4%. Figure 3 presents the detailed performance differences between with label encoding in the schema and without those field element identifiers. It is very difficult to improve the performance the ML without large numbers of training examples . Unfortunately, it is very expensive to get botanists to create these examples because creating the training examples from the raw OCR output is very time consuming. The analysis above indicated that the performance difference between the USPS address and HERBIS collection are mainly attributable to the relative homogeneity in the format of the USPS addresses. There may be thousands of different formats of labels that have evolved over the last couple hundred years and now reside in museum collections. However, each collector has their own preferred format of label. This means that a particular museum will tend to have a relatively finite number of collectors supplying the museum at any one time and therefore will have a finite number of label formats represented in the collection. Further, if many museums are digitizing labels, then eventually, there will be corrected sets of labels for many collectors. It may be possible to develop multiple training modules each of which specializes in a particular collector and therefore label format. This observation leads to the hypotheses that the specialist model will perform better for records by the same author than for a generalized model trained on a random data collection and That fewer training examples will be required to reach a given level of performance using all labels from the same collector than would be required for a mixed collection of collectors. These hypotheses are supported in the results of the experiment below. HLS includes the following Specialist Bootstrapping Architecture . Rather than following the standard machine learning model of creating training data >> generate model >> deploy model, we design a model where multiple museums could use available models to classify their data but as part of their workflow when they correct the machine learning data to put into their own database those examples are added to a new training pool. This pool can be subdivided into sub-collections to construct new specialist models . When the end-user sends a museum image to the server, the server would perform OCR, classify based on collector and then process the document with the appropriate collector or collection model. If a specialized collector module is not contained in the server, the information will be extracted from the label using the generic model based on a random sample of labels . For this strategy to work, it is necessary to be able to categorize labels into subsets prior to the information extraction step so that the highest performance model could be used for extraction. A Naïve Bayes pre-classifier can successfully perform this task. The 200 generic Yale training set includes 15 records from the collector \"A. H. Curtiss\". The 5-fold evaluation of NB classifier trained to differentiate \"Curtiss\" from \"non-Curtiss records\" preformed well, F-Score of 97.5%. Bootstrapping is a process where a small number of examples are used to create a weak learning model. This learning model, while weak is used to process a new set of examples. When a museum staff member corrects the output, it can be added to their database. The new result can help to form a stronger model. There are fewer errors generated by this new model making it easier for the users to correct the model's errors. Museum staff who digitize records need to perform this step for key fields in any case in order to import the records to their database. These corrected examples are fed back into the process again to create an even stronger model. Successive generations of examples improve performance making it easier for the users to generate more examples. A user wishing to create their own specialized model could begin by processing a set of labels from one collector through the generic Yale model. With each iteration the performance of the specialist system would improve but initially the generic model would perform better, with fewer errors per record. At some crossover point, the performance of the specialized model would exceed that of the generic model. In the example below the crossover point is at about 80 examples. In this framework the user only needs to correct machine output for 80 records to create a model that performs as well as a random collection of 200 records. This crossover point is what the algorithm is looking for in Phase 2 step 7 below. Specialist Learning Algorithm --The steps could be described as follows: Phase 1 1. Developers create a \"generic\" model alpha, M 0 . This experiment compares the specialist model and the generic model generated from Yale 200 example collection. The dashed top line in figure 6 is the performance of 200 records independent of iteration. Regular expressions were applied to the 20,000 Yale digitized labels to identify the approximately 100 examples with the collector's name \"A. H. Curtiss\" who is a well-known collector and botanist. HLS was trained on 10 examples and then 5-fold evaluation used to measure the F-Score. This procedure was repeated 10 times, adding 10 new labels on each iteration producing a training set of 20, 30 and so on until a hundred were used in a training set. The results are presented in the solid curved line, \"Specialist Model.\" ", "meta": {"ref_id": "Greenbergetal."}}

{"text": "Among the 121 sentences, part of them were used as the training set for feature extraction and model building, and the remainder were used for evaluation. We applied the Stanford parser for parsing and chunking in the NLP phase. This step was to prepare for the machine learning part. The parsing of context sentences generated candidate features for machine learning, and when combined with features and relation labels we were able to then conduct training to derive a classifier for relations. A decision tree was the algorithm for selecting features and generating patterns for different types of relations. The resultant classifier was then ready for accepting new context for tag pairs and outputting relations. Finally, we examined the methodology by sending new tag pairs to the trained model. We withheld the other context sentences as a testing set, and input the sentences to the NLP processor and classifier accordingly. The classifier returned the relation of each tag pair as an automatic relation extraction result. Since we had the human coded results, we compared them with the machine learning results and evaluated the performance. Our preliminary experiment extracted 2401 unique features from 121 context sentences. We used a ten-fold cross-validation to evaluate the result . The evaluation result of our method displayed in Table 3 shows an 83.72% rate of correct classification / tag relation instances. While the sampling size of tag data and the number of human coded relations could not be as large as we would have liked, this approach appears to be a promising methodology. The introduction of external sources allows for objectively identifying contextual information for context-less tag data and thereby improving the accuracy and reliability of relation extraction. This result also suggests that using external sources for context information can help detect data anomalies in the tag pairs that have a high MI score. We discovered from our experiment that a high MI score did not necessarily mean that Tag X and Tag Y always had direct semantic relations. Some tag pairs did not appear in any sentence in Google search results and no context was found containing the tags. For example, the two tags Tag X = \"all rights reserved\" and Tag Y = \"Canon EOS 350\" had a high MI score, but neither of these two tags appeared together in Google search results; this suggests that no context sentence existed for the two tags. We are unsure at present how the two tags might be related, but it is possible that they are indirectly related. If, for example, they are both related to a third tag in a meaningful way, then they could be related to each other statistically but not semantically. Consequently, the two tags were semantically unrelated and the pair was removed from the tag pair collection to ensure the meaningfulness of tags and their relations. We also discovered that NLP algorithms can provide flexible and powerful features for relation identification. For instance, a syntax level feature can be helpful for identifying the \"is-locatedin\" class in an example pattern such as Tag X , Tag Y , Zip Code or Tag X prep Tag Y , where Tag X could be a city name and Tag Y a state name. The NLP algorithms then can be expanded and explored with more semantic feature types and other machine learning algorithms. Tags are a special type of subject metadata as well as a rich, powerful vocabulary source. Extracting relations between tags is the first step toward automatic subject metadata creation. An important contribution of this study was the introduction of external resources as a solution to the problem of context-less tag data. Through combining NLP and machine learning techniques we developed a set of algorithms and procedures for automatically processing the external resources, using the output to provide more objective, reliable context information for tag relation extraction. The methodology developed in this study can be applied to larger-scale research in the future as well as in research fields beyond tag relation extraction. For example, the processing and categorization of unstructured text can benefit from this methodology, as can automatic construction of an ontology and controlled vocabulary, as well as automatic mapping between tags and controlled vocabularies. The results of our approach are encouraging for tag relation extraction. We plan to improve the classifier by collecting more relation types and human-coded examples for future experiments, and eventually utilize the relations extracted to enhance subject metadata descriptions. Wikipedia defines a Tag as a 'free-text keyword' and Tagging as an 'indexing process for assigning tags to resources'. A Folksonomy is described as a shared collection of tags used on a certain platform. The term folksonomy defines a user-generated and distributed classification system, emerging through bottom-up consensus . Folksonomies became popular on the Web with social software applications such as social bookmarking, photo sharing and weblogs. A number of social tagging sites such as del.icio.us, Flickr , YouTube , CiteULike have become popular. Commonly cited advantages of folksonomies are their flexibility, rapid adaptability, free-forall collaborative customisation and their serendipity . People can in general use any term as a tag without exactly understanding the meaning of the terms they choose. The power of folksonomies stands in the aggregation of tagged information that one is interested in. This improves social serendipity by enabling social connections and by providing social search and navigation . The simplicity and ease of use of tagging however, lead to problems with current folksonomy systems . The problems can be classified in two: • Local variations: Tags have little semantics and many variations. Thus, even if a tagging activity can be considered as the user's cognitive process, the resulting set of tags does not always correctly and consistently represent the user's mental model. • Distributed variations: Most tagging systems have their own specific ways of working with and interpreting the meaning of tags. Thus if we want to aggregate tagging data from different applications or services, it's very difficult to find out the meanings and correlations between a sets of tags. These limitations are due to the lack of a uniform structure and semantic representation found in tagging systems. In this paper, we will compare existing conceptualisations of tagging activities and folksonomies, to assess their merits and thus contribute to future work in this area. Such a conceptualisation, or ontology, is intended to be used in the representation of tagging data in collaborative tagging systems. This paper begins by discussing the reasons why we need Semantic Web technologies for tagging communities. We then briefly overview existing conceptual models for tagging and propose a novel model for folksonomies. We continue by introducing existing tag ontologies and compare them using our conceptual model. Finally, we discuss the results, draw conclusions, and suggest future research areas. There have been a significant number of efforts to add more structure and semantics to conventional tagging systems. Approaches to tagging and folksonomies have been dominated by a focus on the analysis of tag usage patterns , information retrieval and navigation and social network analysis and clustering Brooks et al., 2006) based on tagging data. Golder and Herbermann collected del.icio.us data and analysed the structure and usage patterns of tagging systems. Their work discusses the distinction between collaborative tagging and taxonomies -although collaborative tagging systems have many limitations in terms of semantics and structures, it provides the opportunity to learn from one another through sharing and organising information. Marlow found that for certain users, the number of tags can become stable over time, while for others, it keeps growing. Cattuto et. al observed small world effects by analyzing a network structure of folksonomies from Bibsonomy and del.icio.us. Their work introduced the notions of clustering and characteristic path length to describe the small world effects. According to the study, folksonomies exhibit a small world structure and have a sort of social network. carried out a study to construct community-based semantics based on a tripartite model of actors, concepts, and instances. He emphasises the social context for a representation of ontologies and generates the well-known co-occurrence network of ontology learning as well as a novel semantic network based on community relationships using del.icio.us data. There are a number of debates on the merits of folksonomies when compared to ontologies and other structured vocabulary and classification systems. Despite noted differences between folksonomies and ontologies , Semantic Web technologies can be regarded as a complement to folksonomies. As free-text keywords, tags do not have exact meanings and succumb to linguistic ambiguities and variations including the human error factor. While a user may interpret a tag's semantics through using or reading it, computers cannot automatically understand the meaning, since it is not defined in a machine-readable way . Folksonomy systems do not provide a uniform way to share, exchange, and reuse tagging data among users or communities . With the use of tagging systems in constant increase, these limitations will become evermore critical. As a potential solution, Specia and Motta propose the integration of folksonomies and ontologies to enrich tag semantics. In particular, Gruber and Spivack emphasise the need for folksonomies and ontologies to work together. In general, tag ontologies can contribute in the following three areas: • Knowledge Representation Sophistication: A tag ontology can robustly represent entities and relationships that shape tagging activities. It could make the knowledge structure of tagging data explicit and facilitate the Linked Data of tagging data on the Web. • Facilitation of Knowledge Exchange: Ontologies enable knowledge exchange among different users and applications by providing reusable constructs. Thus, a tag ontology can be shared and used for separate tagging activities on different platforms. • Machine-processable. Ontologies and Semantic Web technologies in general expose human knowledge to machines in order to perform automatic data linking and integration of tagging data. Before providing a detailed comparison, we start by reviewing individual conceptual models of tagging activities that preceded our own. A tagging model needs to distinguish between entities in a tagging activity that need to be represented, and address the relationships that exist between them. After reviewing existing tagging models we discuss whether the proposed models are suitable to represent collaborative tagging activities. We then propose our extended model, which caters for the collaborative aspect of folksonomies. Many researchers Halpin, 2006; Cattuto, 2007 ) suggested a tripartite model of tagging activities. Although different authors interpret the term \"tagging\" differently, we can identify three common entities -users, tags, and resources. They form a triple that represents the Tagging Process: Tagging: ------------------------------------------------- where U is the set of users who participate in a tagging activity, T is the set of available tags and R is the set of resources being tagged. Gruber suggested an extension to model : Tagging: ------------------------ where object, tag, and tagger correspond to R, T, and U in the tripartite model. The source refers to the tag space where the tagger applies the set of tags whereas the positive/negative parameter is an attempt to represent the collaborative filtering of 'bad' tags from spammers. This tagging model has successfully been used for representing the tagging process at a semantic level. In fact, most tag ontologies have a Tagging class, based on Gruber's model, as a core concept. Existing models consider tagging as an activity where an individual user assigns a set of tags to a resource. While they provide effective ways to describe the tagging process, they do not really support collaborative tagging activities. We therefore want to provide a Folksonomy Model to represent this knowledge, where the folksonomy is considered as a collection of instances of the tagging model. Before doing so, we need to clarify the differences between simple and folksonomy-based tagging practices. Folksonomies are not created independently by individuals in isolation, but collectively by people who participate in the collaborative tagging activity. Thus, the folksonomy model has to cover all the collaborative aspects and relationships in addition to the objects associated with tagging activities. A straightforward model for a Folksonomy could be defined as follows: , user group, source, occurrence) ---------------------- where the tag set is the set of all tags being employed, the user group is a set of users who participate in the tagging activity and the source is the location where the folksonomy is utilised . The fourth parameter, occurrence, plays an important role to identify the tags' popularity. Comparing this model to the tagging model , we can identify the following similarities: the resources are not part of the Folksonomy model per se. The Folksonomy is rather applied to the collective tagging process of the resources. The tag and tagger parameters in have been replaced with a collective representation of these entities -tag set and user group. The source is still unique since a folksonomy is a multi-user approach to tagging on a single platform. In our opinion, filtering should not be represented at this level. Alternatively, given we represent multiple tags in this model, the frequencies of individual tags become important. Thus, we include the occurrence as our fifth parameter. Folksonomy: by extending to make the individual tagging activities explicit: Folksonomy: ---------------- where the last parameter reflects the collective tagging processes performed by the users of the folksonomy, where an individual tagging process is represented by: Tagging: ------------------------------------------------------ where object, tag and tagger have the same semantics as those in . Thus, our Folksonomy model now incorporates a representation for the collective tagging processes that are individually defined by the Tagging model . There is no simple criterion for the comparison of tag ontologies. For this reason, we briefly compare the tag ontologies with respect to their suitability for: • representing tagging activities and tagging data • representing features of folksonomies We will compare seven conceptualisations, keeping in mind the folksonomy model we proposed in Section 3.2. In particular, we include in our comparison a conceptualisation that we presented in our earlier work -the SCOT Ontology . The choice of the conceptualisations was based on how concrete the model is for tagging and use by online communities. Although a lot of work in analyzing folksonomies has been done in social theory and information retrieval, very few tag ontologies have been reported until today. Few 132 researchers have explicitly specified conceptualisations of tagging data in a formal language. Concerning our selection, at the time of this research only 6 of the 7 conceptualisations were actually proposed as ontologies and described in a dedicated representation language . Although Gruber's model is just defined conceptually, we include it in our comparison since many research papers have cited his model and some ontologies have been developed based on this model. The selection of ontologies we include in our comparison is shown in Table 1 . Some of the selected conceptualisations better suit the first criterion we have defined at the beginning of this section , whereas others are better suited to the second criterion . However, all conceptualisations are suitable for both criterions to varying degrees. We will now have a brief look at them individually. Gruber's work is an early attempt to conceptualise tagging activities. His model can be viewed as a first step towards a general applicable representation model for tagging. Although his model itself is not an ontology it clearly reveals a generic conceptualisation of tagging. For more details on his work we refer to Gruber describes relationships between an agent, an arbitrary resource, and one or more tags. In this model there are three core concepts such as Tagger, Tagging, and Tag to represent a tagging activity. Knerr provides the tagging concept in the Tagging Ontology and Echarte et. al propose a model for folksonomies . Since their approaches are based on the ideas of Gruber and Newman, the core elements of the ontologies are almost identical. In particular, Echarte's model extends concepts such as time, domain, visibility, type, etc., and is represented by OWL. The SCOT Ontology -Social semantic Cloud of Tags, describes the structure and semantics of tagging data and enables interoperability of tagging data among heterogeneous social websites and tagging applications. Although SCOT's main goal is to represent collaborative tagging activities, it is also suitable for representing the features of folksonomies . MOAT -Meaning of a Tag, is intended for semantic-annotation of content by providing a meaning for free-text tagging. In addition to extensions to the Tag, Tagging, and Tagger concepts from Newman's ontology, MOAT provides the Meaning class to represent custom, user-provided 'meanings' for tags. The Nepomuk Annotation Ontology is provided for annotating resources on the Social Semantic Desktop . It is not entirely dedicated to tagging practices but demonstrates the increasing importance of tagging representation in social systems. Table 1 , given the criteria discussed at the start of this section. Whereas Newman's Ontology is more inclined towards representing tagging data, and Echarte's Ontology towards representing features of folksnomies, SCOT has a higher level of sophistication in both directions. In the next section, we will detail the main entities and features that the six ontologies and Gruber's model are able to represent. We will support our conclusions in this section by exploring the suitability of the individual conceptualisations, vis-à-vis criteria and as set out in the start of this section. We start by listing and comparing the concepts and proceed by listing and comparing their features . In this section we discuss in more details the general comparison we presented in the previous section. First, we will have a look whether the individual conceptualisations are suitable for representing general tagging activities and tagging data. All models have a representation for the object, tag and tagger in our Tagging model and all except NAO have a concept representing the tagging process. In Newman's model, the tagging concept is further refined into tags:RestrictedTagging and tags:Tagging . Echarte et al. provide the Annotation class to represent the tagging activity -i.e., it is the same as tags:Tagging. Thus, the Tagging concept can be considered as a core concept of tag ontologies. Although SCOT and MOAT have different goals compared to others, they also can describe tagging by linking to the tags:Tagging class in Newman's ontology. We now consider whether the ontologies address collective tagging data and provide sufficient features of folksonomies, as described in our Folksonomy model . Some ontologies which are based on Gruber's model have been extended in order to support folksonomies. For instance, Knerr Source class to represent the source. In addition, Knerr allows a user to use foaf:Group alongside foaf:Person to describe the user group. Similarly, NAO allows the user to use nao:Party to represent the user group. MOAT does not have a class for defining it. Nevertheless they are not enough to represent folksonomies at a semantic level. SCOT is consistent with the folksonomy model and provides representations for the source, user group and tag set. In Table 2 we compare the classes provided by these conceptualisations that are relevant to our study. Additionally, we must note that although an ontology might not provide all the required representations, they can act as a \"good Semantic Web citizen\" by connecting to external vocabularies such as SIOC , FOAF , SKOS , or DC to further weave data on the Web. For example, MOAT and SCOT use the SIOC ontology extensively to describe online communities, while other ontologies do not reuse or link to external terms. In particular, although Echarte has its own classes to represent a tagging and a folksonomy, the classes do not have any relations with other RDF vocabularies. While the number of classes enhances taxonomical representations, the power of ontologies lies in the ability of representing relationships between the classes. Although most of the studied ontologies have a similar taxonomical structure, their attributes vary according to their goals and purposes. We will now have a look at the attributes provided by the ontologies, and compare their functionalities. We differ between data type attributes, which relate classes to non-conceptual data , and object type properties which provide relationships between classes. Data Type. Aside from declarative features that represent relationships among users, tags, and resources, a semantic model for folksonomies needs to provide for descriptive features that state non-conceptual values. Most surveyed tag ontologies have many attributes to describe data-type values, i.e. numerical quantities, free-text descriptions, date, time, etc. The data-type properties relevant to this work are summarised in Table 9 . A number of datatype properties are either directly or indirectly reused from the Dublin Core vocabulary. For instance Newman's ontology tags:name is a subproperty of dc:title and tags:taggedOn is a subproperty of dc:date. Only SCOT provides for the description of numerical values for entities, e.g. scot:totalTags refers to the total number of tags in a tag cloud and scot:totalItems refers to the total number of resources tagged with tags in the tag cloud. SCOT also provides properties relating to the frequency of a tag itself. Whereas the simplistic scot:ownAFrequency refers to the actual occurrence of a particular tag in a tag cloud, scot:ownRFrequency represents the percentage frequency of a tag within a particular tag cloud, relative to the total of all tag frequencies in that tag cloud. There are many attributes to describe string and literal values for a specific purpose, e.g. tags:name, tagont:prefTagLabel, nao:preLabel, and ec:hasLabel for describing tag's name. Object Type. The object type properties relevant in the context of this study are summarised in Table 4 . SCOT, Echarte and Knerr provide the possibility to define a tagging activity. In SCOT, there is no local property to describe who is involved in a tagging activity. For this purpose SCOT reuses Newman's tags:taggedBy attribute. Via SCOT one can describe who uses tags via the scot:usedBy property. Meanwhile, three ontologies have the property to identify a location or source in which the tagging occurred. TagOnt provides tagont:hasServiceDomain to link the tagging activity to the ServiceDomain, Echarte provides ec:hasSource with the Source as its range value, whereas SCOT provides scot:tagspace with a range of sioc:Site. The relation between tags and resources is defined via tags:isTagOf , nao:isTagFor , and scot:tagOf properties in theNewman, NAO and SCOT ontologies respectively. They also provide inverse properties for this relation. Defining relations between tags is one of the benefits of using an ontology to model folksonomies, since this effectively gives semantics to tags in a tag set. Nevertheless only SCOT and Newman take advantage of this possibility. Whereas Neman provides very restricted properties such as tags:equivalentTag and tags:relatedTag, SCOT provides many more attributes such as scot:spellingVariant and scot:delimited. The spelling variant property is further refined into scot:acronym, scot:plural, scot:singular and scot:synonym. In addition, the latter has further subproperties to define specific synonym types, i.e. scot:hypenatated, scot:underscored, scot:slashed, and scot:spaced. In comparison to other ontologies, SCOT specifically provides attributes that represent characteristics of folksonomies such as scot:hasUsergroup, scot:createdBy, scot:contains, and scot:taggingActivity. To conclude this section we briefly give a summary of the comparison. So far, tag ontologies have mainly been used for representing tagging activities, and only to a minor extent for modeling the features of folksonomies. According to the Folksonomy model given in Section 3.2, SCOT is suitable for this model. But, we might argue that the surveyed ontologies have different ontological purposes and different expressivity. Therefore, as an ideal solution we might need to interlink among the proposed ontologies. In the first half of this paper we proposed a model for collaborative tagging activities and folksonomies -based on the widely accepted model for tagging. The detailed comparisons presented in Section 4 support several general concluding observations about ontologies related to tagging activities and their usefulness in collaborative tagging systems. This research can be considered as a first attempt to systematically compare different conceptualisations of semantic tagging for collaborative tagging systems. We believe that tag ontologies should be evaluated with respect to a particular goal, application or scenario rather than merely for the sake of an evaluation. Our observations take into consideration two separate criteria -the depth of tagging data per se, and the collaborative aspect in folksonomies. As we mentioned in the start of the paper, tag ontologies are in an early stage and current approaches need to be elaborated or combined to enrich schemas and meet both criteria. Nevertheless the surveyed ontologies already offer an improved opportunity for collaborative tagging systems -especially given the machineprocessable representations that they can provide. Following the comparison of the tag ontologies we arrived at the following conclusions: • There is agreement on the issue as to what are the most elementary building blocks of a model for the tagging. The building blocks consist of the taggers, the tags themselves, and the resources being tagged. • Different individuals create substantially different conceptualisations of tagging data and tagging activities despite the fact that their purposes are similar. • The tag model does not cover overall characteristics of a folksonomy. SCOT, combined Gruber's conceptual model and Newman's vocabularies, is the ontology that must be suitable to represent collaborative tagging activities and it provides the most appropriate representations for the Folksonomy model as we defined it. In addition linking between SCOT and MOAT is useful way to complement to define a meaning of tag. Toward the Semantic Web DCMF: DC & Microformats, a Good Marriage During the Web 1.0 years , the usual method for including semantic information within documents was using the HTML header <meta> elements, as well as <title>, <address>, <link>, <del>, <ins> elements and \"title\" and \"cite\" attributes. This continues in the present, but the abuse and misuse of <meta> elements forces search engines to ignore this information. With the introduction and growing popularity of XML, and the first Recommendation status of W3C's RDF in February 1999 , or, historically, using special user agents like Metabrowser, which allowed the user to browse both the information and the metainformation within a webpage. Microformats originated from a grassroots movement lead by Tantek Çelik to make recognizable data items capable of automated processing by software agents, as well as directly readable by human beings . The official website of microformats.org says that they are \"designed for humans first and machines second, microformats are a set of simple, open data formats built upon existing and widely adopted standards\". A microformat is a Web-based data formatting approach seeking to re-use existing content as metadata, using only X/HTML classes and other attributes for encoding. Microformats are simple conventions for embedding semantic markup in human-readable documents. They make use of implicit and explicit X/HTML characteristics in order to add simple semantic information via: • relationship links using \"rel\" and \"rev\" attributes on <a> and <link> elements. Besides the default defined types of relationship in the HTML specification, they can also be extended using profiles. • \"class\" and \"id\" attributes of most X/HTML elements. In this case, in addition to its support for display , these attributes may be used for other different functionalities. Web developers frequently make use of meaningless values for class names and identifiers. However, source code comprehension can be enhanced and extra information added for instance using \"header\", \"menu\" and \"footer\" for page layout definition. In December 2005 Google did an analysis of a sample of slightly over a billion documents, extracting information about popular class names, elements, attributes, and related metadata. One of the goals of that project was to know if any logic or semantics were used in class names. The conclusion was that there is no uniformity in naming classes. As a consequence, it is hard to parse documents in order to extract semantic information, except when microformats are used. The main goal of microformats is to solve problems created by inconsistent labeling, for instance, defining events, people, relationships, etc. through the creation of simple elements and element sets. Some of the microformat element sets are associated with widely adopted standards or schema, such as hCard and hCalendar ; some others have a newer origin, like \"rel-tag\" microformats, used to simplify blog indexing through Technorati. There are also other globally used microformats such as \"vote-links\" for electronic voting, \"hReview\" for media reviews, \"hResume\" for resumes, and \"XFN\" for social networks, etc. One of the most obvious and important benefits of using microformats -besides easy encoding and quick distribution-is the ability to easily parse web documents to look for microformats and extract them. There are a number of Web services that exploit this semantic information such as: Technorati 28 to find Weblog posts, Upcoming.org 29 to extract hCalendar definitions of events, and Yahoo! Tech 30 publishing of products reviews etc. Yahoo! has also implemented a search engine for Creative Commons licensed documents 31 , and Yahoo! Search parses almost every defined microformat. We started the Dublin Core MicroFormats project in 2005, taking advantage of Dublin Core's versatility, general purpose applicability, its formal standardization and the wide promotion by the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative . Dublin Core is a metadata schema which is syntactic-independent so it is suitable for encoding semantics within a microformats structure. So, DCMF allow us to extend the indisputable advantages of DCMI -simplicity, flexibility, diffusion and appropriateness-to any domain. All of the microformats have been created with a concrete goal, and the general goal of DC Microformats is to describe web resources . But DC microformats are also particularly appropriate to encode bibliographic descriptions of resources, such as magazines, books, articles, in any media, including paper or digital. Let's see an example of how we can describe Tim Berners-Lee's book using semantic information encoded as DCMF. The following code will represent this information in an X/HTML webpage: <dl class=\"dublincore\"> <dt>Title:</dt> <dd class=\"title\">Weaving the Web</dd> <dt>ISBN:</dt> <dd class=\"identifier\">0062515861</dd> <dt>Author:</dt> <dd><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee\" class=\"creator\">Tim Berners-Lee</dd></dl> According to the example, to use DC microformats, we need: 1. An X/HTML element with the class or identifier \"dublincore\", which acts as container of a DC microformat and identifies it. 2. A string which represents the semantic expressed by the microformat . 3. An X/HTML element with the \"class\" or \"id\" attributes, whose value is the appropriate DC element to indicate the semantic information to machines ; and also the value of the element/property . If we declare the information expressed in the microformat in RDF nomenclature , we should speak about: resource, property and value, where: • resource, is the value of the element with \"identifier\" class or id, if it exists; • property, is the value of the class expressed for both; for humans and for machines • and value, is the content of X/HTML elements with the class or identifiers of the last item . There are many tools to extract and/or generate metadata with DCMI elements, but none allows us to create microformats, except Dublin Core Metadata Gen, which was incorporated into the DCMF project. Dublin Core Metadata Gen is an application developed in PHP that generates three kinds of DC metadata: RDF, X/HTML using <meta> elements and also, per the project presented here, DCMF. In Dublin Core Metadata Gen, you can enter the data into a template and get: DC in RDF, DC in X/HTML using <meta> elements, and DC in microformats. The Dublin Core Microformats Viewer is an add-on for Firefox and Flock browsers. This user agent's extension detects DC microformats when is then included in the X/HTML code of the webpage. Like Dublin Core Viewer Extension add-on , DC Microformats Viewer installs a little icon in the status bar, letting the users open a pop-up window containing a table with the Dublin Core microformats present in the current page. This tool is only a simple extension with simple functionality, but it also shows the ease of extracting metainformation from DC microformats, and the potential of this approach. Microformats are another way of expressing metadata in general, and DC in particular, embedded in web resources. If we compare microformats encoding with the use of <meta> elements, and/or with RDF syntax, microformats have some advantages and distinctive characteristics: • Easy to create. Microformats make participation in Web 2.0 social collaboration easier for content creators. Any web content creator can write microformats easily. The only required knowledge is basic X/HTML and X/HTML authoring tools. • Easy to recognize and use. The information can be read by people using their user agents. Users also can extend their browsers' functionalities , to combine pieces of information on websites with applications . There are also disadvantages. Probably microformats are less known than the <meta> element, because microformats belong to the emerging domain of the Web 2.0. Also microformats are more limited than RDF; for example, they can not formally define complex relationships and microformats' scope are narrower that the descriptive potential of RDF. Despite all those limitations, microformats are a way to work with DC metadata in the context of Web 2.0, allowing authors to generate semantic information easily comprehensible to both people and machines. Web services can also be developed to support DC microformats, as for any other existing microformats. Examples might include article repositories, books, magazines, etc that allow people to add and find bibliographic records easily. Microformats, have been also called as \"lower-case Semantic Web\" but they are a very important inflection point within the Semantic Web. Standards like GRRDL, a recent W3C Recommendation, demonstrate that mechanisms from Gleaning Resource Descriptions from Dialects of Languages, are needed to extract Semantic Web Information from X/HTML microformats . In a post on his blog, Stu Weibel wrote: The flexibility that microformats afford is an essential feature of the hyper-innovation that characterizes Web 2.0, but he wondered if Dublin Core fits in the microformats' philosophy. In this report we answer \"YES\": Dublin Core fits perfectly in the microformats' philosophy, just as it does in the context of the \"classic\" Semantic Web. Adopting microformats as a new way to express semantic information with DC allows us to expand the use of DC to new domains that, otherwise, would not use it. In addition, the nature of DC as a general purpose metadata model implicitly suggests its use in microformats for describing resources, especially the bibliographic types of resources previously mentioned. Microformats avoid the problems of updating and synchronizing the information in many sources or formats . But microformats especially are intended to allow people to participate in and take advantage of the Semantic Web in the specific situations already mentioned. The DCMF project intends to combine the simplicity and flexibility of Dublin Core with the possibilities that microformats offer. DCMF is an attempt to make semantic information easy and practical. Furthermore, the ease of parsing web documents with microformats lets us use this semantic information for Web services useful to people. Future work on DC microformats will be the evolution and improvement of those tools described here , and the development of Web services for querying the information within DC microformats. Even though bibliographic exchange has been a reality for decades, exchange of authority information and links between records are still not widely implemented. The standard way of making bibliographic data available is still through search-retrieve protocols such as SRU/W 32 or Z39.50 33 . Though this makes single bibliographic records retrievable, it does not provide a way to directly address them and reveals little or nothing about links between records. In contrast the Semantic Web is by definition built upon linking of information. The promise of the Semantic Web and Linked Data is that it could make data connected, simply by making it available. This, it seems, could be the perfect way for libraries to expose all of their data. A goal when creating the new version of the LIBRIS web interface 34 was to make the information presented to a normal user transparently available to machines/web robots as well. It was also obvious that information not intrinsic to the record itself, such as user annotations and connections to other records could be made available this way. Also, thirty years of continually changing cataloguing rules and practices have left some data in an inconsistent state. Our hope is that the result of the work described will help us work with data in a new and better way. The Swedish Union Catalogue comprises about 175 libraries using a single Integrated Library System for cataloguing. MARC21 is used for bibliographic, holdings and authority records. It contains about six million bibliographic records. A number of components were developed to make the ILS \"talk RDF\". We created an RDF server wrapper to make the ILS accessible through HTTP and able to deliver RDF describing bibliographic and authority resources upon request, as well as RDF describing the links between them. Persistent URIs were created by using each record's unique number, these URIs can be dereferenced and will deliver the RDF when queried properly through HTTP content negotiation. 32 Search/Retrieval via URL -http://www.loc.gov/standards/sru/ 33 Z39.50 -http://www.loc.gov/z3950/agency/ 34 LIBRIS -http://libris.kb.se/ This data could then be loaded into a triple store to enable searching using SPARQL . In this section we will outline the individual components of the implementation. A schematic is provided in FIG. 1 . The first step was to create a wrapper around the ILS that could deliver the records in RDF rather than the binary format normally used for bibliographic records . The wrapper talks to the ILS using SQL and delivers records given its unique number. It then converts the ISO2709 record into an XML representation of MARC21. In the final step a transformation is applied to the XML using XSLT . Since each output format is implemented in a single XSLT-file, adding a new format or making changes to an existing one is trivial. Links and access are crucial underpinnings of both the semantic and \"normal\" web. For a resource to be linkable it needs a URI, for it to be accessible, that URI should be a HTTP one. Following the four rules of Linked Data , a persistent, dereferenceable URI is created for each record. For bibliographic records: http://libris.kb.se/resource/bib/<number>, and for authority records: http://libris.kb.se/resource/auth/<number>. Using HTTP content negotiation, the correct format can be delivered depending on the clients capabilities. This method uses the HTTP Accept header to tell the server what media types the client can handle and prefers. For example, the accept header text/html tells the server to deliver an HTML page suitable for a human user. An accept header containing, for example, text/rdf+n3 or application/rdf+xml tells the server that the client is able to handle RDF. The server can either deliver the data in RDF directly or send an HTTP 302 or 303 response indicating that the information can be found at a different URL . See Appendix A for an example of content negotiation. We were interested in using SPARQL as a tool to both query and analyze data. Some queries that can be hard, or impossible, to formulate using SQL or a full text search language are easily formed using SPARQL. For example, the following query: \"show me all subjects of records that belongs to the same work as the record with identifier XYZ\". A query like this can be very useful for someone wanting to \"auto complete\" missing subject entries on records belonging to the same work. We used the Jena Semantic Web Framework 35 to create a triple store to hold the data. This gave us, with a minimum of work, the possibility to query data using SPARQL. A SPARQL endpoint conforming to the SPARQL Protocol for RDF was implemented to allow queries over HTTP. There are a number of types of resources that needs to be described or made available to reflect the current state of a library catalogue, e.g books, authors, subjects , organizations, links between them, etc. To make the library catalogue available to systems outside the library community, the resources should be described using common vocabularies. We used Dublin Core for bibliographic data, FOAF 36 for persons and organizations, and SKOS 37 for controlled vocabularies. These are all widely used and understood standards. An example graph is displayed in FIG. 2 . See Appendix A for example records. It is important to point out that it is possible to deliver multiple formats in parallel, so catering to the world outside the library community does not exclude systems aware of library standards. As described in 3.1 RDF Server Wrapper adding support for Bibliontology, MODS, MarcOnt or any other standard is easy, it is, however, not the subject of this paper. The Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records has been around for a decade, much has been written about it, though actual implementations are few. One hurdle to overcome is the shifting quality of the records due to continually changing practices. However, the idea of grouping or linking records being part of the same work is an appealing and technically viable one. Every record in the LIBRIS database gets assigned one or more FRBR-keys, these keys are the normalized concatenations of an author and the original title. The process is repeated for each author and title. For example, the book \"The Difference Engine\" by William Gibson and Bruce Sterling has two keys: \"GIBSON WILLIAM 1948 THE DIFFERENCE ENGINE\", and \"STERLING BRUCE 1954 THE DIFFERENCE ENGINE\". Links are then created between records with the same key. This is similar to the approach of Styles et al. where the MD5 checksum of the name of the author and the title of the work are used as an identifier. However, an important distinction compared to Styles et al. is that these keys are transient; they are never used as identifiers, only to create the links between records of the same work. This way, when an author dies, changes his/her name, etc. the links remain the same even though the keys change. There is therefore no need to keep track of changes since no identifier has been published. Another advantage is that works with more than one author is handled automatically, as well as records containing more than one work. The LIBRIS database also contains actual work records in the form of name+title authority records. These are linked to their respective bibliographic records. The sheer amount of bibliographic records prohibits manual creation of these for the whole database, nevertheless these links are included in the RDF. Linking to external resources gives the client a way of finding more information about a given resource. As a proof-of-concept the LIBRIS database contains a handful of links from authority records to DBpedia and Wikipedia. See Appendix A for an example. We have also experimented with user annotation using the annotea ontology. Since the URIs used to identify records/resources are available outside the ILS, attaching data, such as user reviews, to them is easy and non-intrusive. Although there are a number of ontologies available to describe bibliographic data, the data contained in library systems are not generally available. The access mechanisms described in Linked Data need to be implemented for libraries to truly be \"part of the semantic web\". SPARQL shows real promise when it comes to mining the bibliographic data for information due to it's linked nature. Planned next steps include using SPARQL for automatic creation of work records, implementing a richer description of bibliographic and authority records and loading more external data into the triple store. We are closely following the work of the DCMI/RDA Task Group 38 . We are currently exploring the possibility of making parts of this work available as Open Source.

Dryad is currently working collaboratively with ten leading journals that publish evolutionary biology research, including Evolution, The American Naturalist, and Ecology. These journals have agreed to integrate their submission systems with Dryad in the near future, eventually creating a seamless publication process from author to journal to Dryad data deposition. Two goals informing Dryad's current metadata activities include: 1. Dryad's need to be interoperable with other data repositories used by evolutionary biologists; and 2. Dryad's need for a sustainable information infrastructure. The first goal has inspired our development of the Dryad application profile, version 1.0; and the second goal has led to Dryad's adoption of DSpace software and technology. Current metadata activities for the Dryad development team include revising the project's application profile so that it is compliant with the Singapore Framework. The Singapore Framework is a model that was released at the 2007 Dublin Core conference approximately a year after our team created the DRIADE application profile, version 1.0 . Ongoing Dryad metadata work also includes evaluating the effectiveness of our revised application profile and integrating it into a DSpace environment. This report reviews these two metadata focused activities, and highlights recent accomplishments and challenges. Dryad's metadata application profile, ver.1.0, has two modules; one module describes data objects, and the other module describes the associating publication. We developed the application profile to support basic resource and data discovery, with the goal of being interoperable with other data repositories used by evolutionary biologists. The application profile is designed to automatically capture as much metadata as possible during publication and data deposition processing. The application profile incorporates elements from the following established metadata schemes: Dublin Core, Darwin Core, Data Documentation Initiative , Ecological Metadata Language , and PREservation Metadata Implementation Strategies . The Dryad application profile, ver. 1.0, supports Dryad's phase one functionalities that were established in a stakeholders' workshop in December 2006 42 . These functionalities include the capturing, basic preservation, and simple retrieval of datasets and metadata for associated publications. In the future, metadata elements from other metadata schemes will be needed for projected features. Dryad's phased development and corresponding functionalities are summarized in Table 1 . DSpace is a software package for digital repository systems 43 . DSpace provides basic services to deposit, store, search, and retrieve digital content, but it was designed for a particular use case , and significant modifications will be required to make DSpace suit the needs of Dryad users. Although the DSpace infrastructure has been adopted by many repositories, research on the integration of application profiles, especially those complying with the Singapore Framework, is still limited. Implementing the first iteration of the Dryad application profile in DSpace is allowing us to test the application profile, as well as evaluate the long-term applicability of DSpace for Dryad's needs. DSpace was chosen due to its adaptability and support of Dublin Core metadata, as well as the DSpace community's support for enhancing metadata functionality, as evidenced by developments such as the SKOS module. Although most DSpace functionality revolves around qualified Dublin Core metadata, the software collects additional metadata that can be used to fill in details of the application profile, including qualifiers associated with elements drawn from other metadata schemes. Metadata fields not native to DSpace are configured as custom fields, which can be stored, searched, and displayed in the same manner as the native fields. A major advantage of DSpace is its system for managing user accounts, which can be adapted for the eventual Dryad functionality of allowing end-users to submit content and create basic metadata. However, the default workflow for submitting content and generating metadata in DSpace is entirely too long and awkward for end-users, and is further complicated by the needs of the Dryad metadata model. A more configurable submission system is included in the recently released DSpace 1.5, but significant work will still be required to allow users to submit content without difficulty. One drawback of the DSpace model is that metadata with hierarchical information are not supported by the core repository. Hierarchical information, which is necessary for tracking data such as contact information for multiple authors of a publication, must be stored in an extra file attached to the object, and modifications must be made to the default DSpace functionality if any of this information is to be used beyond simple display. Another difficulty of using DSpace is the lack of a configurable access control system, a critical feature for Dryad. One requirement of Dryad is to collect and store publications to facilitate automatic metadata generation, while simultaneously shielding these publications from end-users. Some of the content stored in Dryad will need to be placed under embargo. While others have implemented these features in DSpace, the core distribution does not include them. Modifications to the core DSpace code must be kept to a minimum if we are to take advantage of future upgrades. Therefore, it will be challenging to optimize Dryad for users and metadata creators while minimizing deviation from the core DSpace platform. The Singapore Framework provides a model for the structure of Dublin Core application profiles . Conformance with the Singapore Framework includes the benefits of consistency, long-term quality control, and interoperability with other metadata structures. A significant effort over the last few months has been to bring the Dryad application profile, ver. 1, which is based largely on Dublin Core, in line with the Singapore Framework. Reasons for this step include the benefits noted by Nilsson, et al. , as well as, our goal to comply and interoperate with Semantic Web standards. All five Singapore Framework components have been examined for the Dryad metadata schema adaptation . The five components include the following: 1. Functional requirements; 2. Domain model; 3. Description Set Profile; 4. Usage guidelines; and 5. Encoding syntax guidelines. With the exception of the optional encoding syntax guidelines, the other four components have been deemed appropriate for the Dryad's application profile revision. The Scholarly Works Application Profile 44 is a key example of an application profile in conformance with the Singapore Framework, and provides a model for the Dryad description. The results of the initial restructuring can be found online as part of the repository project wiki. Addressing the Singapore Framework's first mandatory component, Dryad's functional requirements are based on project system requirement specifications. Using the SWAP example as a model, the Dryad's functional requirements address scope, stakeholders and designated community, requirements gathering, and functional requirements. Dryad's functional requirements include supporting the following operations: 1. resource discovery and use; 2. data interoperability; 3. computer-aided metadata generation and augmentation; 4. linking publications and underlying datasets; 5. data and metadata quality control; and 6. Data security. The designated community for the Dryad application profile includes researchers in the field of evolutionary biology who are generating data and reusing data for their own projects and scientists searching for datasets that are applicable to their own research. Stakeholders are evolutionary biologists, journal publishers in the field of evolutionary biology, professional societies in evolutionary biology, and NESCent. The methodology employed to gather system requirements involved assessing the needs and goals of individuals and groups identified as stakeholders and community members through a workshop held in December 2006 at NESCent in Durham, North Carolina, and more recently an ongoing use case study. Full details about the application profile functional requirements have been added to the Dryad project wiki46.The second mandatory component of the Singapore Framework is the domain model. Unlike the SWAP example, the Dryad application profile is \"data-centric\" rather than document-or publication-centric. Dryad's application profile, ver. 1.0, accommodates a single publication or article with published data from one or more datasets. This relationship is represented in Figure 2 . The third mandatory component, the Description Set Profile is proving to be the most challenging aspect of the application profile revision process. As previously mentioned, the Dryad application profile is based largely on Dublin Core, but also incorporates elements from domain-specific namespaces such as PRISM, DDI, EML, and DarwinCore. None of the namespaces, except Dublin Core, are currently represented in RDF and cannot be included in the DSP. The Dryad development team has been discussing whether or not to declare unique elements for Dryad use in order to complete the Description Set Profile. Despite this challenge, the first draft of the Dryad DSP, which only includes Dublin Core elements, is available for viewing 47 . The fourth component, which is optional, is the usage guidelines, which have been collaboratively developed by Dryad team members and also appear online. The Dryad usage guidelines provide descriptions of each element and details regarding use 48 . Additionally, the guidelines also elaborate upon the constraints defined by the DSP. The application profile revisions undertaken to comply with the Singapore Framework has strengthened the overall metadata architecture of the Dryad repository. It has also helped the project team identify key challenges, such as limitations in the current state of citation metadata, and the project's need to encode rights metadata. Furthermore, it has aided the Dryad development team in identifying metadata issues, and clarifying those issues that require administrative or policy decision, prior to determining the appropriate metadata element or value. The most pressing issue facing the Dryad team is to determine how or if elements from non-Dublin Core namespaces should be included in the Dryad DSP and how the elements will be represented during DSpace implementation. The inclination is to use what has already been determined by a community to be useful, and furthermore to take advantage of the work and documentation already available from other initiatives; however, the issues with interoperability remain unavoidable at this time. Therefore, the Dryad team may choose to declare unique elements for the repository project. The benefits of moving forward in line with the Singapore Framework are critical to the longterm success of Dryad and its ability to take advantage of metadata to improve system performance. The ongoing revision of the Dryad application profile, ver. 1, will result in the release and publication of the Dryad application profile, ver. 2.0. As part of our application profile development work, we are also taking into account selected functionalities of Dryad's phase two . Additional ongoing activities include revising Dryad's interface for entering metadata and streamlining the metadata creation and submission process to support authordepositors. As Dryad evolves, we are anticipating that the recent release of DSpace 1.5 will impact the amount of work the project is able to complete with respect to specific metadata goals and other desired functionalities. In conclusion, Dryad's metadata structure is evolving, and will be revised over time, taking into consideration Semantic Web standards and innovations that support the overall goals of Dryad. Effective metadata standards are required to efficiently handle the large amounts of data collected in imaging and scholarly studies of the earliest known copy of Archimedes' work. The Dublin Core Metadata Element Set is being utilized to provide key identification information, with additional metadata extensions to ensure the imaging and scholarly information can be readily integrated in a Web 2.0 environment. Applying the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative Metadata Element Set and additional elements from the DCTerms namespace to a variety of images containing different texts in a rapidly changing technology environment has posed a unique set of challenges. These challenges include linking together and integrating data from different sources and formats: Digital images from advanced cameras in numerous spectral bands, and digitally encoded texts in varied fonts from a team of scholars. With increased focus on data management and explosive growth in data with advanced imaging techniques, the application of the DCMI Metadata Element Set provides a robust data set that will meet worldwide metadata standards. The Archimedes Palimpsest Program is a 10-year effort to produce digital images of Archimedes' text as originally written on parchment in the latter half of the tenth century. In the early thirteenth century, this text was scraped off and overwritten, or \"palimpsested,\" to create a prayer book. A team of scientists and scholars has been digitally imaging and studying the 174 parchment leaves that currently make up the Archimedes Palimpsest. Since the 2006 Dublin Core Conference the program has developed new imaging techniques that have yielded over two terabytes of data. This includes images of the only copies of Archimedes treatises The Method and Stomachion; the only copy in Greek of On Floating Bodies; and copies of the Equilibrium of Planes, Spiral Lines, The Measurement of the Circle, and Sphere and Cylinder. Imaging has also revealed ten leaves of text by the fourth century B.C. Greek orator Hyperides; six leaves of commentaries on Aristotle; four liturgical leaves; and twelve leaves from two unidentified books. At the time of the 2006 Dublin Core Conference, the imaging team had imaged the entire palimpsest with three spectral bands of light, yielding three images for each leaf and processed \"pseudocolor\" images in what was then considered to be a large data set of about 240 Gigabytes of data. Since the 2006 conference, the imaging team developed new imaging techniques to yield more information with more advanced cameras and lighting in 12 spectral bands. These yielded 16 images of each leaf and more refined processed images with a total of about 2,400 GB of data. Managing all this data required careful metadata logging and data management based on the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set. The Archimedes Palimpsest team also created images of key leaves at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory using X-ray fluorescence. This required an extensive range of metadata extensions to capture the broad range of metadata on energy levels and system parameters. They also imaged original prints of photographs of the Archimedes Palimpsest taken almost 100 years earlier at the direction of John Ludwig Heiberg in Constantinople, and photographs of one leaf taken in Chicago in the 1930's. These images of the photographs offered standardized images of text that has since been lost, and one leaf that has been lost in its entirety. With 6,797 digital images and 130 pages of transcriptions of the Archimedes Palimpsest, metadata has proved to be essential for 1) accessing images and integrating spectral bands for digital processing and enhancement, 2) managing transcriptions from those images for study by scholars around the world, and 3) linking and integrating the images and the transcriptions. This work required extensive identification metadata to ensure the data was manageable, as well as spatial metadata to line up and register the various images. The Dublin Core Metadata Element Set offers the key identification elements required for image storage, management and retrieval, with additional spatial and spectral information added as extensions. The \"Identification,\" \"Data Type\" and \"Data Content\" metadata elements incorporate the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set. The \"Spatial Data Reference\" and \"Imaging and Spectral Data Reference\" elements are extensions to the DCMI Standards, using metadata elements detailed in the Federal Geographic Data Committee Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata. The standard is hosted on the www.archimedespalimpsest.org website. In keeping with the project goals of long term data and metadata accessibilty, the program follows the DCMI's principble of simplicity. We have created records that are machine-readable with very little effort and easily intelligible by a human reader. Each image metadata record is a series of simple name-value pairs, employing Dublin Core and project-specific metadata elements . Since the 2006 Dublin Core Conference, individuals with standards experience in OCLC and other organizations have provided input on the best application of the Dublin Core Standard to the Archimedes Palimpsest Metadata Standard. A range of organizations have also provided guidance on the use of standards for archival purposes, including guidance for the best use of standards in the digital data set to ensure users years hence will have access to the actual versions of the standards used in creating the data set. Input from the Library of Congress, the British Library, NASA and Google proved fruitful in defining the application of standards not only to the Web 2.0 environment, but the range of possible digital environments possible in decades to come. Scholars have been transcribing the Greek text since the initial digital imaging, revealing new information about the origins of mathematical theories and science. The integration of these scholarly transcriptions in digital form with the digital images has taken on greater impetus since the 2006 Dublin Core Conference, with the digital tagging and encoding of text in various forms and formats, including handwritten, MSWord Symbol font, and various other custom fonts. A team of scholars and students is encoding the transcribed text into XML tagged Unicode following the Text Encoding Initiative standards . <seg TEIform=\"seg\" n=\"17v1\" part=\"N\" type=\"folio\"> <seg TEIform=\"seg\" n=\"1\" part=\"N\" type=\"line\"> <supplied TEIform=\"supplied\" reason=\"lost\"> <expan TEIform=\"expan\">ὅτι</expan> τὸ ΦΑ</supplied> μέγε<supplied TEIform=\"supplied\" reason=\"lost\">θος</supplied> τῶι βάρει πρὸς </seg> <seg TEIform=\"seg\" n=\"2\" part=\"N\" type=\"line\"> <supplied TEIform=\"supplied\" reason=\"lost\">τὸ ὑγρ</supplied>ὸν τὸ ἰσόογκον τοῦτον ἔχει</seg> <seg TEIform=\"seg\" n=\"3\" part=\"N\" type=\"line\">τὸν λόγον, ὃν τὸ Α <expan TEIform=\"expan\">πρὸς</expan> τὸ Φ<unclear TEIform=\"unclear\" >Α</unclear>.</seg> </seg> Header information is provided for each folio in the encoded text, with cross-walked Dublin Core Identification and Data Content metadata elements mapped to the TEI format . These encoded texts are then hosted with the images, with the Dublin Core elements providing a common structure for image and transcription metadata. The images and transcriptions are linked through metadata in the Archimedes Palimpsest Data Product, enabling common searches, access and study. The standard use of the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set across the products of the image scientists and scholars enables linkage between these two disparate data sets for further study . Integrating metadata of various types tailored to meet a range of users' needs has proven critical to making integrated data available across domains and disciplines amidst ever changing technologies. Building on the Archimedes Palimpsest application, the DCMI Standards are being used to integrate hyperspectral imaging of the Waldseemuller 1507 Map at the Library of Congress. The DCMI Standards serve as the basis for information discovery in the Web 2.0 environment, and hopefully for decades to come in future formats and technologies. This information will advance the study of the original manuscript by individuals around the world with ubiquitous access via the Internet. It has long been recognized that contextual metadata is important for facilitating access to documents in archival collections . More recently, digital collections have come to be understood as information seeking contexts through \"unitary\" 49 and \"analytic\" 50 descriptive approaches . Cultural heritage institutions have purposefully conceptualized and developed their digital collections in many ways, as \"displays\", \"tours\", \"tools\", \"lessons\", and to provide a record of cultural events . However, in a large digital federation or aggregation, the purpose of the original, deliberately built collections becomes difficult to discern. Collectionlevel metadata has the potential to provide important information about features of a parent collection and why it might be of value to users. But the qualitative aspects of collections are difficult to describe in a systematic way, as they may embody a good deal of intellectual intent and tend to be highly complex and mutable. This paper reports on the current phase of the Digital Collections and Content project that is investigating how to represent collection context for scholarly use of large-scale, heterogeneous digital aggregations. The DCC provides integrated access to over 200 digital 49 Defined as: \"consists only of information about the collection as a whole.", "meta": {"ref_id": "Greenbergetal."}}
{"text": "67 See for example . The authors, after evaluating different APIs for distributed KOS access, criticize the fact that most APIs mimic the data structure of the KOS too closely and don't support advanced operations like \"chunking\", i.e., the retrieval of a defined set of concepts with one request to the server. Steering clear of the intricate philosophical problem if a group of things constitutes an information resource while the things alone do not, the cited sources all suggest that concepts of a KOS should be treated as abstract objects . To represent that fact, the {resource} segment has been introduced into the URI to distinguish between the abstract DDC concept and a description of that concept. While http://dewey.info/class/338.4 indentifies the concept, http://dewey.info/ class/338.4/about identifies the information resource describing this concept. Since this last URI is designed to be representation-agnostic and provides links to more specific resources, it is in fact the generic representation of this resource. The benefit of pointing the agent to a generic information resource before negotiating the contents of the representation is mainly semantic. By using this technique it is made clear that all descriptions of the identified resource are variants of the same representation and roughly convey the same information. The relationship of each of those resources to the generic resource is such that they specify one or more dimensions of its genericity. For example, in our context http://dewey.info/class/338.4/about exemplifies an identifier for a generic resource, being about an abstract concept. The relationship between the URI and the representation of the resource it identifies may change over time, with respect to language and format requested. The use of the same URI will still be valid, however, because these new resources are considered more specific versions of the generic resource, and their respective relationships would be given as RDF statements about the dimension they specify. On the other hand, the resource that http://dewey.info/class/338.4/2008/04/03/about identifies or retrieves is only time-invariant but language-and format-generic, whereas for http:// dewey.info/class/338.4/2008/04/03/about.en.skos it is completely fixed. It should also be noted in this context that removing the language from the concept URI implies that a specific language version of a DDC concept can never be addressed as an abstract concept, but only as an information resource describing the abstract concept. The concept of generic resources is especially important for designating a canonical URI for a given set of resources/representations. The findings above suggest that a candidate for a canonical URI should identify the most generic in a set of resources that can be grouped together as variants of each other. There are numerous DDC entities that have not been addressed so far and will therefore not be addressable by the URIs shown above. That doesn't mean that they won't be accessible to applications, however. Even if one assumes that these entities might be irrelevant from a service perspective, it would perhaps be useful to achieve higher granularity for users of the full Dewey data file; and in representation formats like SKOS, every reference has to be a URI, anyway. One possibility would therefore be to use opaque URIs in the http://dewey.info/id namespace in parallel, which, for all entities that already have other identifiers, would have to be handled as URI aliases. This set could correspond directly and exhaustively to entities in the Dewey database as represented in MARC Classification and Authorities formats, its entities could be related by OWL and even be used publicly for permalinks. Another solution: the proposed scheme might be extended by adding fragment identifiers, enabling access to specific pieces of information beyond the level of the suggested URIs, for example, http://dewey.info/class/1--012/e22/about#caption to just indentify the caption \"Classification\" of that class, but these specific entities might be misleading if applied across different data formats , e.g., MARC Classification vs. SKOS. Another potential drawback is that fragment identifiers are stripped from the URI by the user agent, so a service endpoint will never see them. The usefulness of \"shortcuts\" has to be addressed in general as well. Every time a \"default\" is introduced, the expressiveness of the scheme is impoverished by de facto defining URI aliases for some resources. If http://dewey.info/concept/338.4 defaults today to the same representation that is retrieved by http://dewey.info/ concept/338.4/2008/04/04/about.en.html, the possibility is lost to use the original URI as a canonical identifier for the 338.4 concept independently of time, language, or format. Yet such an identifier is a powerful tool that could retrieve all information about translations, former versions of this concept etc. as OWL or RDF expressions, making it possible for an agent to just work from this resource for any given concept. A better general way of indicating shortcuts would be to interpret an unspecified {aspect} segment as trigger for defaulting behavior, for example: only http://dewey.info/338.4 would be defined as an alias of the fixed resource shown above, but not http://dewey.info/concept/338.4. The European Union has 23 official languages; many more regional and minority languages are spoken in the 27 member states. A 2006 European Commission/Eurobarometer study revealed that \"56% of EU citizens are able to hold a conversation in a language other than their mother tongue\", \"28% state that they master two languages along with their native language\", and \"approximately 1 in 10 respondents has sufficient skills to have a conversation in three languages\". In this linguistically diverse and multilingual environment in the EU, there is a tremendous need to provide cross-language access to information . However, European libraries not only do not share a language, they also have no common subject heading system, classification system, authority files, or bibliographic format. Thus, cross-language access to information in library collections is a complex and difficult problem involving not only natural language analysis and translation, but also the mapping of library subject headings, classifications, and bibliographic formats, presenting problems of both syntactic and semantic interoperability. The CACAO Project , begun in December 2007, is a 24-month targeted project supported by the eContentplus Programme of the European Commission. It is a consortium of nine partners: Cité des sciences et de l'industrie and Xerox Research Centre Europe from France; the Free University of Bozen-Bolzano, CELI, and Gonetwork from Italy; Kórnik Library from Poland; the National Széchényi Library and the Hungarian Academy of Sciences from Hungary; and Goettingen State and University Library of Germany. The libraries in the CACAO consortium use a total of at least six different subject heading systems and five different classification systems . Three of the libraries are multilingual libraries. CACAO will modify and extend work that has already been implemented at the Library of the Free University of Bozen-Bolzano, a multilingual library having major collections in Italian, German, and English, each with its own subject heading system, as described by Bernardi et al. . This report reviews two of the important metadata-related challenges that CACAO faces involving the specification of the language of the metadata fields, \"false friends\" and term ambiguity, and discusses our solutions. We begin with a short description of the CACAO architecture. Figure 1 -Architecture Overview , pg. 4) The CACAO architecture in Figure 1 is designed to support the following vision. A user should be able to enter a monolingual query, say cat in English, and retrieve highly relevant records not just in English, but also in any supported language in the database, including records containing, for example, the German word for cat, Katze, French chat, Hungarian macska, Italian gatto, or Polish kot. As a least-common-denominator solution, CACAO will harvest metadata through library OAI-PMH interfaces, minimally in Dublin Core; MARC 21 may also be accepted if available. The CACAO Corpus Analysis Subsystem performs a variety of analyses on the metadata off-line, the results of which are stored locally and used in support of online Query Processing. When the user enters a query, the Query Processing Subsystem, with the assistance of third-party Web Services providing linguistic analyses, translations, etc., translates and expands the query and matches it against the results of the Corpus Analysis Subsystem. Of course, resources such as lexica, multilingual dictionaries, and thesauri and other controlled vocabularies are accessed by the subsystems. We will use a simple example to illustrate some metadata-related problems that arise and some of the possible solutions that we are investigating; these are issues that are challenges not just for CACAO, but also for the library community. Suppose a user enters the query stove, wanting to retrieve records containing the English word stove or the German translation Herd. USER QUERY: stove The procedure might seem to be very simple: the Query Processing Subsystem looks up English stove in the English-German dictionary, retrieves the German translation Herd, and builds a Boolean search query containing those two expressions: QUERY: stove or Herd However, this simple query also retrieves false hits containing the English word herd: FALSE HIT: <dc:title>Animal status monitoring and herd management</dc:title> CORRECT: <dc:title>Herd und Ofen im Mittelalter</dc:title> CORRECT: <dc:title>The Stove-Top Cook Book</dc:title> English herd and German Herd are \"false friends\", i.e., words in different languages that look similar but that have different meanings. False friends are fairly common, for example English gift-German Gift , English pain-French pain , and English cane-Italian cane . Knowing or being able to determine the language of the terms in a given metadata field increases precision when dealing with false friends. The language would optimally be provided in the metadata itself, as we might find in a German-language catalog which owns the Englishlanguage book The Stove-Top Cook Book to which German-and English-language subject headings are assigned: <dc:title xml:lang=\"en\">The Stove-Top Cook Book</dc:title> <dc:subject xml:lang=\"de\">Herd</dc:subject> <dc:subject xml:lang=\"en\">Stove</dc:subject> In the case of a subject term, information about the source of the term in the <dc:subject> field could provide enough information to be able to deduce the language. In this case, we could deduce the language with a fairly high degree of certainty from the fact that the SWD is a German-language subject heading system: <dc:subject xsi:type=\"cacao:SWD\">Herd</dc:subject> This information about the language of the content of the field will be used by CACAO in presenting the ranked results list. Since the German term Herd appears in German-language fields in this record: <dc:title xml:lang=\"de\">Herd und Ofen im Mittelalter</dc:title> <dc:subject xsi:type=\"cacao:SWD\">Herd</dc:subject> it would be ranked higher than a record in which the false friend of the German translation of the original search term appears in an English-language field. Alternatively, such a record could be excluded entirely from the results list. <dc:title xml:lang=\"en\">Animal status monitoring and herd management</dc:title> 3.3. Solution 3: Association to a Class However, metadata are not always enriched with language or authority attributes as they are in this ideal catalog. CACAO's technical partners are developing a solution for this scenario, the association of terms to a fairly broad class in a library classification system such as the Dewey Decimal Classification . In our example, the off-line Corpus Analysis Subsystem must have been able to determine that materials about stoves are commonly classed in, e.g., DDC 640 , and it has stored this association: stove:DDC 640. One option would be to organize the results list according to class. For instance, records containing the terms stove or Herd with a <dc:subject xsi:type=\"dcterms:DDC\"> element having the DDC value provided by the Corpus Analysis Subsystem, 640: <dc:title>Herd und Ofen im Mittelalter</dc:title> <dc:subject xsi:type=\"dcterms:DDC\">640</dc:subject> would be presented in a group which would be ranked higher than groups of records containing one of those terms with some other DDC value for the <dc:subject> element, including records containing the false friend. <dc:title>Animal status monitoring and herd management</dc:title> <dc:subject xsi:type=\"dcterms:DDC\">630</dc:subject> The association to a class technique is used in information retrieval and in CACAO for an even more common problem: term ambiguity. The English word pipe, for instance, is ambiguous, meaning either \"a long tube\", German Rohr, or \"a device for smoking\", German Pfeife. For purposes of exposition, assume that on entering pipe as a search query, the user is asked which meaning is intended and that the user selects the meaning \"a long tube\". Using the association to a class technique, the Corpus Analysis Subsystem has determined that relevant materials are often classed in DDC 690 . Again, one option would be to organize the results list according to class, similar to the stove/Herd example. Records containing the terms pipe or Rohr and including a <dc:subject xsi:type=\"dcterms:DDC\"> element having the DDC value provided by the Corpus Analysis Subsystem, 690: <dc:title>Plumbers and pipe fitters library</dc:title> <dc:subject xsi:type=\"dcterms:DDC\">690</dc:subject> would be presented in a group which would be ranked higher than groups of records containing one of those terms with some other value for the <dc:subject> element, including records containing the term pipe in its unintended meaning: <dc:title>The pleasures of pipe smoking</dc:title> <dc:subject xsi:type=\"dcterms:DDC\">390</dc:subject> Association to a class can also be used to disambiguate an ambiguous target term. For instance, the English search term dog translated into Italian is cane. However, Italian cane has two senses, \"dog\" and \"cock of a weapon\", which would be disambiguated in the same way. Records containing the terms dog or cane and including a <dc:subject xsi:type=\"dcterms:DDC\"> element having the DDC value 630 would be presented in a group which would be ranked higher than groups of records containing one of those terms with some other value for the <dc:subject> element, including records containing the term cane in its unintended meaning. We have argued that the specification of the language of the metadata field, in addition to that of the document itself, is very important so that metadata can be fully exploited for crosslanguage purposes or in multilingual settings. If the metadata do not come with or cannot be enriched with the languages of the fields, then CACAO must rely on the association to a class technique, which will be needed in any case. Association to a class was originally designed for and will be used as a solution to the term ambiguity problem; it is similar to synsets used in WordNet and EuroWordNet, which CACAO may also use. The solution involving association to a class may also work as association to a subject heading, although that would require further preparation and testing. It is important to note that in the association to a class technique, the CACAO Corpus Analysis Subsystem must be able to associate a term such as English stove to some class and then the system must be able to match potential hits containing a term such as Herd against that same class. In other words, either the systems must contain the same classification system or their classification or subject headings systems must be mappable to the same system. Thus, CACAO's experience with cross-language access so far strongly supports Koch, Neuroth, and Day ; NKOS ; Chan and Zeng ; ; and many others in the library community who have discussed the importance of the interoperability of subject vocabularies and of classification systems for information retrieval in cross-domain environments. CACAO will rely on already existing mappings such as those provided by the MACS project , which has worked on mappings for RAMEAU , Library of Congress Subject Headings , and Schlagwortnormdatei . For optimal performance, even if the metadata of a given collection does not contain the specification for the language of the field as outlined in section 3.2, the Corpus Analysis Subsystem must still have access to such enriched metadata in order to avoid the false friends problem in its off-line analyses. For instance, if the Corpus Analysis Subsystem must determine which class German Gift \"poison\" is most commonly associated with, then it should avoid analyzing fields in which the English gift is found. However, we anticipate that the Corpus Analysis Subsystem will have access to a more extensive stored collection of associations between terms and classes than might be available for a given collection. A prototype of the CACAO information retrieval system was entered in the CLEF 2008 campaign, providing an opportunity to tune and evaluate the system on cross-language library metadata. CACAO's attention will soon turn to related issues involving metadata exchange and interoperability and thereby further explore the characteristics of Dublin Core in its crosslanguage duties. The European Library, whose Application Profile is Dublin Core-based, will integrate and evaluate CACAO technologies beginning in late 2008. Furthermore, CACAO libraries will be grouped into a single portal and CACAO will additionally create several thematic portals in order to further develop, demonstrate, and promote CACAO technologies. Other challenges include the complex relationships caused by differences of granularities of two original schemes and their presentation with various levels of SKOS elements; as well as the diverse coordination of entries due to the use of auxiliary tables and pre-coordinated headings derived from combining classes, subdivisions, and thesaurus terms, which do not correspond to existing unique identifiers. The poster reports the progress, shares the sample SKOS entries, and summarizes problems identified during the SKOS encoding process. Although OWL Lite and OWL Full provide richer expressiveness, the cost-benefit issues and the final purposes of encoding CCT raise questions of using such approaches. Simon Spero UNC Chapel Hill, USA ses@unc.edu Keywords: LCSH; Controlled vocabularies; Hierarchical relationships; visualization The Library of Congress Subject Headings has been developed over the course of more than a century, predating the semantic web by some time. Until the 1986, the only concept-toconcept relationship available was an undifferentiated \"See Also\" reference, which was used for both associative and hierarchical connections. In that year, in preparation for the first release of the headings in machine readable MARC Authorities form, an attempt was made to automatically convert these \"See Also\" links into the standardized thesaural relations. Unfortunately, the rule used to determine the type of reference to generate relied on the presence of symmetric links to detect associatively related terms; \"See Also\" references that were only present in one of the related terms were assumed to be hierarchical.

{"text": "However, the type species of Dittodus may not pertain to the m ooref ' group sensu Schneider and indeed, probably does not. The next youngest available name is Pleuracanthus parvidens Woodward, based on a skeleton with poorly preserved teeth from the Middle Triassic of Australia . Most recent workers, including Johnson and Cappetta , tentatively consider P. parvidens distinct from \"moorei,\" although probably only at the species level. Schneider's revisions of xenacanth sharks focused on Paleozoic taxa but uphold the generic distinction of \"-m oorer teeth. This leaves the taxonomy of the Triassic xenacanths still unresolved. The principal problem is that Triassic xenacanths are generically distinct from Paleozoic xenacanths, including Xenacanthus itself . Unfortunately, the only other genus name used to describe Triassic xenacanths is Pleuracanthus which is itself based on a skeleton with poorly preserved teeth that were not illustrated by Woodward and have not been illustrated since. Therefore, I use \"Xenacanthus\" when discuss ing teeth that obviously pertain to the moorei group\" of Schneider . Hybodontoid sharks are the most common non-xenacanth chondricthyans in Chinle Group micro vertebrate faunas . O f these, the most common taxa are the polyacrodont Lissodus and the hybodont Hybodus. Here, I use the nomenclature o f Duffin to describe isolated hybodontiform teeth, particularly those of Lissodus . The only recent substantial work on Chinle osteichthyans outside of Murry , who placed fish localities into a biostratigraphic framework. Higher-level taxonomy of osteichthyans here follows McCune and Schaeffer , with minor modifications discussed where applicable . Most actinopterygian fossils described here are teeth and scales that are not diagnostic below the family level, so I limit more detailed taxonomic treatment to rel evant portions of the text where I describe more diagnostic specimens. An exception is the brief note below on colobodontids and perleidids. Sarcopterygians in the Chinle Group include both dipnoans and coelacanths. Lungfish toothplates are diag nostic to species, and are also briefly described later in this section. OSTEICHTHYES Huxley, 1880 ACTINOPTERYGII Klein, 1885 REDFIELDIFORMES Berg, 1940 REDFIELDIIDAE Berg, 1940 PALAEONISCIDAE Vogt, 1852 HALECOSTOMI Regan, 1923 SEMIONOTIFORMES Arambourg and Bertin, 1958 SEMIONOTIDAE Woodward, 1890 PERLEIDIFORMES Berg, 1937 COLOBODONTIDAE Stensio, 1916 SARCOPTERYGII Romer, 1955 ACTINISTIA Cope, 1871 DIPNOI MUller, 1844 CERATODONTIDAE, GILL 1872 Arganodus Martin COELACANTHOIDEI Berg, 1937 COELACANTHIDAE Agassiz, 1843 Generically indeterminate tooth plates containing numerous tiny phyllodont teeth are common microvertebrate fossils from the Chinle Group. Johnson and Zidek demonstrated that eight lineages of teleosts have such teeth, although most workers have assigned Chinle specimens to either the Perleididae or Colobodontidae argued that Colobodontidae is a senior synonym of Perleididae, and thus all records of perleidids are instead records of colobodontids. I follow Gardiner and Hunt . Martin revised the genus Ceratodus and, based on specimens from the Triassic of Morocco, erected the genus Arganodus for teeth with a morphology similar to C. dorotheae. Chinle workers followed this termi nology, removing \"dorotheae\" from Ceratodus and placing it in Arganodus . Murry provided exhaustive measurements of Chinle specimens, establishing the validity of the species A. dorotheae based on criteria formulated by Martin . Subsequent workers have criticized Martin's work, particularly his reliance on the angles between toothplate ridges , but all appear agreed that Arganodus is genetically distinct from Ceratodus and other named lungfish. Particularly relevant is Kemp's revision of Ceratodus, wherein it is clear that Ceratodus always has a substantial crushing surface on the occlusal portion of the toothplate, some thing clearly lacking in the Chinle lungfish . I retain the grade \"Amphibia\" for all non-amniote tetrapods. Thus, this includes both temnospondyl amphibians and lissamphibians , even though the exact origin of the latter remains unclear. The important point here is that at least some non-amniote tetrapods are present, and this has paleoecological implications. All workers recognize that Amphibia is paraphyletic, Temnospondyli is almost certainly paraphyletic, and that Lissamphibia may be polyphyletic . Therefore, I retain the grade \"Amphibia\" as a less ambiguous term than any of the names of various clades or purported clades of non-amniote tetrapods. With the advent of cladistic methods, the term \"Reptilia\" has fallen out of favor and is subsumed by \"Amniota,\" although I will continue to use Reptilia in the \"Systematic Paleontology\" sections. Amniote groups represented here include primitive amniotes , rare synapsids , and diapsids, which are divisible into lepidosauromorphs and archosauromorphs . I recognize cynodonts by their polycuspate teeth. Other Triassic tetrapods with polycuspate teeth include some derived procolophonids , some basal pterosaurs, particularly Eudimorphodon ranzii , and other less common taxa such as Trilophosaurus and Tricuspisaurus . Procolophonid molariform teeth are readily separated from all but traversodontid 33 cynodonts by their transversely broadened structure and the fact that they seldom possess more than two cusps. Polycuspate pterosaur teeth do not resemble traversodontids at all, but are similar to dromatheriids and other cynodont groups with relatively simple, secto rial teeth lacking lateral cingulae or cuspules. Trilophosaurus and Tricuspisaurus both have distinctive dentitions that, while polycuspate, are not readily confused with those of cynodonts .

This technique, while effective, is difficult to apply without sectioning one of 35 the teeth in question, so I have not utilized it here, although I have used it on larger cynodont specimens in the Chinle . Therefore, I rely primarily on morphological details to differentiate cynodont teeth from those of pterosaurs and procolophonids. Furthermore, although cynodonts are rare in the Chinle, they are still much more common than pterosaurs in Upper Triassic strata both in the Chinle and worldwide . Tooth-bearing fragments that are either pleurodont or acrodont pertain to lepidosauromorphs sensu Gauthier . I treat each specimen sepa rately relying primarily on the work of Fraser for sphenodontids. As a subset of this study, Harris et al. published a preliminary review of Chinle sphenodontians, relying primarily on material from the MNA previously described by Tannenbaum , Kirby . Results here supersede those of Harris et al. . Within the sphenodontian lepidosaurs, I follow the terminology of Robinson to identify specific types of teeth. Robinson determined that in the only extant sphenodontian, Sphenodon, there are three sets of teeth that develop during ontogeny, which she termed initial or hatchling, successional, and additional teeth. The first is an initial dentition, followed by successional teeth that replace some of the anterior hatchling teeth, and finally additional teeth that are added posterior to the initial teeth during ontogeny. Portions of all three sets of teeth may be present in an adult sphenodontian. Ben Edwards of University College provided SEM images of several typical reptiles from the fissure-fills at Ruthin and Cromhall in Britain, including Tricuspisaurus, an unnamed lepidosaur, and the sphenodontians Planocephalosaurus, Diphydontosaurus, and Clevosaums. These images were invaluable for comparison of Chinle sphenodonts, and are the material cited in this work as Edwards . Similarly, Nick Fraser of the Virginia Museum of Natural History provided specimens of Clevosaurus and Planocephalosaurus from Cromhall that Jerry Harris and I examined under the SEM. Reference to this material is made as Fraser . In the past, large numbers of teeth from the Chinle were exceedingly difficult to identify below the level of \"Reptilia, indeterminate,\" or \"thecodont.\" ", "meta": {"ref_id": "Heckert"}}

Etymology: After Phil Murry, for his diverse contributions to the microvertebrate paleontology of the Chinle Group, particularly with regard to sharks. Type locality: NMMNH locality 1430, Crosby County, Texas . Type horizon: Lower Tecovas Formation, Chinle Group . Diagnosis: Selachian that is similar to Lissodus and differs from other selachians in possessing an elongate, smooth, low-crowned tooth. Differs from Lissodus in possessing two robust labial pegs, each slightly offset mesially or distally from the center of the labial surface. D escription of holotype: NMMNH P-34378 is an elongate, low tooth with a sharp occlusal crest and a prominent principal cusp with a pair of weak lateral cusps immedi ately next to the principal cusp and an additional pair further mesially and distally. There are two pronounced labial pegs, one nearly in the center of the tooth and the other slightly offset. The pegs are broadest at the center of the tooth. No roots are preserved, but the crown-root base is, indicating that the roots were substantially shorter than the crowns. Description of referred specimens: NMMNH P-34379 is nearly identical to NMMNH P-34378 except that it is slightly smaller, the lateral cusps are less distinct, and the labial pegs are arranged more symmetrically . NMMNH P-26428 consists of three fragmentary teeth, all of which preserve the remnants of two labial pegs and thus can be assigned with confidence to D. murryi. Discussion: Murry from localities through out the areal and stratigraphic distribution of the Chinle Group, but never described teeth of Lissodus that bore two labial pegs. Similarly, when Duffin revised the genus These teeth are also distinct from many marine Triassic sharks that possess some form of labial peg, primarily in the presence of the second labial peg and in lacking significant surface ornamentation. Thus the simple, essentially smooth crowns of Diplolissodus murryi are readily distinguished from the complexly ornamented marine taxa Polyacrodus contrarius and Synechodus multinodosus . These are not likely to represent pathological or otherwise deformed teeth of L. humblei. Johnson reported that significantly less than 1% of chondrichthyan teeth recovered from taphonomically similar deposits in the Permian of Texas and Oklahoma were deformed, indicating that it is highly unlikely that Diplolissodus murryi represents a 143 deformed or pathologic morph of L. humblei. In spite of extensive collections, Murry never recovered teeth of this morphology, yet at least five occur at NMMNH locality 1430. These five teeth are fully half of the Lissodus or Lissodus-like teeth known from this locality. Because these five teeth greatly exceed the expected percentage of deformed or pathological teeth Johnson The upper Kalgary locality yields many rhomboid ganoid redfieldiid scales , some examples of which are illustrated in Figure 5 .6A-B. A bone fragment with enameloid embedded on the external surface is probably a redfieldiid dermal bone, although it could represent another palaeonisciform . Palaeoniscidae indet. aff. Turseodus Palaeoniscids at NMMNH locality 1430 are represented by dozens of isolated scales and scale fragments, one of which is illustrated in Figure 5 .6C. These are typically corrugate, with a complex network of anastomosing ridges on the lateral surface. In the past most workers have assigned such scales to aff. Turseodus, although Murry , most of which bear a hooked posterior process and a faint concentric pattern in lateral view, closely resemble semionotid fish scales illustrated by Kaye and Padian . However, Olsen et al. , McCune et al. , McCune and Thomson and Huber et al. 144 FIGURE 5.6: Osteichthyans from NMMNH locality 1430.

Thus, between the fragmentary nature of the fossils and the lack of known Camian semionotids, I conservatively con sider these scales indeterminate probable semionotids. Several toothplate fragments confirm the presence of colobodontids at the upper Kalgary locality. Representative specimens bear teeth that range from elongate to low and blunt . Actinopterygian teeth are best represented by dozens of teeth with moderately low to moderately tall crowns atop long, faintly striated, columnar roots catalogued as NMMNH P-26375 . The crowns are exceptionally smooth and translucent in normal light. The roots are not vertical but do have steeper sides than the crowns . NMMNH P-26350 consists of three moderately low, conical tooth crowns that are simi larly circular basally but slightly laterally compressed apically . Five other teeth that are broadly similar except that they are moderately low to low, conical to backswept, and enamel-less preserve prominent basal striations . Many actinopterygian specimens from NMMNH locality 1430 consist of toothbearing bone fragments. A few of the more complete of these are briefly described here. NMMNH P-26345 is a bone fragment bearing three incomplete teeth. The teeth appear thecodont, but the exposed portion of one root is longitudinally striated as in actinopterygians . Only one crown is reasonably well preserved. This tooth is conical and blunt. The opposing side of the bone fragment is flat, so the jaw itself is very thin. This is probably a palatal fragment. NMMNH P-34364 is a conical, sharply pointed, laterally compressed tooth in a thin remnant of jaw fragment. NMMNH P-34365 is a larger bone fragment with several actinopterygian teeth embedded in matrix. NMMNH P-34366 is a jaw fragment, probably of a palatal element, with one relatively complete and two broken teeth. The complete crown is moderately tall and weakly recurved with prominent longitudinal striations at the base, the other two crowns appear moderately low and conical.

Arganodus dorotheae The only lungfish fossil from the upper Kalgary locality is a badly pitted, incomplete dipnoan toothplate . Strictly speaking, this specimen is too worn and broken to be diagnostic. During the late Camian, however, all known Chinle lungfish pertain to Arganodus dorotheae , and no aspect of this specimen definitively precludes assignment to Arganodus, so I assign it to aff. Arganodus dorotheae. The specimen is very heavily and irregularly pitted, almost certainly a sign of digestive chemical attack, probably by a noncrocodylomorph . Osteichthyes indet. Some microvertebrate fossils from NMMNH locality 1430 clearly pertain to bony fish but are otherwise indeterminate. One of these fossils is a heavily pitted notochordal centrum that is wider than tall, and taller than long, with a flattened dorsal surface . This centrum is very similar to MNA V3595 from the Placerias quarry, illustrated by Kaye and Padian and a specimen from NMMNH locality 2739 discussed later. An incomplete notochordal centrum is longer than wide, probably wider than tall. The centrum appears open dorsally but is also broken and heavily pitted/digested. This centrum appears similar to MNA V3593, illustrated by Kaye and Padian but is considerably larger. Temnospondyli indet. Six labyrinthodont teeth are generally recurved; all are circular in cross-section and range from moderately low to tall . One strongly recurved tooth of NMMNH P-26349 is tall , the other is short, but both are circular in cross-section. All of these specimens are probably temnospondyl teeth, as they are labyrinthodont. Reptilia indet. Many micro-and macrovertebrate fossils from NMMNH locality 1430 are clearly reptilian but otherwise indeterminate. Several o f the more unique morphologies are described and illustrated in some detail below, and the rest are listed in the appendices. A cervical or dorsal centrum bears one expanded coelous facet and one narrow, more platyan facet. The neural canal is wide and the ventral surface of the centrum bears a deep groove that, near the narrow facet, lies between two strong keels. Two tall, recurved, laterally compressed teeth lack serrations. Their external surfaces are heavily pitted and grooved, suggesting that these teeth were 148 heavily worn by either mastication; transport and deposition; or digestion, presumably by another animal. The grooves and ridges are roughly aligned. These super ficially resemble dermal ossifications or possibly claws or scales, but one bears a resorbtion pit. Indeterminate reptilian enamel-less teeth indicate that at least some reptilians were prey items . Enamel-less teeth I recognize as indeterminate reptilians include: NMMNH P-26336, moderately tall, recurved, laterally compressed teeth; NMMNH P-26337, numerous teeth, principally conical and moderately low to moder ately tall, but some backswept and others slightly recurved, some possess remnant serra tions in the dentine . Procolophonidae indet. There are two distinct procolophonid teeth from the upper Kalgary locality, Here I describe each in turn before making detailed comparisons to known procolophonid taxa. The first tooth is a low, ovate, transversely broadened tooth that tapers upward to a worn occlusal surface . In occlusal view there is a labial cusp that is round and slightly broader than the rest of the tooth. This cusp is now worn and bifurcated by a crack. Lingual to the cusp is a pronounced basin flanked lingually by another small cuspule. The most prominent feature of the occlusal sur faces is a transverse wear facet where dentine is clearly visible between the enamel. NMMNH P-26442 consists of two pieces of a single posterior procolophonid tooth . As in NMMNH P-26418, the crown is low and transversely expanded, with a prominent hollow developed just lingual to the labial cusp. The tooth crown is relatively more expanded, and the tooth itself is larger, than NMMNH P-26418 is. The crown bears longitudinal striations or fluting, similar to that described for Gomphiosauridion and differing from most other Upper Triassic procolophonids, includ ing the well-known Hypsognathus . However, this tooth lacks the second fossette Sues and Olsen considered diagnostic of Gomphiosauridion, although it should be mentioned that the holotype of Gomphiosauridion possesses only two teeth, and thus we know essentially nothing about tooth variation in the taxon. The morphology of these teeth well matches posterior teeth of procolophonids as exemplified by Hypsognathus fenneri . Specifically, the deep basin or hollow between two low but robust cusps is characteristic of procolophonid posterior teeth. As described, this is a right lower tooth-in Hypsognathus the hollow/basin is directed posteriorly in lower teeth and anteriorly in upper teeth . The presence of only two major cusps precludes assignment of either tooth to Chinleogomphodon . A small central cusplet lingual to the hollow in NMMNH P-26418 is both smaller than the central cusp of Chinleogomphodon and not aligned between the 151 other two cusps . Similarly, these teeth are more transversely broad than at least one of the maxillary teeth of the holotype of Gomphiosauridion baileyae Sues and Olsen, and the presence o f only a single basin, as opposed to the deep anterior and posterior fossettes, similarly separates them from Gomphiosauridion. How ever, they share with Gomphiosauridion the presence of marked fluting, a feature which further separates them from other procolophonids, including Libognathus sheddi Small . The apparent procolophonid Chinleogomphius jacobsi bears posterior teeth that are tricuspid and superficially similar to those of Trilophosaurus buettneri. I have examined the holotypes and many referred specimens of both taxa, and am convinced that the two taxa are distinct at more than the specific level; and the holotype of Chinleogomphius exhibits ankylothecodont implantation that is similar to that of procolophonids, and thus may represent a procolophonid, as Sues and Olsen suggested. Both holotypes are in need of redescription, and Chinleogomphius requires revision, a project that is underway but incomplete at this time. As enumerated by Murry , the principal differences between teeth of Trilophosaurus buettneri and Chinleogomphius are the prominent cingulae, particularly the cingulae anterior and posterior to well-developed basins between the central and marginal cusps, the asymmetric placement o f the central cusp on posterior teeth. Another important difference is that in Chinleogomphius the central cusp is often significantly taller than the marginal cusps. These features also distinguish Chinleogomphius from the probable procolophonid Tricuspisaurus differs from Chinleogomphius and Trilophosaurus in having tricuspid teeth that are constricted antero-distally in the vicinity of the central cusp. There are two well-preserved teeth, and many fragments, of Chinleogomphius at NMMNH locality L1430 . The best preserved of these . Another, less-well preserved tooth, NMMNH P-34151, is a probable procolophonid tooth fragment, but could also be a badly worn incomplete crown of Trilophosaurus. As preserved two low, elongate cusps connect to each other along a rise that tapers to a thin ridge. CYNODONTIA Owen, 1861s Cynodontia incertae sedis Among cynodont specimens too large to pertain to Adelobasileus , NMMNH P-34384 is a tooth crown bearing three cusps . The first cusp is the largest and most apical, with each subsequent cusp decreasing in size and originating lower on the crown. The second cusp is strongly worn. Anteriorly, a small protuberance low on the crown may mark an incipient cusp near the base. The tooth is elongate . The crown is relatively low, although the primary cusp nearly doubles the total crown height. There is no indication of a cingulum, which excludes it from most tritheledontids . The tooth is less recurved than Chiniquodon and is much smaller than that of most therioherpetids . It most closely resembles tricuspate teeth of the dromatheriid Tricuspes sigogneauae Hahn et al., which also lack cingulae . If the anteriormost process is an incipient cusp, then this tooth also resembles Meurthodon, which always has four cusps . Given that this tooth is much older than the late Norian type and referred specimens of Meurthodon , it is not surprising that it exhibits a more primitive morphology. The strongly asymmetric crown distinguishes this tooth from the chiniquodontids Lepagia and Gaumia. The lack of strongly developed crenulations in the enamel distinguishes this tooth from multicusped pterosaurs such as Eudimorphodon . NMMNH P-34388 is a transversely broad tooth with two cusps . The larger of these I interpret as the labial and the smaller as lingual. A thin transverse ridge connects the two crowns. There are deep fossettes anterior and posterior to this ridge. The enamel is worn away on the labial side, but the crown is otherwise complete. There is no indication of cingulae or accessory cusps. Both cusps are worn, the main cusp apically, the smaller apically and down the labial surface. The lack of basal striations or fluting distinguishes this tooth from the procolophonids, although the crown otherwise resembles Gomphiosauridion and 1 mm .____________________________________________________________ Olsen, 1993) . The presence of only two cusps distinguishes this taxon from other multicusped Triassic taxa, including Trilophosaurus and Xenodiphydon . The crown is simpler than that of traversodont cynodonts in lacking additional cusps or cingulae and is less equant than most traversodont postcanines . The tooth is much larger than those of Triassic mammals and lacks the cingulae that distinguish those taxa and tritheledontids . Dromatheridae? indet. Screen washing NMMNH locality 1430 yielded a few derived cynodont teeth, several of which resemble those of morganucodontids and may represent teeth of the primitive mammal Adelobasileus . These teeth possess a mix of primitive and derived characteristics, ranging from a complete lack of cingulae to incipiently divided roots, a feature found only in dromatheriid-grade cynodonts and mammals . One of these teeth is moderately low, worn, polycuspid secto rial tooth crown and attached root . The tooth crown itself is basically conical with a small, conical accessory cusp projecting from the posterior margin. A small irregularity, somewhat lower and on the anterior margin, may represent an incipient anterior cusp. The primary cusp is severely worn, exposing the dentine across a wear facet that is lower on the lingual side than the labial, and posteriorly inclined such that the antero-lingual comer is highest. The shape of the wear facet suggests that this is an upper right postcanine. Additional evidence o f precise occlusion includes a fine vertical groove on the posterior margin of the primary cusp that extends basally to the posterior . Basally, the lowest preserved portions of the root are bifur cated and a groove extends apically, indicating incipient bifurcation of the entire root. Another polycuspid cynodont tooth is low and sectorial, with a small but prominent anterior cusp and a broad posterior accessory cusp. The principal cusp is conical and, like the other cynodont, is wom lower on the lingual side. The anterior cusp projects sharply forward, extending anterior to the base of the crown. The posterior cusp is nearly as broad as the central cusp and is wom in similar, but not as severe, fashion. Little if any of the root is preserved. Mammalia incertae sedis Adelobasileus cromptoni Hunt, 1990 Lucas and Luo provided a detailed description of the holotype skull of Adelobasileus cromptoni and demonstrated that it was the earliest known mammal. Some of the teeth described above as cynodonts may in fact pertain to Adelobasileus. DIAPSIDA Osborn, 1903 LEPIDOSAUROMORPHA Benton, 1983 LEPIDOSAURIA Haeckel, 1866 Lepidosauria indet. Most lepidosaur fossils from the upper locality pertain to sphenodontians, but one, NMMNH P-26420, is more ambiguous. This upper jaw fragment bears three broken teeth, all of which are moderately low to moderately tall, conical, circular in cross-section and blunt or wom with smooth enamel . The jaw fragment is covered in matrix but appears dorso-ventrally thin. Tooth implantation appears pleurodont, with shallow roots. The jaw is textured with a few faint, elongate grooves and ridges visible in lateral view . Pleurodont dentitions are usually attributed to lepidosauromorphs, especially squamates, but are readily identified in at least part of the dentition of the sphenodontians Gephyrosaurus and Diphydontosaurus . Although this speci men is similar to some specimens of Diphydontosaurus, I refer it only to the Lepidosauria, in part because it is rather large for a sphenodont, but primarily because it lacks any diagnostic characters of the Sphenodontia . SPHENODONTIA Williston, 1925 aff. Diphydontosaurus NMMNH P-26423 is a jaw fragment with one well-preserved tooth crown and one broken cusp . The labial surface is steep and bears small pits or foramina that occur at two discrete levels . Lingually the fragment is much lower . Above the labial margin the relatively complete tooth crown is moderately low, conical, and blunt. The crown is mesio-distally expanded relative to the base. Both teeth are clearly pleurodont, with their roots resting in a deep grove. Although generally similar to NMMNH P-26420 discussed previously, this fragment is much smaller and more strongly pleurodont. The unomamented, moderately tall, pleurodont tooth also resembles those of Diphydontosaurus but, strictly speaking, lacks apomorphies of that taxon so I assign it to aff. Diphydontosaurus here. Planocephalosaurus Fraser, 1982 Planocephalosaurus lucasi sp. nov. Holotype; NMMNH P-26425, two bone fragments, one bearing two complete teeth, an incomplete, erupted tooth and an erupting replacement tooth and a second fragment bearing two teeth . Referred specimens: Known only from the type specimen. Etymology: After Spencer Lucas, for his tireless efforts expanding our knowledge of Triassic stratigraphy, paleontology, and biostratigraphy. Type locality: NMMNH locality 1430, Crosby County, Texas . Type horizon: Lower Tecovas Formation, Chinle Group . Diagnosis: Sphenodontian distinguished from all other sphenodonts but Planocephalosaurus by the presence of conical to weakly lingually recurved teeth with 8-12 prominent longitudinal striations; distinguished from Planocephalosaurus robinsonae in retaining a dentition that is visibly pleurodont even in plain light. Description of holotype: Two tooth-bearing bone fragments are most similar to Planocephalosaurus . The larger possesses two complete teeth, a root with a broken crown, and another erupting tooth position . The mode of implantation is pleurodont, with the teeth situated in a shallow groove. Above the labial wall the teeth are moderately low, conical, and very slightly laterally compressed. In occlusal view the teeth are curved slightly lingually. The crowns possess longitudinal striations or fluting that extend from near the tip more than halfway to the root. These are best developed on the lingual surface. There are typically 4-6 of 160 FIGURE 5.16: Sphenodontian jaw fragments from NMMNH locality 1430. A-D, indeterminate sphenodont in A, lateral, B, medial, C, occlusal, and D close-up occlusal stereo views; E-G, Planocephalosaurus lucasi n. sp. holotype jaw fragment in E, lingual and F, stereo occlusal views; G, second jaw fragment in stereo occlusal view.

The carinae are aligned antero-posteriorly and are not canted. The lingual portion of the bone is almost non-existent. H ie labial surface possess one longitudinal groove and one or two foramina. This is probably a posterior maxilla fragment bearing \"additional teeth\" sensu Robinson . The second, smaller fragment also bears two complete teeth . The steep labial surface is smooth with a foramen near the base. The lingual surface possesses a marked Meckelian groove. The teeth conform in all details with those of the other frag ment except that they are more conical in labial and lingual views. Discussion: The shape and ornamentation of the tooth crowns is most similar to maxillary and dentary teeth of Planocephalosaurus. Fraser identified Planocephalosaurus as a fully acrodont sphenodontian, but Fraser and Shelton demonstrated that, when x-rayed, the anterior dentition of Planocephalosaurus is actually similar to that of the partially pleurodont Diphydontosaurus. P. lucasi is thus a species of Planocephalosaurus in which the dentition is pleurodont even in normal light, a condition more primitive than that of the fissure-fill species P. robinsonae . Sues et al. reported somewhat similar fossils from the Turkey Branch For mation of the Newark Supergroup. Huber et al. identified this unit as Sanfordian-Conewagian in age. The Newark lepidosaurs, however, differ from the Kalgary specimens in that the sphenodont has fully acrodont teeth in the preserved maxillae and the other Newark lepidosaur lacks ornamentation on its pleurodont dentary teeth aff. Clevosaurus latidens F raser A single dentary fragment, NMMNH P-26412, may represent the enigmatic sphenodontian Clevosaurus latidens Fraser. This bone bears three incomplete acrodont tooth crowns . The teeth are low and conical to backswept, with a near vertical posterior face and gently sloping anterior face. All three teeth are strongly later ally compressed , an unusual condition among sphenodontians. In oc clusal view it is clear, however, that the \"anterior\" face is in fact an occlusal surface that was severely wom during the life cycle of the teeth. Thus, the actual crown morphology is difficult to ascertain, although there may have been some faint longitudi nal striations. The weak carinae are aligned antero-posteriorly. The lingual surface bears a thin but prominent Meckelian groove. The teeth are situated on an elongate ridge which is inset medially and thus similar to that of Diphydontosaurus but the wear pattern is more reminiscent of maxillary teeth of Clevosaurus . The lack of a pronounced lateral deflection of the posterior portion of the tooth normally precludes assignment to derived sphenodontians such as Clevosaurus. However, the closely packed teeth are similar to those of AUP 11192 , referred to C. latidens by Fraser . The tooth wear is also consistent with a propalinal motion as discussed by Robinson and characteristic of C. latidens . Alternate hypotheses include the possibility that these are wom dentary teeth of Planocephalosaurus or some other taxon which has ornamented crowns . Workers have had difficulty viewing isolated teeth of Brachyrhinodon in multiple views, but these crowns, as wom, well match Fraser and Benton's description of dentary teeth of Brachyrhinodon as an \"obtusely conical, elongate crown.", "meta": {"ref_id": "Heckert"}}
{"text": "The PEFO localities for the area I collected are PF122 and PF 134 , not PEFO 121 , which is at least 100 m to the south, although at a similar stratigraphic level. Evanoff did not identify any particular locality as Dying Grounds. Here I refer to the locality where these microvertebrates were collected as Dying Grounds because it is very close, if not the same as, the locality identified as \"Dying Grounds\" by Murry and Long and that is in the literature as yielding micro vertebrates . \"Dying Grounds\" sensu Murry and Long and Murry is more than 100 m north of PEFO locality 121 as plotted by Evanoff . This is one of the few localities in the park where Murry reported microvertebrate tetrapods associated with fish, and the known fauna includes the sharks \"Xenacanthus\" and Lissodus, numerous osteichthyans, the amphibian Buettneria, the archosauromorph Trilophosaurus, the phytosaur Rutiodon, and indetermi nate aetosaurs and rauisuchians. Dying Grounds is stratigraphically high in the Blue Mesa Member of the Petrified Forest Formation, approximately 47 m above the base of the unit and 30 m below the Sonsela Member . The vertebrate faunas of Dying Grounds and Crocodile Hill are the type fauna of the Adaman ian lvf, and are of latest Camian age . Murry and Long published a detailed large-scale stratigraphic section of Murry's Dying Grounds locality . I sampled three horizons, which correspond to his lowest bone-bearing interval , a \"coprolite mudstone\" and his middle bone-bearing interval . The primary fossiliferous horizon is the lowest level, and is an extremely thin medium to light gray, clay-pebble to gravel conglomerate up to 15 cm thick overlain by darker gray, highly smectitic slickensided mudstones. Two thinner sequences of identical lithology overlie this interval. I interpret these strata as an abandoned channel subsequently filled with fine-grained sediments in a reducing environment, such as a poorly circulating oxbow lake . I collected approximately 1000 kg from the 3 horizons. Paleobotanical studies at PEFO include studies of the abundant petrified logs from which the park derives its name , megafossil plants . Megafossil plant localities in the Blue Mesa Member at PEFO yield an assemblage of Ash's Long and Murry. Hunt et al. reported, but have yet to describe, a theropod dinosaur from immediately south of Dying Grounds at a similar stratigraphic horizon. An unusual fossil I collected is a silicified bryozoan . This fossil was doubtless part of a siliceous clast that was reworked from late Paleozoic rocks before it was redeposited in the Chinle system. Similar clasts are common in the Sonsela Member , and this fossil was probably eroded down from that level and incorporated into the collection as float. Chondrichthyes? indet. Many microvertebrates recovered from Dying Grounds are fragmentary and enig matic, and some probably represent chondrichthyans. Among these are several fragmen tary elements may represent selachian spines, including a subconical, lightly pitted bone fragment that is somewhat subtriangular in cross-section . A similar element is relatively shorter and heavily pitted. Superficially this bone resembles some aetosaur scutes but is considerably smaller and much more heavily pitted. A peculiar, button-like denticle represents an unknown chondrichthyan. Superficially this fossil resembles amber in color and its smooth texture, but is much more regular and clearly a vertebrate element. Although it resembles teeth of the acrodontid shark Acrodus, it is too round in sagittal section. I tentatively identify this as a chondrichthyan denticle, although it differs markedly from the unusual denticles of Xenaccinthus . \"Xenacanthus\" Beyrich, 1848 \"Xenacanthus\" moorei Essentailly complete teeth, as well as isolated lateral cusps and broken tooth bases, are very common at Dying Grounds. A typical specimen is a nearly complete tooth lacking the tip of one lateral cusp and the lingual edge of the base. The lateral cups are essentially smooth and lack the lateral cutting edges common in other Chinle xenacanths. The medial cusp is also robust and more lingually placed. The crushing surface lingual to the cusps is well developed The basal foramina in the PEFO specimens are radially distributed around the lingual tip of the basal tubercle, with the largest foramen halfway between the lingual margin and the prominent basal tubercle . Incomplete teeth typically have smooth labial cusps but a few teeth do still possess prominent ridges. This difference is probably not of taxonomic significance. Clearly the collection from PEFO should eventually yield impor tant data on variation in \"X.\" moorei. Hybodontoidea indet. Hybodont sharks at Dying Grounds are represented by a wide variety of cephalic and fin spines. A typical example is a broken hybodont spine or denticle base that is sub-rhombic in dorso-lateral view, with numerous striations radiating from the base . This well matches cephalic spines of male hybodont sharks as described by Maisey and Duffin . Another hybodontoid fossil consists of three deeply grooved, later ally compressed bone fragments, some of which preserve the remnants of broken den ticles on their posterior margin. These are probably dorsal fin spine fragments of hybodont sharks . Osteichthyes indet. Indeterminate osteichthyans include several fragments of pitted scales, one of which is illustrated here . Irregular pitting is often attributed to expo sure to digestive acids, and many scales and scale fragments from Dying Grounds also lack enameloid . Fisher did not specifically discuss this phe nomenon in his study of enamel-less teeth, but a logical extension of his work is that the same digestive processes that remove enamel from teeth would strip enameloid from fish scales. Therefore I consider these scales direct evidence of piscivorous behavior, prob ably by archosaurs, at Dying Grounds. Other osteichthyans are listed in the Appendix. Redfieldiidae indet. Rhomboid scales with peg-and-socket articulations represent redfieldiids at Dying Grounds. Murry identified such scales from Upper Triassic deposits in Texas as pertaining to the Lasalichthyes/Synorichthyes complex. Other redfieldiid scales bear an external texture of fine pits and grooves . Another possible redfieldiid fossil is a scale fragment with complex articulations anteriorly and a bulbous body with rounded posterior margin . A process or eminence projects from the internal layer, which is deeply pitted in internal 230 view. This is probably a specialized redfieldiid scale that articulates with the skull bones . Palaeoniscidae indet. Palaeoniscid scales from Dying Grounds are generally rhomboid, very slightly longer than tall, and possess a concentric pattern of fine grooves . These scales are laterally compressed . They conform to scales of palaeoniscid fish, but differ from those of Turseodus in lacking a pattern of anastomosing ridges . Some appear to possess a slight process projecting from one of the comers. A similar fragment consists of a large scale with concentric ornamentation and a prominent anterior process. This could be a skull bone, but is more likely a scale adjoining the skull. Colobodontidae indet. Colobodontid tooth plate fragments are relatively common at Dying Grounds. Particularly diagnostic colobodontid specimens include PEFO 20346, a tooth plate fragment with numerous small, conical, striated teeth , and PEFO 20347, a marginal tooth plate fragment that bears four transversely broadened teeth along the labial margin . Numerous more typical conical teeth are broken off lingually. The transversely broadened teeth are complex and consist of two prominent cusps connected by a sinuous ridge. Some of the more complex folds in these teeth apparently represent cingulae. Metoposauridae indet. Macrovertebrate fossils of temnospondyl amphibians litter the surface o f Dying Grounds, and include diagnostic fossils of Buettneria perfecta and Apachesaurus gregorii . Microvertebrate fossils of temnospondyls are comparatively rare. One such fossil, PEFO 20351, is a tooth-bearing bone fragment with numerous elongate striations on the surface opposite the teeth . The teeth themselves are in two marginal rows, labial to a shelf of bone. No more than two of the teeth are reasonably well-preserved. Each of these labyrinthodont teeth possesses moder ately low, conical crowns and 5-7 longitudinal striations extending from the apex to the base. The individual teeth are no more than 1 mm tall and therefore resemble colobodontid teeth, but the texture of the bone fragment strongly resembles that of metoposaurid jaws . A tall, conical, labyrinthodont tooth crown with numerous longitudinal striations probably represents a metoposaurid amphibian. This tooth bears unserrated mesial and distal carinae. Neither this tooth nor another are, strictly speaking, diagnostic of metoposaurids. However, the overwhelm ing abundance of metoposaurids relative to other temnospondyls both locally at Dying 232 Grounds and in the Chinle as a whole strongly suggests that these teeth represent metoposaurids. Another indeterminate metoposaurid tooth, PEFO 20353, is moderately low, conical, and somewhat laterally compressed . This tooth is generally similar to PEFO 20352 but shorter and with deeper infolding and fewer longitudinal striations. Identifiable microvertebrate postcranial elements are relatively rare, but a nearly flat bone fragment with a bulbous end bearing a pronounced hollow or socket on one side appears to represent a fragment of a metoposaurid pelvis. I interpret this as the acetabulum of a metoposaurid amphibian , with a broad acetabular portion separated from the rest of the ilium by an elongate process. Reptilia indet? Fossils of indeterminate reptiles are common at Dying Grounds. Most o f these are tall, laterally compressed teeth that lack serrations and are not labyrinthodont, so they are clearly more derived than temnospondyls but cannot be assigned to any less inclusive taxon than Reptilia. A complete list of these specimens is in the Appendix. Enamel-less teeth are common at Dying Grounds. Most are moderately low to moderately tall, backswept to recurved, and laterally compressed . Enamel-less reptilian teeth indicate that at least some reptilians were prey items of predators with digestive systems similar to those of crocodiles , in this case probably of phytosaurs. The presence of enamel-less teeth here is hardly surpris ing given the large volume of coprolites from the site. Another interesting reptile fossil is a worn basioccipital . The condyle is broad and projects slightly ventrally and bears an indentation on both sides. The ventral surface is slanted downward and medially in cross-section, such that the floor of the braincase is an obtuse triangle. No sutures are preserved, and the lateral flanges to the exoccipitals are badly worn. Trilophosaurus Case, 1928 Murry illustrated a single incomplete tooth of Trilophosaurus buettneri from Dying Grounds. Thus far I have not recovered any polycuspate teeth from this locality, but I agree with Murry that this tooth repre sents a fossil of T. buettneri, and not Chinleogomphius jacobsi. ARCHOSAURIFORM ES Gauthier, 1984 As with the other localities, I identify a variety of teeth as Archosauriformes sensu Godefroit and Cuny . Each archosauriform morphotype is described in turn below. Tall, conical to slightly recurved, serrated teeth with longitudinal striations that are very finely serrated represent archosauriform morphotype D teeth at Dying Grounds. The serrations are finer than those of type C or type I phytosaur teeth . These teeth are most similar to morphotype D teeth from NMMNH locality 1312, but differ in bearing longitudinal striations. Morphotype J A moderately low, recurved, bulbous tooth bears weak serrations on the lingually deflected anterior carina. The posterior margin is damaged, and much of the enamel has been stripped away. This tooth is similar to type J teeth identified from NMMNH locality 1312, as is a similar tooth . A tall, recurved tooth bears faint serrations on pronounced carinae . This is similar to a type I phytosaur tooth but also falls within the range of variation of type K teeth identified at NMMNH locality 1312. A very tall, recurved, laterally compressed tooth that is very faintly serrated both anteriorly and posteriorly well matches my earlier descriptions of morphotype L, which also occurs at NMMNH localities 1312 and 1430. These are potentially the teeth of theropods, but could also belong to a variety of other Archosauriformes, including rauisuchians sensu lato. Another tooth is similar but unserrated. Parasuchidae indet. Macrovertebrate fossils of phytosaurs, like metoposaurs, litter the area around Dying Grounds, and previous workers collected many complete skulls . The Dying Grounds microvertebrate material lacks large, generically identifiable phytosaur fossils such as skulls or ilia, but includes dozens, FIGURE 9.6: Indeterminate archosauriform and phytosaur teeth from Dying Grounds. A, archosauriform morphotype L tooth in labial view; B, archosauriform morphotype L? tooth in lingual view; C-D, archosauriform type J tooth in C, lateral and D, occlusal views; E, archosauriform type J tooth in lateral view; F-G, type B juvenile phyto saur tooth in F, lateral, and G, occlusal views. All scale bars = 1 mm. possibly hundreds, of phytosaur teeth and other elements, including skull and scute fragments. Phytosaurs from this interval have generally been assigned to various species of Rutiodon tooth with a slightly expanded crown base and 9-10 serrations/mm. With the exception of the slightly swollen crown base, this tooth conforms in all respects to type B phytosaur blade teeth . Its TCH of 2.5 mm indicates that it represents a juvenile phytosaur. Another fossil that may represent a juvenile phytosaur is a regularly pitted skull fragment with a broken medial side but an intact lateral surface indicat ing that the bone bordered a skull opening. This is probably part of a right frontal, with the opening being the right orbit. DINOSAURIA Owen, 1842 Crosbysaurus harrisae Heckert A moderately low, antero-posteriorly long tooth that is laterally compressed and moderately recurved with a slightly concave posterior margin represents the first occurrence of Crosbysaurus from Dying Grounds, and is the oldest omithischian dinosaur in PEFO. The anterior margin bears five prominent denticles, although the edge is damaged apically. The poste rior margin bears at least 10 denticles above the broken margin near the base. All dent icles are inclined approximately 45° to the tooth margin, and are themselves denticled. An unusual omithischian tooth has a vertical anterior margin, a posteriorly hooked tip and steeply inclined posterior margin . The tooth appears laterally compressed, although the lingual surface is broken. The anterior margin bears fine denticles apically . Denticles on the \"hooked\" posterior portion of the tip are slightly coarser above a broken denticle, and the lower posterior denticles are much coarser . These coarse denticles themselves bear 4-5 faint, worn den ticles . This tooth is very similar to UCMP 175161 and MNA V3683 both from the Placerias quarry and described in greater detail later in the chapter on microvertebrate dinosaurs from the Chinle Group. I interpret these teeth as likely premaxillary teeth of Crosbysaurus. As in most basal, heterodont omithischians, the putative premaxillary teeth are taller and more recurved than maxillary/dentary teeth . Furthermore, this tooth morphotype co-occurs with Crosbysaurus teeth at both Dying Grounds and the Placerias quarry. Although it is possible, even likely, that this tooth morphology represents a new taxon, I take the conservative ap proach here and assign teeth like these to Crosbysaurus? sp. A possible omithischian tooth is moderately tall with a damaged labial margin, but may have been asymmetric in occlusal view . The apex is somewhat sharper than the lower margins o f the tooth. The anterior margin bears a few fine denticles , but is largely broken and incomplete. The posterior margin is fully denticled, bearing -10 denticles/mm. All denticles are steeply inclined, approxi mately 60° from the tooth margin. Denticles on the tip are finer but worn and/or less well defined. A low tooth with a bulbous base and a slightly steeper posterior than anterior margin resembles maxillary-dentary teeth of basal omithischians . This tooth is weakly asymmetric, with a modest labial bulge. Both margins bear numer ous fine denticles that are only slightly offset from perpendicular to the tooth margin. The denticles extend around the basal expansion to the base of the preserved tooth crown. By the definitions advocated here, these are omithischian dinosaur teeth. Particularly convincing features are the expanded crown base and the crown asymmetry in occlusal view. The denticles however, are not as well developed as on other omithischians studied here. Certainly PEFO 20339 superficially resembles type B phytosaur teeth, but the denticles, although similar in size, are shaped very differently. These denticles are elon gate tubes that are sharply pointed at apically, rather than the parallel-sided, chisel-tipped denticles typical of phytosaurs. The microvertebrate fauna of Dying Grounds is rich in indeterminate skull and skeletal elements. Many of these are tantalizing but incomplete and not diagnostic pres ently. Several of the more interesting specimens are described here. A flat dermal bone fragment that is broken on three sides bears three compressed, conical processes that project in the same plane as the rest of the element. These processes superficially resemble the bony projections of Upper Triassic procolophonids but more likely represent a fish element. Dying Grounds is also close to the type locality of the enigmatic, heavily armored reptile Acallosuchus rectori Long and Murry , but the microvertebrate specimen described here is not determinate below the level of Vertebrata. Another bone fragment is a well-developed, bulbous condyle that projected posteriorly from a thin sheet of bone that is now broken. The configuration is similar to that of temnospondyl amphibians, which bear two occipital condyles, but could represent a reptile with a very thin basioccipital. A second condyle is transversely broad and attached to a thin sheet o f bone. The bony sheet possesses a symmetrical pattern of very fine pits. This appears to represent a reptilian occipital condyle. Another intriguing element, PEFO 20391, is a wedge-shaped bone fragment that is triangular in outline, and badly pitted. It is probably an intercentrum that was partially digested. This fossil is additional evidence that at least some of the microvertebrate fossils at Dying Grounds represent gut-or fecal contents of the larger members of the fauna. All three horizons I sampled at Dying Grounds included abundant coprolites of varying sizes and, unlike most Chinle microvertebrate localities, Dying Grounds also yields coprolites of microvertebrate size . Hunt et al. were the first to systematically address coprolite taxonomy in the Chinle Group. The coprolites at Dying Grounds are less coiled than either Dicynodontocopros or Heteropolacopros, and lack any evidence of the carbonaceous matter typical of the former. Isolated fish scales and a tooth fragment incorporated in the coprolite masses implicate a carnivorous perpetrator, probably a phytosaur, for at least some of these coprolites. A particularly interesting coprolite fragment was PEFO 20374, which has a partial archosauriform tooth imbedded in it. A portion of the carina and several serrations pro trude from the matrix of the coprolite. This is not a tooth root fragment with a small portion of the crown because it lacks the texture and color of tooth roots and envelops the tooth differently than the tooth-root contact in archosauriform teeth. This coprolite indi cates that some animal ingested an archosauriform tooth, but whether the tooth belongs to a prey item or was shed by the perpetrator of the coprolite is of course impossible to determine. The preserved portion of the tooth resembles other phytosaur teeth from this locality. There are both striking similarities and dramatic difference in the microvertebrate faunas studied here. Some of the more obvious similarities are the relatively uniform chondrichthyan, and even more so, osteichthyan faunas. Typical macrovertebrate tetrapods are nearly ubiquitous as well. Fragmentary dinosaur fossils are surprisingly common, and present at every locality except Ojo Huelos. There are, however, significant differences as well, particularly in the distribution of different tetrapod groups . Not surprisingly, these differences appear to track depositional environment and mode of occurrence, so I compare the taphonomy of the local ities before tackling the diversity and richness of the different faunas. The comparisons made here are principally between the assemblages as a whole. In the summary section of this chapter I break down the occurrence of each taxon in more systematic fashion. I sought to sample diverse depositional environments, and therefore different modes of microvertebrate occurrences. Beyond the probable depositional environments sampled, each of the microvertebrate localities described here has a unique taphonomy. Particularly relevant is the actual mode of accumulation for each. These modes of microvertebrate accumulation are relatively well studied. Essentially, most nonmarine microvertebrate accumulations occur in channel lags and bars, in oxygenated lakes, in karst systems, in pedogenic horizons or lags, or as a result of biogenic processes . The following paragraphs briefly summarize these modes of occurrence, as any interpretation of the context and significance of these localities and their fossils requires a sound inter pretation of their origin. Hydrodynamic concentration of microvertebrates in channel lags and bars is prob ably the most common mode of occurrence for nonmarine Mesozoic terrestrial verte brates . Because many microvertebrate fossils are sand-to pebble-sized, they are readily entrained in aqueous currents. Indeed, most late Mesozoic and early Cenozoic microvertebrate faunas from the North American Western Interior were collected from clay-pebble conglomerates that represent channel deposits . Fossil shape and density may also affect these accumulations. Of the localities described here, 242 the upper Kalgary locality appears to represent this mode of preservation, as sedimentological evidence indicates that those fossils apparently accu mulated on point-bar deposits. Behrensmeyer et al. differentiated channel lags and bars from abandoned channel fills based principally on grain size, characterizing channel deposits overlain by fine-grained sediment as abandoned channel fills. Al though not explicitly stated, abandoned channel fills are also capable of yielding microvertebrate fossils, and I suspect that the lower Kalgary and, to a lesser extent, the Dying Ground locality represent these kinds of depositional environments. Microvertebrate accumulations are known from both clastic and carbonate lacustrine deposits. Generally these deposits occur in oxygenated bodies of water and represent the gradual accumulation of elements from the microfauna inhabiting that body of water and its environs . Clearly, the fossils from the laminar carbonate and fine-grained siliciclastics of the Ojo Huelos locality de scribed here are from this type of deposit. The more finely laminated strata at Dying Grounds also appear lacustrine in nature, and perhaps represent an oxbow lake that postdated the active channel deposits represented by the conglomerates. Many lacustrine microvertebrate assemblages probably contain at least some scatological specimens, also evident at Dying Grounds discussed in more detail below. Karst microvertebrate assemblages include fissure fills, cave deposits, and middens and other biogenic accumulations in karst topography. These accumulations are of little concern here, as none of the localities sampled preserve any evidence of karst processes, although fissure fills in Great Britain have yielded abundant Upper Triassic and Lower Jurassic fossils. These deposits appear to be sequential fills of karst topography, princi pally fissures and sinkholes, developed in Carboniferous rocks . These are the only Upper Triassic microvertebrate fossils known from karst deposits, although the vast majority of these fossils appear to postdate the fossils described here. Scatological accumulation and preservation are most commonly exploited in young deposits. The perpetrators of Holocene scatological accumula tions are typically predatory birds, including owls and diurnal raptors , although coyote fecal material can preserve a similar signature . Andrews and Nesbit Evans studied Recent microvertebrate accumulations perpetrated by viverrid, canid, and mustelid mammalian carnivores. Korth conducted experiments with Recent material preserved in fecal and regurgitated pellets and contrasted those modes of preservation with those of speci-mens that were hydrodynamically sorted. He found that most older Cenozoic micro vertebrate assemblages lacked convincing evidence of scatological origins. More relevant to this project is the study of crocodilian scatology conducted by Fisher . Crocodiles are the most closely related extant taxa to phytosaurs and rauisuchians, the two common larger reptilian carnivores present in the Upper Triassic. Therefore, crocodilian scatology is probably the most analogous to those taxa. Fisher found that crocodilians typically thoroughly digest their prey items, demineralizing hard tissues and eventually defecating \"intact organic matrices of dentine, cementum, and bones\" that do not resemble microvertebrate accumulations. However, the defecated teeth lack enamel and thus are similar to fossil occurrences of \"enamel-less\" teeth . Fisher did not comment on the microstructure of enamel-less teeth, although published studies of microvertebrates digested by non-crocodilians indi cate that tooth enamel is seldom, if ever removed, and is instead pitted and marked with Fissures when exposed to mammalian or avian digestive tracts . Remaining tooth material is then usually irregularly pitted as well. Of the localities studied here, several provide convincing evidence of a possible scatological origin for some of the fossils, principally enamel-less teeth, which occur with varying frequency at all of the localities except Ojo Huelos. Enamel-less teeth are par ticularly common at the Trilophosaurus quarry and the Dying Grounds locality, both of which also yield abundant coprolites. The holotype of Adelobasileus cromptoni was found in a coprolite from the upper Kalgary locality , which also yielded over a hundred coprolites and some, but not nearly as many, enamel-less teeth. Pedogenic carbonates have long been known to have potential for the preservation of vertebrate fossils. Perhaps the most famous examples of these are Lower Jurassic accumulations from the upper Elliot Formation in South Africa. There a narrow stratigraphic interval, the \"Tritylodon Acme Zone,\" consists of a lag of pedogenic carbonate nodules, many of which contain jaws and teeth of the tritylodont cynodont Tritylodon and other fossil vertebrates . Schiebout described numerous similar occurrences from the Upper Cretaceous and lower Tertiary of the U.S. Gulf Coast. None of the localities studied here explicitly fit this mode, although the extensive pedogenic alteration in the strata at NMMNH locality 3764, along with the concreted nature of the bones, may represent an incipient stage of develop ment for this kind of occurrence. Therefore, in terms of Behrensmeyer et al.'s modes of occurrence, the upper Kalgary accumulation is principally a lag deposit. The lower Kalgary and Dying Grounds localities are at least partially abandoned channel fills. Ojo Huelos and the finer strata at Dying Grounds are lacustrine assemblages. The Trilophosaurus quarry was at least partially the result of scatological accumulation, but given the haphazard sample it probably represents a melange of taphonomic modes. Other assemblages with a substantial scatological component include both the upper Kalgary and Dying Grounds localities. Of the remaining faunas, both the Krzyzanowski bonebed and the Sixmile Spring locality are the most difficult to assess. My suspicion is that the Krzyzanowski bonebed is not so much a pure microvertebrate accumulation as a typical floodplain deposit of larger partially articulated tetrapods. These were probably deposited and/or buried by a crevasse splay, and the microvertebrates are just the smaller fossils in the assemblage, not necessarily a typical \"mode\" of microvertebrate accumulation. I do not consider time-averaging to be a significant factor in most of my analyses. Certainly, some localities may represent longer-term accumulations than others, but that should only increase the diversity of taxa known from each locality. This could \"blur\" the distinctions between the faunas of different depositional environments, but in terms of biostratigraphy, correlation, and evolutionary tempo, time-averaging of Chinle microvertebrate faunas is irrelevant. Even if a particular assemblage took thousands of years to accumulate, the time represented is orders of magnitude shorter than the biostratigraphic resolution, which hovers around 4-5 Myr. Any quantitative analysis of diversity and taxic richness in Chinle microvertebrate assemblages is problematic, in large part because of the taphonomic factors introduced previously, but also by the nature of the fossils themselves. Unlike macrovertebrate assemblages, there is no assurance of ascertaining a minimum number of individuals because the most identifiable microvertebrate elements, particularly teeth, do not provide the same constraints as skull and limb bones do in macrovertebrate assemblages. Furthermore, even comparison of identifiable elements is fraught with complications. The few chondrichthyan elements likely to fossilize are all identifiable to a fairly low level, often genus. Osteichthyan scales are also readily identi fiable, but only at the family level. They are also far more plentiful, with several hundred potentially identifiable specimens per individual. Triassic amphibian microvertebrates are seldom identifiable below the level of \"temnospondyl.\" ", "meta": {"ref_id": "Heckert"}}
{"text": "AETOSAURIA Nicholson and Lydekker, 1887 STAGONOLEPIDIIDAE Lydekker, 1887 Aetosaur teeth are exceedingly rare in the deposits studied here. This is probably because aetosaurs have few teeth relative to other archosaurs generally; aetosaur teeth are not particularly distinctive; and aetosaurs apparently occupied more terres trial habitats and are relatively rare in aquatic environments. Indeed, although aetosaur scutes are among the most common Chinle fossils , their skulls are exceedingly rare . All of the aetosaur teeth recovered here are relatively primitive-most are weakly recurved and some bear weak serrations, both primitive features . Rauisuchians sensu lato remain poorly understood, and microvertebrate fossils are inadequate to identify known rauisuchians. Certainly many of the archosauriform morphotypes described here probably pertain to rauisuchians, but many could just as easily belong to theropod dinosaurs. In general, teeth of both are laterally compressed, recurved, and serrated. Rauisuchian teeth often appear less compressed and somewhat shorter but such distinctions are general trends only. Recurved archosauriform teeth, especially tooth morphotypes D and K, may represent rauisuchians, but are not definitive. ORNITHODIRA Benton and Clark, 1988 DINOSAURIA Owen, 1842 In less than twenty years, the fossil record of dinosaurs in the Chinle has leapt from Coelophysis and a few other, more fragmentary theropods to a much richer record. Among macrofossil vertebrates, the theropods are still the most prevalent, but microvertebrate fossils reveal rich records of omithischians and rarer prosauropods, both of which were unknown 20 years ago. The following chapters explore Triassic dinosaur records and evolution in much greater detail than the brief summaries here. To repeat a familiar refrain, there are almost no definitive fossils of microvertebrate theropods, but many fossils that probably represent theropods. In fact, the microvert ebrate record of probable theropods in the lower Chinle Group almost exactly mirrors the macrovertebrate body fossil record -many fragmentary fossils, difficult to evaluate, but apparently recording a diverse and widespread, if uncommon group. Certainly many of the microvertebrate fossils recovered might pertain to thero pods, and such fossils occur at almost every locality, but the records are so fragmentary that little analysis of, for example, theropod diversity is possible. PROSAUROPODA Huene, 1920 The prosauropod fossils identified here, particularly the tooth from the Upper Kalgary locality, are the oldest known from North America, and are only slightly younger than the oldest records worldwide . The upper Kalgary tooth, as well as the more fragmentary and problematic material, thus help to document a worldwide radiation of prosauropod dinosaurs, apparently at small body size, during the Camian and essentially coincident with the appearance of the first dinosaurs. Prosauropod fossils, however, remain exceedingly rare in the Chinle Group, and are the rarest of any microvertebrate dinosaurs. At the outset of this study, demonstrable early Late Triassic omithischian teeth were known from a handful of specimens collected at three or four localities in the Chinle Group. Now, I recognize at least eight omithischian-bearing localities ranging in age from Otischalkian to Adamanian age in the Chinle, as well as several younger, princi pally Revueltian, localities . These teeth have numer-ous biostratigraphic and evolutionary implications. Records of Pekinosaurus and, possi bly, Galtonia in the late Camian portion of both the Chinle and the Newark Supergroup strengthen existing correlations between these strata. The putatively carnivorous omithischian Protecovasaurus is known from two localities, both of Otischalkian age or, in the case of the lower Kalgary locality, possibly earliest Adamanian, age, and thus also ap pears to have some biostratigraphic utility. The occurrence of the new genus Crosbysaurus in no fewer than four localities of Adamanian age indicates that it is a potential index fossil of Adamanian time. From an evolutionary perspective, the diversity and abundance of these teeth indicate that omithischians probably originated during the early Camian and diversified rapidly during the late Camian. One of the more surprising results of this dissertation is the apparent abundance of omithischian dinosaurs relative to theropod dinosaurs. Hunt et al. summarized dinosaurs of the Chinle Group and described dozens of occurrences of theropod body fossils, including several partial skeletons, and recognized over a dozen distinct morphotypes, including multiple herrerasaurs and ceratosaurs. This record was further elaborated by Mexico, which are similarly theropod-dominated. In contrast, the omithischian record was much less diverse, and the only taxon known from more than isolated teeth was Technosaitrus smalli Chatterjee. This study, however, recognizes several diverse om ith ischians, including both previously known taxa and distinctive new morphologies, but theropod remains are relatively undiagnostic. At face value, then, it would appear that omithischian dinosaurs were much more common than previously believed, and that at small body size they may have outnum bered theropods. This discrepancy is probably spurious, however, largely because theropod teeth are relatively plesiomorphic and thus harder to identify as such, and theropods themselves have teeth broadly similar to each other, at least in the Triassic. Therefore, the laterally compressed, serrated, recurved teeth identified here as theropods could also belong to a variety of archosaurs, including groups traditionally identified as rauisuchians, poposaurids, and sphenosuchians. Furthermore, within Theropoda, rela tively few taxa possess distinctive tooth morphologies, and most of these are restricted to the Cretaceous. In sharp contrast to the Triassic theropod record, basal omithischians show a wide range of variation in crown shape and in details of their denticulation. Certainly, it is possible, although I believe unlikely, that some of the named taxa identified here are based on morphological variation within a single species. However, this simply amplifies the point that Triassic omithischians have much more diverse tooth morphologies than most theropods. Consequently, in microvertebrate collections, which are almost always biased towards teeth in terms of identifiable tetrapod elements, omithischians appear relatively more abundant than theropods. This analysis is based on thousands of specimens, now catalogued as some 1360 specific items and literally hundreds of other, more fragmentary elements. Even using the most conservative taxonomy, these fossils represent at least five new species in four new genera and 38 new records of family-or lower-level taxa, all distributed across the seven localities studied here. Chinle microvertebrate assemblages formed principally by sedimentological pro cesses, but there is a substantial scatological signal at several localities, including the Trilophosaurus quarry, upper Kalgary, and Dying Grounds localities. Faunal composition tracks depositional environment, but amniotes always constitute a plurality of all but the Ojo Huelos assemblages. Reptiles dominate floodplain and near channel depositional environments. Amphibians seldom exceed 10% of the fauna, osteichthyans typically comprise 10-25% of the fauna, and selachians are uncom mon in most assemblages and comprise only isolated elements in floodplain assemblages. The new records include five selachian, nine osteichthyan, two amphibian, and 22 amniote taxa. The amniote records include new material of proclophonids , cynodonts, sphenodontians, the archosauromorph Trilophosaurus buettneri, diverse archosauriform reptiles, and dinosaurs. Procolophonid records indicate that this group occurs in the Chinle Group at a much higher level o f diversity than previ ously thought. Cynodont teeth, while present, are incredibly rare but include fossils of both dromatheriids and tritheledontids. There are no fewer than 20 distinct archosauriform tooth morphotypes. O f these, some probably represent rauisuchians, theropods, or other taxa previously known from the Chinle, but others are probably new taxa that have not been identified previously. Unfortunately, most of these teeth are too plesiomorphic to justify more specific taxonomic assignments. Records of Triassic dinosaurs, principally omithischians, greatly improve our understanding of the early evolution of the group, explored in more detail in later chapters. The wealth of new records demonstrates the value of screenwashing Upper Triassic strata. Future advances will require use of this method in Gondwanan assemblages and a concerted effort to match isolated elements to more complete material. One of the principal aims of this project was to understand the origin and early evolution of dinosaurs, so I attempted to improve the fossil record of dinosaurs by screenwashing for them in the localities surveyed here. However, dinosaurs, principally omithischians, were already known from a number of other localities across the Chinle Group at the outset of this thesis These localities are principally Adamanian or Revueltian in age, and are spread across Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona . In this section I review all of these occur rences and others not previously documented in the literature, highlighting microverte brate dinosaurs from the Chinle Group in New Mexico and Arizona. Arizona occurrences include the Placerias quarry and the teeth described briefly by Kirby Each of these localities preserves at least one microvertebrate dinosaur taxon, principally omithischians. The Placerias quarry yields fossils of Tecovasaurus and Crosbysaurus. The Lamy locality includes teeth of Pekinosaurus olseni and the new species, Revueltosaurus hunti, described in the following chapter. This is also the only dinosaur presently known from the Blue Hills. Kirby . Stratigraphically, the Placerias quarry is low in the Bluewater Creek Formation . The fossiliferous localities in the Blue Hills are in the uppermost Bluewater Creek Formation and the lowermost Blue Mesa Member of the Petrified Forest Formation \"meal pots\" localities, are stratigraph ically equivalent to NMMNH locality 3764. Both localities yield a rich vertebrate fauna that includes numerous Adamanian index fossils and are thus of Adamanian age. NMMNH locality 1171, discovered by Phil Bircheff, is in the Los Esteros Member of the Santa Rosa Formation. The Los Esteros Member is the middle of the three mem bers of the Santa Rosa Formation but is still low in the Chinle Group but well below the Black Forest Bed of Ash . This is part of the younger fauna at the Petrified Forest National Park, which includes abundant fossils of the phytosaur Pseudopalatus and the aetosaur Typothorax, both of which are index taxa of the Revueltian Ivf . Therefore, the fauna o f Dinosaur Hill is clearly Revueltian in age. The Owl Rock Formation overlies the Petrified Forest Formation, yet still yields Revueltian index fossils, principally Typothorax and Pseudopalatus, and is thus still of Revueltian age . The type locality of Revueltosaurus callenderi is low in the Bull Canyon Formation and yields part of the type assemblage of the Revueltian Ivf . The type of Lucianosaurus wildi is stratigraphically higher in the Bull Canyon Formation, but is also Revueltian based on occurrences of Typothorax coccinarum . Hunt also reported isolated microvertebrate omithischian teeth from other localities in this area. To the extent that these are identifiable, they pertain to Revueltosaurus callenderi . The Post quarry is low in the Bull Canyon Formation, and yields a tetrapod fauna that includes Typothorax coccinarum and is clearly of Revueltian age . Camp and Welles consid ered the primary bone-bearing interval to represent a bog, pond, or marsh. Jacobs and Murry , Tannenbaum and Kaye and Padian focused primarily on the microvertebrates, which were derived from throughout a nearly 2-m-thick bone-bearing interval, the richest portions of which were sandy stringers indicating higher-energy deposition. Fiorillo and Padian stated that there was a complex interplay of factors involved, and noted the presence of paleosols in the quarry. Lucas et al. focused primarily on the stratigraphy of the area, but as part of that study Lucas and I identified dark, carbon-rich shales bearing conchostracans within 50 m of the quarry laterally , indicating the presence of ponds near the bone layer. Fiorillo et al. considered the principal bonebed the result of drought-induced mortality on a seasonally wet floodplain. Thus, the consensus opinion is that the fauna of the Placerias quarry was collected from a melange of depositional environments. In the context of the other localities I studied, the microvertebrates from the Placerias quarry were probably collected from proximal floodplain deposits. The fossiliferous, sandy stringers are probably crevasse splays. It is impossible to associate Camp's collections from the Blue Hills with specific depositional environments, as there are only two identified localities to cover several square miles of fossiliferous outcrops . In general, most of the smaller fossils appear to come from the Blue Mesa Member, which is dominated by floodplain deposits, many of which are pedogenically modified. There is no evidence that the teeth examined here were ever as heavily concreted as most fossils from NMMNH locality 3764, so it seems likely that the were deposited in more proximal floodplain deposits that were never exposed to as much pedogenesis. Hunt and Lucas briefly described the fauna of the Los Esteros Member of the Santa Rosa Formation, providing an abbreviated faunal list for NMMNH locality 1171 . The Los Esteros Member is a mudstone-dominated unit that consists primarily of floodplain deposits , a partial sphenosuchian , abundant metoposaurids of the genus Apachesaurus, including skulls and skeletons , and the isolated teeth of Revueltosaurus reported by Padian . The tooth-bearing horizon is a bentonitic red mudstone with numerous light green reduction spots, probably a floodplain deposit that underwent some pedogenic modification, but not enough to generate concretions on the bones and teeth. Most of the Owl Rock Formation specimens came from two localities, MNA locali ties 360 and 791, in the upper third of the formation. Kirby interpreted these as floodplain deposits, with locality 360 distal to locality 791. MNA locality 360 is the \"Billingsley bonebed,\" and appears to represent a death assemblage, including several phytosaurs, metoposaurs, and diverse other tetrapods, preserved in a floodplain environ ment . Microvertebrate dinosaurs from NMMNH locality 1171 include teeth of Pekinosaurus, aff. Galtonia, the new species Revueltosaurus hunti and indeterminate omithischians, some of which may represent a new taxon. All but Revueltosaurus hunti are described here. Pekinosaurus H unt and Pekinosaurus olseni H unt and The best tooth of Pekinosaurus from the Chinle Group comes from NMMNH locality 1171. This tooth is a low, conical, slightly asymmetrical tooth with a broken basal lingual surface and oblique to the tooth margin. The crown is very strongly expanded just above the base. The labial surface bears a prominent ridge extending basally from the apex. Particularly diagnostic features of this tooth are its low profile and strongly expanded base as well as the fine denticles. Discussion: Prior to this study, Pekinosaurus was known only from the type locality in the Pekin Formation of North Carolina, an occurrence of Otischalkian age . The Lamy tooth is the most convincing specimen of the genus from the Chinle Group, although I tentatively identified similar fossils from the Kalgary localities. This tooth is almost exactly the same size as the holotype and referred teeth illustrated by Hunt and Lucas . Description: A moderately low, recurved tooth that is asymmetric in occlusal view may represent the first occurrence of Galtonia outside of the type area in the Adamanian New Oxford Formation of Pennsylvania. The tooth has an expanded base and relatively coarse denticles that are oblique to the tooth margin. The anterior margin is convex and the posterior margin straight. Discussion: Presently the AMNH is unable to locate the holotype of Galtonia, so comparison is restricted to original figures by Huene and Hunt and Lucas . Points of detailed similarity include the gross morphol ogy of the tooth, which is weakly recurved and bulbous. The Lamy tooth is slightly smaller than the holotype tooth, which also has a slightly inclined, not straight, posterior margin. Both teeth have carinae that are deflected slightly Iingually, similar to, but not as extreme, as the condition in archosauriform morphotype J teeth. The Lamy tooth lacks the strong triangular bulge in lingual view seen in the holotype and referred teeth of Galtonia . The only other omithischian it at all resembles is Protecovasaurus but it is much more asymmetrical in occlusal view. O rnithischia indet. Another omithischian tooth is moderately low, spatulate, and slightly asymmetric in occlusal view . The denticles are relatively fine for an omithischian but oblique to the tooth margin. The base of the tooth is strongly expanded. This tooth is proportionately much lower and more asymmetric than prosauropod teeth, so it probably represents an omithischian. Because it has a low and somewhat triangular profile, with the \"spatula\" having sharply angled anterior and poste rior edges, I suspect that this is a maxillary-dentary tooth of an omithischian. The lower and broader teeth in the hypodigm of Pekinosaurus olseni are very different, so this may represent a maxillary-dentary tooth of Galtonia. It is distinct from the new species R. hunti and may represent a fourth taxon. A very similar tooth from the upper Kalgary fauna possesses graduated denticles and was thus assigned to aff. Crosbysaurus harrisae. Kaye and Padian illustrated and briefly described several omithischian teeth from the Placerias quarry and noted similarities to teeth of Revueltosaurus. I re-exam ined this collection and redescribe these specimens here, along with an omithischian dinosaur tooth from the UCMP collection. Tecovasaurus Hunt and Lucas, 1994 aff, Tecovasaurus sp. Kaye and Padian identified MNA specimen V3697 as a possible tooth of Revueltosaurus, and Hunt and Lucas , based on Kaye and Padian's illustra tion, referred the same tooth to Tecovasaurus murryi. MNA V3697 actually includes five teeth. Of these, the largest is almost certainly a type I phytosaur tooth. Another is a tall, recurved, posteriorly serrated, laterally compressed tooth of a carnivorous archosauriform. A large fragment is a possible omithischian. Finally, there are two omi thischian dinosaur teeth. I am not convinced that either is the tooth illustrated by Kaye and Padian, . Omithischian dinosaur teeth of MNA V3697 are moder ately low to low, recurved, and weakly asymmetric in occlusal view. Only one of the remaining teeth shows the extreme difference in denticle counts present in the type series of Tecovasaurus, although the illustrated specimen does look very similar to the holotype. Therefore, I am more conservative than Hunt and Lucas and Heckert and Lucas , who assigned these teeth to Tecovasaurus murryi. Although these teeth are similar to Tecovasaurus, there are significant differences, and the presence of complexly denticled teeth at the Placerias quarry indicates that some or all omithis chians may in fact pertain to Crosbysaurus . Description: A single tooth, UCMP V I75161, from the Placerias quarry appears to represent a premaxillary tooth of Crosbysaurus . This moderately tall, slightly asymmetrical, weakly recurved tooth bears complex denticles, particularly on the posterior margin. These complex denticles consist of several sub-denticles, most on the outer surface of the larger denticle, but sometimes on the inner margin. Anteriorly the denticles are finer than their posterior counterparts, and extend only slightly more than one-third of the way down the anterior margin. Posteriorly the basal five denticles each bear multiple sub-denticles, including a sub-denticle on the anterior surface. Discussion: This tooth closely resembles the probable premaxillary tooth of Crosbysaurus described earlier from Dying Grounds , and is also similar to a tooth referred to aff. Crosbysaurus from the upper Kalgary locality . In the taxonomy I advocate here, I reserve Crosbysaurus for all complexly denticled omithischian teeth. If later, associated material demonstrates that proportionately lower teeth like the holotype of Crosbysaurus harrisae belong to a different taxon than the taller teeth illustrated here, then another complexly denticled omithischian genus should be erected. Whatever taxon this morphotype repre sents, it clearly has biostratigraphic utility, as it occurs in three Adamanian faunas. Kaye and Padian identified and illustrated similar teeth , noting similarities to Revueltosaurus and to prosauropods. Of the eight teeth assigned to MNA V3690, only four closely resemble the morphology illustrated by Kaye and Padian . These are similar in overall shape, and many possess complex den ticles, primarily on the posterior margin, so I assign them to aff. Crosbysaurus as well. Lucianosaurus H unt and Lucas, 1994 Lucianosaurus wildi H u n t and Description: Here I re-illustrate the holotype tooth of Lucianosaurus wildi . Using the terminology I favor, this tooth is conical, low, and only slightly asymmetric, principally due to a weak bulge on the labial surface. The conical outline is broken posteriorly by the posterior cusp that distinguishes the genus from other omithischians and is particularly evident in the illustrations here. Both the anterior and posterior margins bear denticles oblique to the tooth margin. These denticles are coarser than those of most microvertebrate omithischians, but finer than those of Revueltosaurus. Discussion: The monotypic genus Lucianosaurus is readily distinguished from all omithischians except Technosaurus by the presence of a prominent posterior cusp, and from Technosaurus by the absence of a similar, anterior cusp . As in many primitive omithischian dinosaurs, the tooth is essentially laterally compressed, and only slightly asymmetrical because of a weak labial bulge. Because the tooth is very low I consider it more likely that Lucianosaurus is an omithischian than a prosauropod, although the latter are superficially similar in being laterally compressed. I consider the tooth referred to the genus by Hunt and Lucas , NMMNH P -18196, which lacks a cusp, an indeterminate omithischian. Because both Technosaurus and Lucianosaurus are Revueltian and known from very fragmentary fossils, future discover ies may reveal that the two genera in fact represent the same taxon, with the differences in cusp number a result of positional variation in the dentition. TH E WARD TERRA CE DINOSAURS Kirby tentatively referred several teeth from the Owl Rock Formation to the Dinosauria, but was uncertain whether they pertained to omithischians or prosauropods. Several of the teeth in question are indeed enigmatic and possess a frustrating mixture of prosauropod and omithischian characteristics. A few of these more closely resemble thecodontosaurid-grade prosauropods than known omithischians, so I describe them here as probable prosauropods. Prosauropoda? indet. One of the probable prosauropod teeth, MNA V7242, is an incomplete, moderately low, conical, laterally compressed tooth bearing denticles that are oblique to the tooth margins . The anterior margin is weakly convex, the posterior margin straight. The denticles are relatively fine , and are coarser basally than apically. A few of the more basal denticles are subdivided, although not nearly as uniformly or to the extent of Crosbysaurus. The compound denticles of V7242 are instead cleft or bifur cated. Neither margin is intact basally, but the arcuate base might be the apex of the resorbtion pit. The fact that this tooth is laterally compressed and relatively finely denticled suggests that it pertains to a prosauropod. However, it is at the low end of the expected height range for prosauropods , and its general resemblance in other features to probable omithischians from the same locality is problematic. The other most likely prosauropod from Ward's Terrace, MNA V7243, is a moder ately low, conical, laterally compressed incomplete tooth crown and oblique to the tooth row. There is a prominent ridge on the labial side that is narrow and pronounced apically, becoming broader and propor tionately lower basally. The tooth is probably nearly complete, as the denticles decrease in size and are almost absent at the base. This tooth is laterally compressed and almost certainly pertains to the same taxon as MNA V7244. These two prosauropod teeth are not much more derived than the upper Kalgary prosauropod or, among better-known taxa, Thecodontosaurus. The denticles are fine and relatively numerous . The cleft denticles appear to be unique among prosauropods. The tooth most likely to represent an omithischian dinosaur from the Owl Rock Formation is very low, conical, and laterally compressed . The denticles are simple, relatively coarse and strongly oblique to the tooth margin. This tooth is more strongly compressed than most, but not all, omithischian dinosaurs, but proportionately lower than any prosauropod tooth. Other putative \"dinosaur\" teeth from MNA locality superficially resemble maxillary/ dentary teeth of Revueltosaurus callenderi but bear serrations, not denticles. I interpret these as small type B phytosaur teeth. saurs is far richer than previously thought, and should spur workers to conduct additional microvertebrate studies, both in the Chinle and in coeval strata in order to improve our understanding of early herbivorous dinosaurs. As part of the comparative studies made for the new omithischian taxa described here, I re-examined the type and referred material of Revueltosaurus identified by Hunt . I also examined specimens identified by Padian , Sereno , Hunt and Lucas , Long and Murry and Heckert and Lucas , as well as undescribed fossils at UCMP and teeth found at \"Dinosaur hill\" in PEFO that are now reposited there. In the course of this study I identified a second species of Revuelto saurus, which I describe here. Because of the taxonomic confusion surrounding Revuelto saurus and its validity, establishing the new species requires a revision of the genus. To date, teeth of Revueltosaurus have been identified from several sites in both New Mexico and Arizona . The type locality of Revueltosaurus callenderi is in the Bull Canyon Formation , and other localities in the area yield fossils of R. callenderi . Padian first identified R. callenderi teeth from strata of the Painted Desert Member of the Petrified Forest Formation in PEFO. Long and Murry also identified teeth of \"/?. callenderi\" from the Blue Hills near St. Johns, Arizona. Hunt and Lucas pointed out that this identification was incorrect, and indicated the presence of similar teeth in the Los Esteros Member of the Santa Rosa Formation in central New Mexico. Heckert and Lucas pointed out additional differences between the teeth identified as R. callenderi by Long and Murry and R. callenderi. Heckert et al. briefly considered the Los Esteros specimens. Here I consider the Los Esteros teeth a distinct species of Revueltosaurus, and refer the Blue Hills specimens to that species. Teeth \"possibly referable\" to Revueltosaurus callenderi by Kaye and Padian are not assignable to Revueltosaurus, and instead include teeth of Tecovasaurus , Crosbysaurus , indeterminate omithischians, and non-dinosaurian archosaurs . All fossils of Revueltosaurus are isolated teeth, with the exception of an undescribed skull fragment collected by Hunt . These isolated teeth, however, are typically the only omithischian teeth from the localities in question, and almost certainly represent one taxon, and possibly one individual, at each locality. Hunt or dentary. This reasoning is logical and I believe correct, but the only supporting evi dence is comparison with omithischians for which the dentition is known . Thulbom also noted that, in Fabrosaurus, maxillary teeth wear down with facets lower on the lingual surface, and dentary teeth wear with facets lower on the labial surface. Consequently, I tentatively identify teeth as premaxillary, maxillary, dentary and maxillary/dentary teeth as appropriate, but dispense with the question marks hereafter. Revised diagnosis: Moderately large, primitive omithischian distinguished from all other omithischians by a combination of its size ; numerous small denticles ; denticles proportionately short and often worn to the enamel by precise occlusion; Revueltosaurus also lacks a true cingulum that was involved in mastication; differs from all omithischians except heterodontosaurids by having premaxillary tooth crowns approximately twice as tall as maxillary/ dentary tooth crowns.

These characteristics effectively differentiate R. callenderi from all other Triassic and Early Jurassic omithischians, including the new species Revueltosaurus hunti , Galtonia, Tecovasaurus, Pekinosaurus, Lucianosaurus, Technosaurus, Pisanosaurus, Fabrosaurus, and Heterodontosaurus . The fact that R. callenderi possesses omithischian synapomorphies, particularly the expanded crown base, asymmetry in occlusal view, subtriangular outline in labio-lingual views, and coarse denticles oblique to the tooth margins differentiates it from theropods, sauropodomorphs, and other archosaurs . Descriptions: Hunt , Padian and Hunt and Lucas have all provided detailed descriptions of the type and some referred specimens of R. callenderi. Teeth Long and Murry assigned to R. callenderi are distinct Lucas, 1995b, 1997) and redescribed below as the new species R. hunti. For this study, I mea sured all suitably preserved teeth of R. callenderi in the NMMNH collec tions and examined many under the SEM. I provide three figures and explana tory text that amplifies the diagnoses provided above. Most of the referred specimens described and illustrated here are topotypes. One of the best preserved premaxillary teeth, NMMNH P-33788, is a moderately low, weakly recurved tooth crown that is chipped lingually. The top is worn nearly flat and the denticles on both the anterior and posterior carinae are worn to the dentine . A very similar tooth, NMMNH P-33791, shows even more extensive wear . This tooth is low, and was probably conical to weakly recurved. The carinae are laterally compressed and give the tooth a somewhat spatulate appearance in lingual 287 FIGURE 12.3: Topotype premaxillary teeth of Revueltosaurus callenderi from NMMNH locality 1.

The denticles on the anterior and posterior carinae are similarly worn. Another worn premaxillary tooth is an incom plete, low premaxillary tooth crown that is broken and worn apically, the tip is flat labiolingually but is slightly higher anteriorly than posteriorly. Another premaxillary tooth is a small, moder ately low tooth crown. The tip is worn nearly flat, and the apical denticles are worn to the dentine. Other topotype premaxillary teeth of Revueltosaurus, while not illustrated here, clearly are morphologically similar. These include NMMNH P-33783, a slightly worn premaxillary tooth that is flat apically. NMMNH P-33784 is an incomplete tooth lacking anterior denticles. Posteriorly there are five denticles in the first mm basally but only 15 in the next most apical 5 mm. The tip itself is broken and the most apical denticles are not preserved. NMMNH P-33785 in an incomplete premaxillary tooth with only faint rem nants of the anterior denticles. NMMNH P-33786 is an incomplete premaxillary tooth crown with worn posterior denticles, the labial surface is chipped and broken, but the top is worn flat. NMMNH P-33787 is broken premaxillary tooth with somewhat lingually deflected carinae. NMMNH P-33798 is a relatively laterally compressed premaxillary tooth. Two maxillary/dentary teeth, NMMNH P-33792 and NMMNH P-33796, encapsu late the range of variation in maxillary/dentary teeth in R. callenderi and are illustrated here . Of these, NMMNH P-33792 is low and triangular in Iabio-lingual views, somewhat laterally compressed, and has denticles oriented nearly vertically and extend ing little more than halfway down the tooth crown. The base is slightly expanded. The carinae are essentially straight, with minimal lingual deflection. NMMNH P-33796 is lower and slightly more asymmetric in occlusal view, with denticles extending to near the base of the tooth on carinae that are deflected lingually. The denticles themselves are somewhat finer than in NMMNH P-33792 . The base of the tooth crown is strongly expanded. Discussion: The holo-, para-, and topotype specimens of Revueltosaurus callenderi are the only omithischian dinosaur teeth from the type locality . In addition to their similar morphology, their size indicates that all pertain to a single taxon, and could conceivably have belonged to a single individual. As stated previously, comparison with other omithischian dinosaurs strongly supports the posi tional determinations of Hunt , Hunt and Lucas , and those made here. When I determined that there were two distinct omithischians with moderately large teeth in the Upper Triassic of western North America, I deliberately tried to find the teeth of R. callenderi that were most similar to the teeth of the second taxon. The tooth crowns I described here, especially the topotype premaxillary teeth , are the fossils that most closely resemble the new species R. hunti, and they are still clearly distinct. aff. Revueltosaurus callenderi Several teeth of omithischian dinosaurs in the collections at NMMNH may pertain to R. callenderi but are too incomplete to refer to the species unambiguously. These include several teeth from NMMNH locality 526 in the Bull Canyon Formation of east-central New Mexico. The best preserved of these teeth is similar to the maxillary/dentary teeth of R. callenderi. Another tooth is similar in size to R. callenderi but bears somewhat finer , shorter denticles. Similarly, NMMNH P-17187 from NMMNH locality 498 in the Bull Canyon Formation is an indeterminate omithischian tooth that is similar in size to teeth of Revueltosaurus callenderi.

Etymology: After Adrian Hunt for his extensive and diverse contributions to our understanding of Triassic paleontology, biostratigraphy, and biochronology, particularly with regard to early dinosaurs. lV pe locality: NMMNH locality 1171, Santa Fe County, New Mexico . Type horizon: Los Esteros Member, Santa Rosa Formation, Chinle Group . D istribution: Upper Triassic strata of New Mexico and Arizona. Diagnosis: Species of Revueltosaurus distinguished by having posterior denticles that are slightly coarser and extend farther basally than the anterior denticles; denticles generally coarser ; denticles coarsening basally; pronounced bulge on lingual surface resulting in a lingually concave outline in mesio-distal views; anterior denticles frequently offset lingually near base, occasionally with carinae bifurcat ing, resulting in basal denticles labial and lingual to the split carina; apex of tooth worn oblique to vertical axis of tooth . These characteristics effectively differentiate R. hunti from all other Triassic and Early Jurassic omithischians, including Revueltosaurus callenderi, Galtonia, Tecovasaurus, Pekinosaurus, Lucianosaurus, Technosaurus, Pisanosaurus, Fabrosaurus, and Heterodontosaurus . The fact that R. hunti possesses omithis chian synapomorphies, particularly the expanded crown base, asymmetry in occlusal view, subtriangular outline in Iabio-lingual views, and coarse denticles oblique to the tooth margin differentiate it from theropods and sauropodomorphs . Description of holotype: The holotype tooth is moderately low, recurved, and asymmetric in occlusal view . It is coarsely denticled on both margins, with the posterior denticles extending farther basally. The tip of the tooth and many of the denticles are worn to the dentine. The tip and anterior denticles are especially worn on the lingual side. In mesial or distal view the tooth is concave lingually and convex labially, largely because there is a prominent bulge near the base of the lingual side that may represent an incipient cingulum. Broken enamel over this surface causes it to appear smaller than it actually is. Aside from the denticles the only other ornamentation on the tooth consists o f faint longitudinal grooves on both the labial and lingual surfaces radiating basally from the tip of the tooth. The crown is expanded ba sally, especially anteriorly, where it overhangs the crown-root junction. Description of referred specim ens: The next best preserved tooth in the NMMNH collections from the type locality, NMMNH P-29358, is a nearly complete, moderately low, recurved tooth crown that is strongly asymmetric in occlusal view . The anterior margin is strongly convex and the posterior margin is weakly concave, such that the apex of the tooth is almost posterior to the posterior margin of the root. The tooth bears coarse denticles anteriorly and posteriorly, and the posterior carina extends farther 293 FIGURE 12.6: Paratype teeth o f Revueltosaurus hunti n. sp. from NMMNH locality 1171. A-C, NMMNH P-29358 in A, labial, B, lingual, and C, stereo occlusal views; D-F, NMMNH P-29359 in D, labial, E, lingual and F, stereo occlusal views. All scale bars = 1 mm. basally than the anterior carina, which bifurcates labially and lingually. The lingual portion of the anterior carina is broken medially, but bore at least three denticles that extended posteriorly near the base of the crown. The labial portion of the anterior carina is less prominent and bears three denticles that are smaller than those of the lingual carina. The denticles on the primary carinae are extremely worn and expose the enamel on most denticles. The wear facets are inclined downwards toward the labial face of the tooth, indicating that this is probably a dentary tooth. The lingual carina fades into a prominent bulge on the lingual surface. As in the holotype, a weak ornamentation of longitudinal grooves emanates from the apex of the tooth. The tooth is strongly expanded just above the base. A much less well preserved tooth is an incom plete tooth crown that was probably moderately low and recurved. The tooth is coarsely denticled, with the anterior carina deflected lingually and the posterior carina extending farther basally than the anterior one. The tip is broken, but the preserved denticles are 294 worn, with the dentine exposed on several. Wear facets are inclined down toward the labial surface, indicating that this was a dentary tooth. There are remnants of a prominent bulge near the base of the lingual side. Anteriorly the crown is expanded above the base, the posterior margin is broken. Other paratype specimens of Revueltosaurus hunti include NMMNH P-29347, a broken tooth with posterior denticles lower than anterior denticles, a prominent lingual bulge and an expanded base. The dentine in the denticles is clearly exposed as a result of wear. NMMNH P-29348, is an incomplete tooth that is essentially identical to NMMNH P-29347. NMMNH P-29349 is an incomplete, moderately low, weakly recurved, weakly laterally compressed tooth crown with the anterior denticles deflected lingually. The posterior margin is broken, but the preserved denticles are coarser than their counterparts on the anterior margin. The tip is also broken. The tooth is distinctly concavo-convex in mesio-distal view and has a prominent bulge near the base of the lingual surface. The base of the crown is expanded, especially anteriorly. NMMNH P-29350 is a worn and broken tooth that is recurved with lingually deflected carinae. The base is expanded. NMMNH P-29351 is a possible premaxillary tooth of R. hunti. This moderately low, recurved, laterally compressed to very slightly asymmetric tooth is expanded basally. The carinae are coarsely denticled with posterior denticles extending farther basally than anterior denticles, which are deflected slightly labially, not lingually. The tooth is weakly concavo-convex in anterior or posterior view. Anteriorly there are approximately 5 denticles/3.5 mm, posteriorly there are 7 denticles/4.3 mm. The tip is broken not worn. Apically the denticles are worn down to the lingual side. As in the holotype, this tooth also possesses relatively strong longitudinal grooves emanating from the apex. NMMNH P-29352 is a broken tooth that is moderately low, recurved, and strongly asymmetric in occlusal view. Most of the anterior margin is sheared off. The posterior denticles appear relatively coarse and there is a prominent lingual bulge basally. NMMNH P-29353 is a broken tooth crown. Only the anterior denticles are pre served, and these bifurcate basally. NMMNH P-29354 is a worn and broken tooth crown. This tooth is probably moder ately low, but the tip is broken. Both margins are denticled and the preserved denticles are worn. The tooth is weakly asymmetric in occlusal view and would be more so but the lingual bulge is sheared off. The crown is strongly expanded just above the base. Longi tudinal grooves are very strong-essentially crenulations. Both the anterior and, possibly, the posterior margin bifurcate labially and lingually near the base. P. Bircheff collected the following UCMP specimens from UCMP locality V92048, \"Ananosia well.\" ", "meta": {"ref_id": "Heckert"}}
{"text": "Map data, tooth preservation, and color all indicate that this is the same site as NMMNH locality 1171 , so these teeth are topotypes of R. hunti. UCMP V173839 is the basal half of a possible premaxillary tooth of R. hunti. The tooth is broken below the anterior denticles, but the posterior denticles are medially deflected. This tooth is propotionately narrower than the other topotypes, with no anterior expansion of the crown base, although the posterior margin is expanded. Another probable premaxillary tooth, is a nearly complete, moderately low, recurved tooth crown with a broken tip. The base is strongly expanded, and the anterior denticles are slightly finer than the posterior denticles and lingually deflected basally. The posterior denticles extend farther basally than the anterior denticles. The labial bulge is strongly pronounced, and the tooth is concavo-convex in antero-posterior views. Some longitudinal striations or fluting emanating from the apex are evident on the labial surface. Another probable premaxillary tooth, is a nearly complete tooth crown with a broken tip that is probably not worn. The labial margin is strongly convex. There are some longitudinal striations on both sides. The anterior carina appears to bifurcate basally, deflecting both lingually and labially. The posterior carina extends farther basally and also bifurcates. Bulges are apparent both lingually and, to a lesser extent, labially . Many denticles are worn to the dentine, and the wear facets are inclined lingually . The following UCMP specimens were collected by C.L. Camp from the Blue Hills , either high in the Bluewater Creek Formation or low in the Blue Mesa Member of the Petrified Forest Formation. An incomplete tooth crown has anterior denticles slightly smaller than posterior denticles and deflected lingually; this tooth is labially convex with its tip deflected lingually and a prominent lingual bulge near the base. UCMP V I39564 is similar but more worn, somewhat crushed, and bears faint, arcuate, longitudinal striations or fluting and the tip is worn slightly farther labially than lingually. UCMP V I39566 is a broken and worn tooth with both carinae deflected lingually, espe cially the posterior carina. The tip is worn lower on the labial side than the lingual. Another incomplete tooth crown preserves part of the root as well. The tooth is crushed and worn, but was probably moderately low and spatulate originally-teeth such as this are the most likely candidates for maxillary/ dentary teeth in R. hunti. The anterior carina bifurcates distally. This tooth was suppos edly illustrated by Long and Murry but does not resemble that tooth very closely. Angielczyk reports numerous instances where FIGURE 12.7: Topotype teeth of Revueltosaurus hunti n. sp.

All scale bars = 2 mm except for C = 200 microns. the numbers given by Long and Murry for illustrated specimens are incorrect, but I have not been able to determine which tooth was in fact illustrated by Long and Murry . The following brief descriptions illustrate the remarkably uniform morphology of teeth I assign to R. hunti. Because of time, space, and technical constraints, most of these teeth are not illustrated. However, even isolated descriptions such as these falsify the assertions of Charig and Crompton and Sereno that omithischian dinosaur teeth are not diagnostic to genus. UCMP V I39567 is a broken tooth crown with a very strong basal expansion, the posterior denticles extend farther basally than the anterior denticles and are slightly coarser, and the anterior carina is deflected slightly lingually. UCMP V I39568 is an 298 incomplete tooth crown. The tip is worn farther labially than lingually. UCMP V 139569 is a broken tooth crown with the posterior carina extending much farther basally than the anterior carina. UCMP V 139570 is a nearly complete tooth crown and incomplete root. The crown possesses a very strong lingual shelf and anterior denticles that are finer than the posterior denticles and thus do not extend as far basally. The tip is slightly more worn or broken on the lingual side. UCMP V 139571 is a tooth crown that is relatively shorter than the others described here and thus probably represents a more posterior tooth. The anterior carina is deflected slightly anteriorly and the denticles are subequal in size but the posterior denticles do extend farther down the tooth. UCMP V I39574 is a broken tooth tip, illustrated by Long and Murry . The anterior carina is deflected farther lingually than the posterior carina, but does not extend as far basally. UCMP V I39575 is an incomplete tooth crown that is not the specimen illustrated by Long and Murry . Discussion: Teeth of Revueltosaurus hunti are clearly omithischian, as they are expanded basally, asymmetrical in occlusal view, and bear coarse denticles oblique to the tooth margin. I assign these teeth to Revueltosaurus because the denticles are still rela tively fine compared to more derived omithischians of similar size and because the premaxillary and indeed, possibly all teeth, are still weakly recurved. Many details of tooth shape, especially the shape and distribution of the denticles, readily distinguish R. hunti from R. callenderi. In R. hunti, the denticles are finest apically and coarsen basally, whereas R. callenderi has fine denticles both apically and basally, with the coarsest denticles in low on the carinae but above very fine denticles. The posterior denticles in R. hunti coarsen more rapidly than their anterior counterparts, and therefore always extend farther down the posterior margin than the anterior denticles do down the anterior margin. In R. callenderi corresponding anterior and posterior denticles are approximately equal in size and generally extend equally far down the tooth. The carinae in R. hunti sometimes bifurcate basally, they never do in R. callenderi. To the extent that denticle counts are possible, the anterior and posterior carinae of R. hunti bear almost exactly the same number of denticles. Therefore, the greater basal extent of the posterior denticles is a direct result of their somewhat larger size relative to the anterior denticles. Specifically, the denticles increase in size basally more rapidly on the posterior carina than on the anterior carina. Consequently, while the number of den ticles on each side is the same, the posterior denticles always extend farther basally. The wear on denticles of Revueltosaurus teeth is distinct between the two species. In R. hunti, the wear facets are always inclined-down to the labial side on upper teeth and down to the lingual side on lower teeth. In R. callenderi, the denticles are worn equally on their labial and lingual surfaces, and many teeth are essentially worn flat apically. Indeed, if wear facets in R. callenderi are inclined at all, they are inclined down to the posterior side. The two taxa also have significant differences in overall shape. Teeth of R. hunti possess a prominent bulge on the lingual surface basally, giving them a concavo-convex shape in antero-posterior view. Teeth of R. callenderi lack such a bulge, and therefore have more vertical lingual margins in antero-posterior view. To date all teeth of R. hunti are at least slightly recurved, unlike the subtriangular maxillary-dentary teeth of R. callenderi. On all of these teeth the longitudinal striations are somewhat variable, but appear to occur only on the labial side of strongly concavo-convex teeth and on both sides of straighter specimens. No one has attributed taxonomic significance to these features in omithischian teeth previously, nor do I do so here. Although superficially similar to R. callenderi, there is no overlap of the morpho logical details I use to distinguish R. hunti in R. callenderi. Teeth of R. hunti are the same size as those of R. callenderi, so the morphological differences are not ontogenetically related. No indication of substantial sexual dimorphism in dinosaur dentitions has been documented, so sexual variation is highly unlikely. Given that both taxa occur at multiple localities and are each known from 20 or more teeth, the statistical possibility that the two species represent one taxon, with R. callenderi based on teeth from one position in the mouth and R. hunti from others, is extremely small. Because the general size, shape, and overall denticle density of the teeth are similar to each other, I see no reason to erect a new genus for R. hunti. Indeed, if some continue to insist on referring to Revueltosaurus as a \"form genus\" , then I think it informative to keep R. hunti in that same genus, although I follow Hunt and Lucas and consider some Triassic omithischian taxa based on teeth valid taxa and not \"form genera\" because each of these taxa is apomorphy-based and diagnosable from other omithischians. The following specimens match known specimens of R. hunti in at least some characteristics and were found in association with teeth of R. hunti, but are too poorly preserved to assign to R. hunti with certainty. NMMNH P-29355 is a badly worn and broken tooth that appears to have the general shape of the others, especially the promi nent lingual bulge. NMMNH P-29359 is a small, worn, broken crown that is recurved with deflected denticles. UCMP V139565 is a badly eroded, broken tooth with an ex-panded base. UCMP V 139572 matches the other UCMP specimens in general dimen sions, but is broken basally and posteriorly. Both R. callenderi and R. hunti occur at multiple localities in New Mexico and Arizona. Lithostratigraphic and biostratigraphic correlations demonstrate that all occur rences of R. hunti are of Adamanian age, and all occurrences of R. callenderi are Revueltian . Indeed, this is further evidence that the two are discrete taxa, although stratigraphic distribution alone is never a valid criterion for distinguishing species. The type locality of R. hunti is in the Los Esteros Member of the Santa Rosa Forma tion. The Los Esteros fauna includes a few age-diagnostic taxa, including the phytosaurs Angistorhinus and Rutiodon . Together these taxa indicate an earliest Adamanian age, as Rutiodon is an Adamanian index taxon and Angistorhinus is an Otischalkian index taxon whose range extends into the lowermost Adamanian . The other occurrence of R. hunti, in the Blue Hills near St. Johns, Arizona is from the Bluewater Creek Formation or Blue Mesa Member of the Petrified Forest Formation. Here R. hunti co-occurs with the aetosaur Stagonolepis and the phytosaur Rutiodon and is clearly of Adamanian age. Hunt , Padian and Hunt and Lucas established that R. callen deri occurs in the Bull Canyon Formation and the Painted Desert Member of the Petrified Forest Formation. The Bull Canyon Formation records are part of the type Revueltian fauna . The aetosaur Typothorax and the phytosaur Pseudopalatus, index taxa of the Revueltian Ivf, are abundant in the Painted Desert Member as well . Recently Beuhler et al. and Hunt indicated that R. callenderi is limited to the lower portion of the Painted Desert Member and Bull Canyon Formation, and is conspicuously absent higher in the stratigraphic section. While preliminary, this may indicate that the R. callenderi biochron is shorter than the Revueltian and may perhaps represent only an early Revueltian age . Revueltosaurus thus has great utility as an index fossil. Padian and Hunt and Lucas both demonstrated that R. callenderi could be used to correlate Revueltian strata, and Beuhler et al. and Hunt hypothesize that the range of R. callenderi actually subdivides Revueltian time. Similarly, R. hunti can be used to corre late Adamanian strata. Indeed, teeth of Revueltosaurus are potentially among the best index taxa for these faunachrons because they are locally abundant, easily identified, and have a limited stratigraphic range. This could be especially important as workers in the Chinle continue to investigate dinosaur-bearing deposits, which are often paleosols or distal floodplain deposits lacking in the typical aetosaurian and phytosaurian index fossils. A G E o 'c/3 C/3 This chapter demonstrates that teeth historically referred to Revueltosaurus callenderi actually belong to two distinct species of Revueltosaurus. Details of tooth shape, denticulation, and wear all demonstrate differences between R. hunti and R. callenderi. According to most phylogenetic hypotheses , R. hunti may be more derived, as it has a lingual bulge that may represent an incipient cingulum, although I have found no evidence that this portion of the tooth was directly involved in mastication. Both teeth demonstrate precise tooth-to-tooth wear, but the wear facets on each are distinct. Hunt first noted that Triassic dinosaurs were typically only found in distal floodplain or paleosol facies, and Wright et al. noted that all occurrences of R. callenderi are in such facies. Thus it is possible that teeth of dinosaurs such as Revueltosaurus will only become more impor-tant biostratigraphically as workers continue to examine those facies, and microvertebrate faunas in general, for Late Triassic tetrapods. Consequently, R. hunti and R. callenderi have great potential as index fossils of the Adamanian and Revueltian Ivfs, respectively. ht = height measured as the length of the carina, not the tooth crown pmx = premaxillary md = maxillary/dentary *= measurement based on incomplete carina = measurements made exclusive of basal fine denticles All measurements in mm. pmx = premaxillary md = maxillary/dentary 1.4 0.9 UCMP V I39567 pmx 6/5.9 1.0 UCMP V I39568 pmx 6/7.4 0.8 UCMP V I39569 6/5.6 1.1 UCMP V I39570 pmx 6/6.8 0.9 UCMP V I39571 md 6/3.5 1.7 UCMP V 139572 md? 8/4.8** 1.7 4/2.5 1.6 UCMP V I39574 pmx 3/3.4 0.9 7/7.7 0.9 UCMP V I39575 pmx 3/3.6 0.8 UCMP V I73840 pmx? 3/3.1 1.0 8/5.6 1.4 UCMP V173841 pmx? 7/5.5 1.3 7/5.6 1.25 ht = height measured as the length of the carina, not the tooth crown = measured exclusive of deflected denticles * all denticles worn or broken, measurement is of overlap of bases and probably spurious. ** includes several very fine apical denticles pmx = premaxi llary md = maxillary/dentary A central premise of the original proposal for this project was to shed light on the origins and early evolution of major tetrapod clades in the Triassic. The localities sur veyed yielded abundant and diverse dinosaur material, and this has fueled an interest in exploring dinosaur origins and early evolution in greater detail. To fully address these questions, this chapter focuses on the distribution and chronology of Triassic dinosaur occurrences. This then provides the framework for a more wide-ranging discussion of the tempo and modes of dinosaur evolution in the next chapter. Here I document the stratigraphic succession of Triassic dinosaurs worldwide. This record includes body fossils from all modem continents except Antarctica and Australia, and footprints from all continents except Antarctica. At this time, most Triassic dinosaurs appear to be endemic to a single basin, if not a single locality. However, correlations based on other tetrapods-principally phytosaurs, aetosaurs, rhynchosaurs and metoposaurs-allow me to order chronologically the appearance of dinosaur taxa. Be cause most of these taxa are known from relatively few specimens, I cannot discuss actual stratigraphic ranges of most taxa in a quantifiable fashion, but detailed documenta tion of the lithostratigraphic and biostratigraphic superposition of these dinosaurs pro vides important information regarding their early evolution and diversification. For the remainder of this chapter, I discuss dinosaur faunas by region geographi cally. For each region, I address each of three major clades in turn , and in order from the oldest occurrence in a region to the youngest. For each taxon I briefly mention its type occurrence and the material that the type is based upon. Generally, I will describe taxa with complicated or controversial taxonomic histories in more detail, justi fying whatever taxonomic assignment I give them. Additionally, for each taxon or basin I will review the reason for assigning that occurrence to a given land-vertebrate faunachron of Lucas and Hunt . These Ivfs are the same Ivfs I have used throughout this work: Otischalkian ; Adamanian ; Revueltian ; and Apachean . Finally, where these assignments are controversial, I explicate them in greater detail. Theropod body fossils occur in Upper Triassic sediments in North and South America, Greenland, Europe, South Africa and India, with footprints known from North America, Greenland, Europe, and Africa . Theropod or probable theropod body fossils are known from rocks as old as Otischalkian, and are relatively common throughout the rest of the Triassic, although the Coelophysis quarry in northern New Mexico is the only incidence of theropods dominating a Triassic local body fossil record. The ichnogenus Grallator Hitchcock and related ichnotaxa are widely accepted as the footprints of theropod dinosaurs. These trace fossils are rare in pre-Rhaetian rocks, but are locally abundant in uppermost Triassic rocks in the Chinle Group and Newark Super group in North America and in the lower Elliot Group in South Africa. The earliest sauropodomorphs, and indeed all Triassic body fossils of sauropodomorphs save one, are prosauropod dinosaurs, and these oldest prosauropods are also among the oldest known dinosaurs. Upper Triassic sauropodomorph body fossils are known from North and South America, Greenland, Europe, North and South Africa, Madagascar, India, and Thailand . Again, their oldest records are Otis chalkian and, unlike the other two lineages, prosauropods are locally abundant by Revueltian time and dominate several tetrapod faunas by Apachean time. The ichnogenera Tetrasauropas and Pseudotetrasauropus are widely recognized as the tracks of prosauropods, although Lockley et al. recently argued for a sauropod trackmaker in the case of Tetrasauropus. Tracks of one or the other of these ichnogenera occur in Upper Triassic strata in North America, Europe, and South Africa . These records generally occur in strata broadly corresponding to body fossil localities, except in North America, where sauropodomorph ichnofossils greatly outnumber body fossils. As with the theropods, these records are relatively rare low in the Upper Triassic and common in uppermost Triassic rocks. The Triassic omithischians have the most depauperate body fossil record of Triassic dinosaurs and a similarly poor ichnofossil record as well. Triassic omithischians are known largely from teeth, and are restricted to dental and skull/jaw records in North America, Western Europe, North Africa and possibly, India. The incomplete holotype skeleton of Pisanosaums mertii Casamiquela is from South America . Workers long considered Atreipus the footprint of an omithischian dinosaur . but more recent workers have pointed out that there is no convincing reason to assume that all Atreipus trackmakers are omithischians and Haubold and Klein consider Atreipus diagnostic of no more than a dinosauromorph trackmaker. Consequently, the omithischian ichnofossil record is at least as poor as the body fossil record. The dinosaurian fauna of the Upper Triassic of western North America is diverse, well-studied, and most recently summarized by Hunt et al. . The body fossil record includes diverse theropods and fragmentary, yet diverse, omithischians. Prosauropods are rare in the body fossil record. The ichnofossil record consists primarily of tracks of theropods and prosauropods. These records range in age from Otischalkian to Apachean . All Triassic theropod body fossils in North America are derived from the Upper Triassic Chinle Group . To date, numerous theropod fossils have been reported from Triassic sediments in Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona, with isolated specimens known from Wyoming and Utah. The first theropod reported from the Chinle Group was Coelophysis , with other important theropod fossils reported later by Huene , Case . Even after discovery of the Whitaker quarry in 1947 . Hunt et al. reported a single theropod podial from the Popo Agie Formation of Wyoming. Long and Murry reported a proximal femur of the herrerasaurid Chindesaurus from Trilophosaums quarry 3, but I concur with Hunt et al. and consider this specimen an indeter minate theropod of Otischalkian age. The possible theropods from the Trilophosaums quarry discussed previously are from the same stratigraphic level as the material described by Long and Murry . These Texas fossils are part of the type Otischalkian fauna, which includes the index fossils Paleorhinus and the aetosaur Longosuchus meadei . The New Mexican dinosaur co-occurs with fragmentary Longosuchus armor , and the Popo Agie theropod co-occurs with Paleorhinus , the two relatively derived theropods from NMMNH locality 2739 , the theropods from NMMNH locality 3764, a probable theropod of unknown affinities named Spinosuchus caseanus Huene , the herrerasaur Caseosaurus crosbyensis Hunt et al. , and several fragmentary theropods from diverse localities, including many of the microvertebrate localities sur veyed here . This indicates that theropods diversified rapidly after their first appearance . The holotype of Camposaurus arizonensis Hunt et al. consists of a fused ankle from the Placerias quarry in the Bluewater Creek Formation in east-central Arizona. Hunt et al. distinguished Camposaurus from all other ceratosaurs but Coelophysis and Syntarsus by the presence of four fused bones in the ankle, and from those taxa by the presence of a horizontal ventral margin of the astragalus, as opposed to the concave margin of Coelophysis and Syntarsus. Although the holotype certainly represent ceratosaurs, I remain skeptical regarding the validity of the criteria Hunt et al. used to diagnose Camposaurus. Specific areas of concern are the lack of overlap in skeletal elements with other Triassic theropods, including the types of Eucoelophysis baldwini Sullivan and Lucas and Procompsognathus triassicus Huene, and the apparently substantial variation in the ossification of the ankle joint in ceratosaurs . Therefore I consider Camposaurus a ceratosaur incertae sedis, and suspect that future finds will relegate it to the position of a nomen dubium. Indeed, Downs has already stated as much in print, noting that \"Camposaurus appears to fall easily into the range of variation seen in the Ghost Ranch sample of Coelophysis and is thus a nomen dubium.\" ", "meta": {"ref_id": "Heckert"}}
{"text": "The theropods from NMMNH localities 2739 and 3764 were discussed at length earlier in this paper. Here I simply reiterate that locality 2739 is low in the Bluewater Creek Formation, at a stratigraphic position roughly equivalent to the Placerias quarry . NMMNH locality 3764 is low in the Blue Mesa Member of the Petrified Forest Formation, strati graphically well above the Placerias quarry and NMMNH locality 2739, but stratigraphically lower than the Petrified Forest Formation theropod localities of Hunt et al. . The holotype of Caseosaurus crosbyensis, UMMP 8870, is a right ilium from the Tecovas Formation in Texas. Hunt et al. distinguished this taxon from the herrerasaurids Staurikosaurus and Herrerasaums based on the elongate, dorsoventrally narrow posterior blade, a narrow ridge on the lateral margin, the reduced brevis fossa and a semicircular margin dorsal to the acetabulum. Similarly, they separated Caseosaurus from the herrerasaurid Chindesaurus bryansmalli Long and Murry by the less deep brevis shelf. Again, I agree with the assessment of Hunt et al. that this fossil represents a herrerasaurid, but doubt that it is truly diagnostic at the genus level. This is especially true because many features of primitive theropod and \"poposaurid\" hips are remarkably similar, and the two taxa only be separated by examining the actual orientation of the ilium in the pelvis . This is not possible with UMMP 8870 as the sacral ribs are not present . Thus, I consider Caseosaurus crosbyensis a probable herrerasaurid but still a nomen dubium. E.C. Case collected the holotype specimen of Spinosuchus caseanus Huene from the Tecovas Formation of West Texas in the 1920s. This taxon has remained enigmatic since its first discovery . Presently it is embedded in a half-relief plaster wall mount at UMMP. Hunt et al. detailed its probable theropod nature, but the actual status of this fossil remains equivocal. Recently, Robert Kahle discovered similar vertebrae with extremely tall neural spines at NMMNH locality 3775, which is slightly younger, perhaps even Revueltian . This locality also yields abundant remains of the aberrant archosauromorph Trilophosaums . This is the first co-occurrence of Spinosuchus with Trilophosaums and would appear to be evidence supporting Richard's recent hypothesis that Spinosuchus and Trilophosaums are the same animal. However vertebrae of Spinosuchus, as photographically illustrated by Case differ greatly from illustrations of the vertebral column of Trilophosaums in having neural spines that are proportionately taller and narrower in lateral view. Trilophosaums does superficially resemble Spinosuchus in its possession of moderately tall neural spines in the caudal series. However, the dorsal vertebral series are entirely different, with Trilophosaums bearing low neural spines over its comparatively shorter dorsal centra, as opposed to the tall neural spines on longer centra in Spinosuchus. Hunt et al. tentatively considered this fossil a theropod because it possesses hollow centra and Hunt et al. and consider this a derived, aberrant theropod. There are other Triassic archosauromorphs that possess similar \"sails\" or at least elongate neural spines, including Ctenosauriscus koeneni from the upper Buntsandstein and Lotosaurus from the Middle Triassic of China . Spinosuchus does not appear closely related to either-Ctenosauriscus has a much taller sail, with neural spines more than five times as tall as the centra , and Lotosaurus is clearly a much more primitive taxon with more robust vertebrae with thick neural spines . Hunt et al. reported two additional, fragmentary theropods from the Blue Mesa Member of the Petrified Forest Formation in the PEFO in eastern Arizona. These theropods remain undescribed at this time, but appear to be ceratosaur-grade and occur in the same general vicinity and same stratigraphic level as Dying Grounds and the type Adamanian fauna. Theropods from the middle Chinle Group in Arizona, New Mexico and Texas are generally more fragmentary than the late Camian dinosaurs. Herrerasaurs include Chindesaurus bryansmalli Long and Murry from the PEFO and several fragmentary herrerasaurids from the Bull Canyon Formation in eastern New Mexico and West Texas from eastern New Mexico, Eucoelo physis baldwini Sullivan and Lucas from northern New Mexico , and at least one ceratosaur from the PEFO . Parrish reported indeterminate theropods from the Chinle in Utah. Problematic theropod taxa from the middle Chinle Group include the putative bird Protoavis texensis Chatterjee and the putative omithomimosaur Shuvosaurus inexpectatus Chatteijee. Long and Murry named Chindesaurus bryansmalli based on a partial skel eton of an herrerasaur collected from the Painted Desert Member o f the Petrified Forest Formation in the PEFO. This moderately large herrerasaur is distin guished by several features of the astragalus . Consequently, I disagree with Long and Murry and refer no specimens to this genus outside of the holotype, as the astragalus is not preserved in any of the other specimens they refer to Chindesaurus, and many of these fossils are not even convincingly dinosaurian. Hunt and Hunt et al. used herrerasaur \"B\" and herrerasaur \"C\" to describe two taxa from the Bull Canyon Formation in the middle Chinle Group. provided more detailed descriptions of the fragmentary fossils constituting Hunt et al.'s \"herrerasaurid B\" from exposures in the type area of the Bull Can-yon Formation and \"herrerasaurid C\" from the same unit at Revuelto Creek. The latter is the same area that yielded the holotype of Gojirasaurus. Carpenter named Gojirasaurus quayi Carpenter, from the Bull Canyon Formation in eastern New Mexico. This large ceratosaur was previously described, but not named, by Parrish and Carpenter , and also mentioned by Car penter and Parrish , , Lucas and Hunt , Parrish , and Long and Murry . H untet al. identified this as \"herrerasaurid A\" from the Bull Canyon Formation. The holotype of Gojirasaurus consists of fragmen tary ribs, centra, a scapula, a pubis, a tibia, and a metatarsal . Based on the tibia, Carpenter estimated a body length of 5.5 m, which makes this one of the largest Upper Triassic theropods. The ceratosaur Eucoelophysis baldwini and associated fossils from the Painted Desert Member of the Petrified Forest Formation in northern New Mexico encompass at least some of the type material of Coelophysis Cope . Note that, with the exception of Colbert and the Whitaker quarry theropod. This list includes, but is not limited to, Welles , Padian , Hunt and Lucas , Paul , Long and Murry , Sullivan et al. and Sullivan and Lucas . However, in 1996 the ICZN ruled in favor of Colbert et al.'s petition and established a neotype for Coelophysis bauri Cope from the Whitaker quarry specimens, contra Lucas , Paul , Sullivan , Huber and Sullivan et al. . detailed a new record of Eucoelophysis and another, larger coelophysoid that may represent a distinct taxon from near the type locality in the Petri fied Forest Formation near Arroyo Seco. Clearly, the taxonomic details and complications of theropods from the vicinity of Ghost Ranch are beyond the scope of this paper. Here I simply note that I consider Eucoelophysis the only valid Revueltian ceratosaur in the Chama basin. The type locality is well above the base of the Painted Desert Member locally , as are the Eucoelophysis sp. records at the Snyder quarry . The holotype of Longosaurus longicollis , AMNH 2705, is a fragmentary ilium that is heavily, and possibly speculatively, reconstructed by Huene . In credibly, this taxon has never been addressed in the debate regarding the proper name of the Whitaker quarry theropod . Presently, I consider this a nomen dubium, which is also the apparent but unstated decision of Sullivan and Lucas who do not consider any of the Cope material except for a proximal pubis diagnostic. Details of bone color, texture, and preservation, as well as comparison with Baldwin's field notes indicate that the Cope collection probably came from the same stratigraphic level as Eucoelophysis . Padian , Long and Murry and Hunt et al. have also reported ceratosaurs from the Painted Desert Member of the Petrified Forest Formation in PEFO. The best of these, the so-called \"Padian theropod\" of Long and Murry , is a small ceratosaur that has not been named. Padian demonstrated that much of this speci men, UCMP 129618, is exceedingly similar to some of the Cope material, and thus may be synonymous with Eucoelophysis. This theropod comes from just above a prominent, bench-forming sandstone in PEFO that Billingsley mapped as Painted Desert 2 and described as Painted Desert 3. This sandstone is at least 30 m above the base of the Painted Desert Member . All of the coelophysids described above co-occur with Revueltian index fossils. However, all of them also occur well above the FAD of these fossils, frequently by 50 m or more . Thus, the apparent FAD of coelophysids may be a biostratigraphically significant event that occurs higher than the FAD of Revueltian index taxa. Parrish reported fragmentary theropods from the Painted Desert Member of the Petrified Forest Formation in Utah, noting similarities with Coelophysis but no char acteristics more diagnostic to a lower level than Theropoda. Parrish and Good reported a fragmentary scute of the aetosaur Typothorax from these strata, indicating a Revueltian age for the Utah theropods. Chatterjee in the Revueltian Bull Canyon Formation , and, more recently, the \"Kirkpatrick quarry\" in the Tecovas Formation near the Kalgary localities . The Kirkpatrick quarry specimens are, like the type material, frag mentary and heavily reconstructed. The fragmentary and dissociated material of the type material of Protoavis complicates assessment of its phylogenetic position. Indeed, many workers refer to Protoavis not as a single taxon, but as an amalgamation or chimera or even a 'fauna' as \"there is reason to suspect that Protoavis represents a death assem blage of different animals instead of associated parts of a single kind of animal\" . Furthermore, much of the material is extensively reconstructed, and new material changes published interpretations dramatically . The following evaluation highlights some of these complications and demon strates the theropod affinities of some of the fossils assigned to Protoavis. It appears that many of the fossils Chatterjee probably represents paired ischia of an indeterminate archosaur, and actually superficially resembles the lateral scutes of Desmatosuchus-grade aetosaurs. The heavily reconstructed humeri closely resemble those of Trilophosaums as illustrated by Gregory . In particular, the deltopectoral crest is much reduced, medially deflected, and flush with the shaft anteriorly, exactly as described and illustrated by Gregory . The radius illustrated by Chatterjee may not be oriented correctly and is not diagnostic of any archosaur at the genus level. Chatteijee's [Kirby, 1989 [Kirby, , 1991 [Kirby, , 1993 ) are of a much smaller taxon). Thus, the occurrence o f Trilophosaums in the Post quarry is not as sig nificant a range extension as it would have been several years ago, when it was known only from the Otischalkian. In spite of these problems, at least some of the material Chatterjee . Doubtless these repre sent a theropod, as do many of the hollow limb bones. The proximal femora are probably ceratosaurian, but the composites are based on specimens from both formations. The fused astragalocalcaneum is exceedingly similar to those of Camposaums, Lilienstemus, Coelophysis, and, possibly, Eucoelophysis and is definitely ceratosaurian . Therefore, it is clear that there is at least one ceratosaurian theropod at the Post quarry. As originally described by Chatterjee , the putative omithomimosaur Shuvosaurus inexpectatus exhibited no synapomorphies of the Dinosauria and Hunt et al. considered at least some of the material Chatterjee assigned to Shuvosaums to represent a problematic archosaur, perhaps the aberrant rauisuchian Chatterjeea elegans Long and Murry. Hunt argued that, if this is the case, then Shuvosaurus is the proper name for this rauisuchian, by priority. Rauhut demonstrated that in cranial material referred to Shuvosaurus, the postfrontal was absent and that the lacrimal was Lshaped in lateral view and exposed on the skull roof dorsally, characteristics of dinosaurs and theropods, respectively. Rauhut and Hunt et al. independently as serted that the supposed synapomorphies of the Omithomimosauria in Shuvosaurus are, at best, unconvincing because of poor preservation. Shuvosaurus only superficially resembles the older archosauromorph Lotosaurus, which is also edentulous but lacks, for example, an antorbital fenestra . Whatever this taxon is, Long and Murry and Hunt et al. noted the presence of similar fossils in the Bull Canyon Formation of east-central New Mexico and the Painted Desert Member of the Petrified Forest Formation in Arizona. Obviously, the central problem with Shuvosaurus is that, like almost other taxon with a holotype from the Post quarry, the original type and referred material appears to represent a chimera of two or more taxa . The list of problematic taxa established on Post quarry type material now includes, at a minimum, Postosuchus kirkpatricki Chatterjee , Protoavis texensis Chatterjee , Shuvosaurus inexpectatus Chatterjee and, possibly, Chatterjeea elegans Long and Murry . I have attempted to sort out some of the problems of Protoavis and Shuvosaurus here, but further review and comparison of the type material with other fossils remains necessary. Eventually each of these taxa will need to be re-evaluated, probably by resort ing to comparison of non-type material that demonstrates better association, especially of postcranial elements. All of the theropods discussed in this section co-occur with one or more of the following age-diagnostic taxa: the aetosaur Typothorax coccinarum Cope, the aetosaur Aetosaurus arcuatus , or the phytosaur Pseudopalatus Mehl. All of these are index taxa of the Revueltian Ivf . Thus, there are at least three herrerasaurs, as many as three ceratosaurs, and several problematic theropods in the middle Chinle Group of early-mid-Norian age . Unlike the underlying rocks, strata of Apachean age in the Chinle Group contain abundant tetrapod footprints and relatively few body fossils. Aside from the abundant ceratosaur skeletons at the Whitaker quarry, almost all theropod fossils from the upper Chinle Group are trace fossils assigned to the ichnogenus Grallator Hitchcock. 318 The Whitaker quarry produces abundant remains of the ceratosaur Coelophysis . There appear to be both \"gracile\" and \"robust\" morphotypes at the Whitaker quarry, and workers have assigned one or the other to Coelophysis and the other to Syntarsus . Recent statistical studies demonstrate that there are three morphotypes, although whether these morphotypes represent males, females, and juveniles, or three age classes is unclear . Sexual dimorphism is apparent in Syntarsus rhodesiensis , suggest ing that variation in the Whitaker quarry sample to be intraspecific. Coelophysis and its sister taxon Syntarsus are the most derived coelophysoids, and Coelophysis is the most derived Triassic theropod known and Olsen et al. that Agialopous and Coelurosaurichnus are probably junior subjective synonyms of Grallator. Olsen and Baird believed that the nature and association of manus prints with tridactyl pes prints of Atreipus indicated that the Atreipus track maker was an omithischian. However, Weems and Hunt and Lucas stated that that the manus prints are inconclusive and could represent occasional manus tracks by a theropod, and Haubold and Klein considered them no more diagnostic than of a dinosauriform trackmaker, so there are no unambiguous tracks of Late Triassic omithischians. The vast majority of Chinle Group theropod footprints occur in rocks of, or correla tive to, the Rock Point Formation in Utah, Wyoming, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Arizona . These records include isolated tracks and trackways of Grallator from the Rock Point Formation of Utah and \"Agialopous\" from the Bell Springs Formation in Wyoming . The records from New Mexico and Oklahoma are much more extensive, and include diverse ichnofaunas from the Sloan Canyon, Sheep Pen, Rock Point, and Redonda Formations . and Hunt et al. recently reviewed this record in New Mexico and removed many of the previous records of Grallator, largely attributing them to poorly preserved Pseudo tetrasauropus. Still, recognize Grallator from the Redonda Forma tion at Mesa Redonda and Apache Canyon in east-central New Mexico and the Sloan Canyon Formation at Peacock Canyon and Sloan Canyon in northeastern New Mexico. Records of Grallator from the Sheep Pen Formation are restricted to the panhandle of Oklahoma described here and by Harris et al. , and an isolated prosauropod vertebra reported by Hunt et al. . Possible prosauropod fossils were also reported here from the Tecovas Formation at lower Kalgary and the Bluewater Creek Formation at Sixmile Spring . Fossils described by Long and Murry as possible prosauropods are only identifiable as dinosaurs and are discussed in more detail below. Long and Murry referred, without explanation, a proximal femur from the Blue Mesa Member at PEFO, a distal tibia from the Placerias quarry, and a partial pes from the Bull Canyon Formation to the Prosauropoda. None of these elements possess definitive synapomorphies of the Prosauropoda sensu Galton or Sereno . The femoral fragment does possess an offset head and the tibia is notched to accommodate the ascending process of the astragalus. The pes is unillustrated. In short, the various elements referred to Prosauro poda by Long and Murry are almost certainly dinosaurian, but could represent basal saurischians, herrerasaurids, or prosauropods, and thus I consider them Dinosauria indet. The upper Kalgary prosauropod tooth was discussed previously and will be de scribed in detail by . This tooth is from the Tecovas Formation and of Adamanian age. Chatterjee named the omithischian dinosaur Technosaurus smalli for a variety of fragmentary skull and postcranial bones from the Post quarry in the Revueltian Bull Canyon Formation. Sereno removed the premaxilla and poste rior dentary of Technosaurus smalli from the holotype and considered them representa tive of an indeterminate prosauropod based on the presence of an L-shaped premaxillamaxilla suture and straight, lanceolate crowns. Hunt followed this assessment and noted the presence of a single prosauropod cervical centrum from the Revueltian Bull Canyon Formation in New Mexico as the only other body fossil of Upper Triassic prosauropods from western North America. Kirby . Much of this work documents the record of Upper Triassic omithischian dinosaurs in the Chinle Group, so I provide only a brief summary here. It is now clear that Upper Triassic omithischians are much more common and diverse than previously assumed. Otischalkian omithischians include Pekinosaurus, Protecovasaurus, and Crosbysaurus, all from Texas. Adamanian omithischians include Tecovasaurus, Protecovasaurus, Crosbysaurus, Pekinosaurus, Revueltosaurus hunti and, possibly, Galtonia from diverse localities in Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona. Revueltian records include the types of R. callenderi, Lucianosaurus wildi and Technosaurus smalli from the Bull Canyon Forma tion of New Mexico and Texas . R. callenderi is also known from the Painted Desert Member of the Petrified Forest Formation in Arizona . recently reported a probable omithischian tooth from the Trujillo Formation in West Texas, which is slightly older than the Bull Canyon Formation but still Revueltian . Kirby . Unlike the Chinle Group, the Newark Supergroup in the eastern U.S.A. and Canada preserves numerous stratigraphically superposed footprint faunas, but very few body fossils. Historically this record was considered entirely Triassic, so more recent work demonstrating that the upper portion of the Newark Supergroup is, in fact, Jurassic, has greatly reduced its Triassic dinosaur record. With the recognition that much of the uppermost Newark Supergroup is of Jurassic, not Triassic age, all Newark Supergroup theropod body fossils and most of the famous theropod footprint localities are now part of the Early Jurassic ichnofauna . Consequently, the Newark Supergroup in eastern North America yields no body fossils of Triassic theropods. The holotype of Podokesaurus holyokensis Talbot and casts of theropod bones attributed to Coelophysis sp. , originally considered to be Triassic in age, were probably derived from the Portland Formation and thus are of Jurassic age Norman, 1990) . Huber et al. established provincial land-vertebrate faunachrons for the Newark Supergroup. These are, from oldest to youngest, the Sanfordian, Conewagian, Cliftonian and Neshanician and are, within resolution, equivalent to the Otischalkian, Adamanian, Revueltian, and Apachean . However, unlike the Chinle Group, theropod footprints are known from nearly the entire stratigraphic section of the Newark Super group. Footprints of Grallator and related ichnotaxa occur in rocks of late Camian to Rhaetian age throughout much of the Newark Supergroup and have been reported by numerous workers, dating to the pioneering work of Hitchcock in the 19lh century . A variety of ichnogeneric names have been assigned to tridactyl tetrapod footprints in the Newark Supergroup. These include Grallator Hitchcock, Eubrontes Hitchcock, Kayentapus Welles, Anchisauripus Hitchcock, Atreipus Olsen and Baird, Otouphepus Cushman, and Stenonyx , many of which have multiple ichnospecies . Weems argued that of these, only Eubrontes, Grallator, and Kayentapus are valid. Olsen et al. restudied the type material of Grallator, Eubrontes, and Anchisauripus and argued that all three ichnogenera are probably valid, and were made by theropod trackmakers. In general, Triassic theropod footprint assemblages are domi nated by Grallator, and Jurassic assemblages by Eubrontes, and, to a much lesser extent, Kayentapus . Thus, the entire Triassic theropod fossil record of the Newark Supergroup consists of a variety of Grallator and Grallator-like footprints from strata ranging from late Camian to Rhaetian in age . Haubold and Klein interpreted these tracks as a progression from a primitive dinosauriform through a more derived dinosauromorph {Atreipus) to, finally, a theropod {Grallator). Upper Triassic Newark Supergroup sauropodomorphs are limited to the ichnogenera Pseudotetrasauropus and Tetrasauropus . The putative prosauropod \"Thecodontosaurus\" gibbidens Cope is, in fact, the omithischian Galtonia gibbidens . Similarly, the prosaur opods Anchisaurus polyzelus Hitchcock and Ammosaurus major , long thought to be Triassic . Upper Triassic omithischian body fossils in the Newark Supergroup are limited to isolated teeth, including the holo-and paratypes of Pekinosaurus olseni and Galtonia gibbidens, as well as an undescribed omithischian from Nova Scotia . The type locality of Pekinosaurus olseni is in the Pekin Formation of North Carolina, which also yields fossils of the aetosaur Longosuchus, an Otischalkian index taxon . The holotype of Galtonia gibbidens comes from the New Oxford Formation, which also yielded the phytosaur Rutiodon {sensu Ballew, 1989 ; see also Doyle and Sues, 1995) , establishing the Adamanian age of that unit . The Nova Scotia omithis chian co-occurs with fragmentary remains of the metoposaurid temnospondyl Metoposaurus and is thus of Otischalkian age . I follow Haubold and Klein and consider Atreipus no more diagnostic than of a \"dinosauriform\" trackmaker. This greatly reduces the omithischian ichnofossil record of the Newark, which was based heavily on records of Atreipus . Banisterobates boisseau Fraser and Olsen is grossly similar to Atreipus, and probably also represents the track of a dinosauromorph . Upper Triassic dinosaurs from Greenland include body and trace fossils of theropods and body fossils of prosauropods, all from the Fleming Fjord Formation . 323 T heropods Jenkins et al. first described the Upper Triassic tetrapod fauna of Greenland. To date, the only theropod body fossil is an indeterminate, moderately large theropod consisting of \"disassociated vertebrae and ribs, a partial pelvis and hindlimb, including a femur and phalanges\" from the upper Bjergkroneme beds in the 0rsted Dal Member of the Fleming Fjord Formation . Jenkins et al. also reported numerous trackways of Grallator sp. from the 0rsted Dal Member. The occurrence of the aetosaur Aetosaurus with the theropod fossils of the 0rsted Dal Member indicates a Revueltian age for this fauna Fig. 13 .3). Jenkins et al. also reported several partial skeletons of Plateosaurus engelhardti Meyer from the Carlsberg Fjord beds of the 0rsted Dal Member of the Fleming Fjord Formation. Unfortunately, these fossils were discovered well to the south of the aetosaurs described by Jenkins et al. , so their stratigraphic position relative to these Revueltian index fossils remains unclear . Other tetrapods from the Carlsberg Fjord beds include the plagiosaurid Gerrothorax cf. G. pulcherrimus and the capitosaurid Cyclotosaurus cf. C. posthumus . Although these taxa are characteristic of the Revueltian , their first occurrence in Greenland is in the underlying Malmros Klint Member of the Fleming Fjord Formation . The occurrence o f the turtle cf. Proganochelys in the upper part of the 0rsted Dal Member could also be either Revueltian or Apachean in age. Magnetostratigraphy indicates that the 0rsted Dal Mem ber is Norian, possibly late Norian to Rhaetian . Throughout Europe, Plateosaurus occurs in strata overlying strata of unambiguous Revueltian age but below strata of Rhaetian age . It is clear that the FAD o f Plateosaurus is consistently above the FAD of Aetosaurus in western Europe and thus Plateosaurus may be an index taxon of the Apachean Ivf. However, difficulties in correlating bed-level units of the Fleming Fjord Formation preclude testing this hypothesis in Greenland at this time. These are the only confirmed records of Plateosaurus outside of the European continent . Putative Middle Triassic records of dinosaurs from Europe are generally indetermin ate . In particular, Galton and Walker reviewed the body fossils of the Bromsgrove Sandstone Formation in England and convincingly demonstrated that none of them pertain to dinosaurs, contra Huene and Walker . Incidentally, I agree with this interpretation, but doubt that the teeth they identify belong to parasuchids and instead consider them Archosauriformes indet. Similarly, Rauhut and Hungerbuhler demonstrated that the putative theropod Avipes dillstedtianus from the Middle Triassic Grenz dolomit is an indeterminate digitigrade archosaur. King and Benton reviewed the record of putative Early and Middle Triassic dinosaur ichnofossils in Great Britain and determined, convincingly, that none of those records were of dinosaurian trackmakers. The Triassic theropod fossil record of Europe includes body fossils from the United Kingdom, France, and Germany, with numerous footprints from several localities, re viewed to various degrees most recently by Norman , and Rauhut and Hungerbuhler . The Lossiemouth Sandstone of Elgin, Scotland yields probable theropod fossils assigned to Saltopus elginensis Huene. The Lossiemouth Sandstone is the type stratum of the aetosaur Stagonolepis robertsoni Agassiz, and thus is of Adaman ian age. Walker and Benton and Walker considered Salto pus a \"coelurosaur,\" but their descriptions make clear that, in current usage, Saltopus would be a ceratosaur . Norman reviewed the problem atic theropods, and declared Saltopus elginensis a nomen dubium. Benton et al. and Rauhut and Hungerbuhler considered this poorly preserved taxon a dino sauriform incertae sedis. Because of its strong theropod affinities and latest Camian age, I include it in this review as one of the oldest known theropods, possibly an herrerasaur. The fissure-fill assemblages developed in Carboniferous limestone around the Bristol Channel area and in South Wales produce fragmentary Triassic theropod fossils, primarily isolated teeth . Rauhut and Hungerbuhler identified a 325 fragmentary theropod skeleton from the Welsh fissure-fill Pant-y-ffynnon as 1 Syntarsus sp. The specimen in question is definitely ceratosaurian, with a partially fused pelvis and dorsal vertebrae with transverse processes that are triangular in dorsal view. Rauhut and Hungerbuhler also noted that shared elements are similar to those of Procompsognathus. Since Rauhut and Hungerbuhler wrote their manuscript, Tykoski described the osteology of Syntarsus kayentakatae Rowe and another, unnamed theropod from the Early Jurassic and Sullivan and Lucas named Eucoelophysis baldwini. I agree with Rauhut and Hungerbuhler that their description and illustra tions show striking similarities to Procompsognathus and note here that the Welsh theropod is distinct from Eucoelophysis and Syntarsus kayentakatae, so I consider it an indeterminate coelophysoid pending further study. Theropod body fossils from the Upper Triassic in Germany occur throughout the Stubensandstein-Knollenmergel interval, with k'Dolichosuchus\" the oldest and Lilienstemus lilienstemi the stratigraphically highest .

As with the tooth spacing, this may have taxonomic significance, although we refrain from further comment until more material is prepared. Damage to teeth of NMMNH P-29959 and P-29960 prevents us from describing detailed features such as possible wear facets with confidence. The humerus is elongate, with slightly expanded proximal and distal ends . The deltopectoral crest forms a small, medially directed knob in the middle of the proximal expansion, and there is a thin but prominent process forming the posterior margin of the proximal expansion. The distal end is rotated slightly medially, so that the shaft appears somewhat twisted. The elongate ectepicondylar groove is poorly preserved but present. In distal view, the radial and ulnar condyles lie on the anterior half of the distal end, with the distal expansion almost entirely posterior to the ulnar condyle. This bone corresponds in all details to humeri of Trilophosaurus buettneri described by Gregory . The tibia is less well preserved . The proximal head is broadly expanded transversely, with prominent articular facets for the distal condyles of the femur on the posterior portion. The medial facet is slightly larger than the lateral facet. A weakly developed cnemial crest is present. The shaft is thin and slightly convex anteriorly. The distal end is unexpanded, with a slight sulcus anteroiaterally for reception of the ascending process of the astragalus. This bone, too, corresponds in all details to tibiae of Trilophosaurus buettneri described by Gregory . The associated femur? from the same field jacket lacks both proximal and distal ends. The resulting shaft is considerably more stout than either of the other limb bones described, with a rounded center and flattened proximal and distal ends. The preserved bone is nearly as long as the associated tibia, and is thus similar in proportions to femora of Trilophosaurus . A nearly complete caudal centrum from the same jacket is elongate, with a fused neural arch. The centrum is amphicoelous, with the anterior face slightly concave and the posterior face deeply so. In lateral view, the centrum appears slightly concave ventrally. The neural arch is long and low, and fused along approximately 80% of the centrum length. Most of the neural processes are broken, but the posterior zygopophyses slope abruptly dorsally at an angle approximately 45° to the dorsal surface of the centrum. We recovered one possible omithischian tooth from NMMNH locality 3775. This tooth, NMMNH P-34106, is triangular in outline , very slightly asymmetric in occlusal view , possesses denticles that are somewhat oblique to the tooth margin and has a basal constriction near the root . In these respects it confonns to descriptions of Upper Triassic omithischian teeth given by Hunt and Lucas . However, the tooth is also mod- tall relative to its mesio-distal length and is only slightly and in these respects resembles teeth of basal sau-_ ..... ''',..,.,'n'', principally prosauropods. In either case, it clearly a herbivorous dinosaur. this tooth is an omithischian, it most closely resembles '1LeltoSaw'-u')' callenderi Hunt, 1989 in its moderately tall, tricrown, but is less asymmetric in occlusal view. It is less than most Revueltosaurus presumed maxillary/dentary but considerably more compressed than many Revueltopremaxillary teeth. It is also significantly smaller than olotype and referred specimens of that taxon, and appears more fine denticles. Notably, the holotype and paratype of Revueltosallrus have crowns rom tall, while NMMNH P-34106 is no more than 3 mm Ig. 3D), and is decidedly more labio-lingually compressed 3I-K). NMMNH P-34106 is distinct from all other Triassic _;n\"h\",,,,.,,,, including Galtonia, Tecovasallrus, Lllcianosau-Tecnhosaurus.

{"text": "Regarding the second issue, the scandentian fossil record is quite poor the enclosure of the intratympanic portion of the internal carotid artery in a bony canal that is Xoored proximally and distally by the entotympanic and by the petrosal in between, the enclosure of the intratympanic portion of the stapedial artery by the petrosal in a canal on the promontorium and within the epitympanic crest beneath the tympanic roof, the absence of a foramen of exit for the arteria diploëtica magna, an alisphenoid canal, a maxillary artery that passes medial to the mandibular nerve beneath foramen ovale, and a laryngeopharyngeal artery\" ; scaphoid and lunate fused into scapholunate ; and articular facet for medial malleolus on the posterior side of the sustentaculum . Although some of these character states are also found in Euprimates , others appear to be unique to Scandentia. For example, both the Wrst and last conditions may represent scandentian synapomorphies that unite Ptilocercus and other treeshrews. While the monophyly of Scandentia is well-supported, the supraordinal relationships of this group have been a matter of great debate . For example, treeshrews have been proposed to be closely related to euprimates , colugos , and lagomorphs . However, the Scandentia + Euprimates clade has not been supported by molecular or morphological evidence . Furthermore, some of the analyses that supported a Scandentia + Lagomorpha clade do not represent adequate tests because they either never tested a Scandentia +Dermoptera relationship or they did not include Dermoptera in their analysis . However, the Arnason et al. analysis of 12 mitochondrial protein-coding genes did include Dermoptera and a Scandentia + Lagomorpha clade was still supported. This conXicts with the results of Murphy et al. , who supported Scandentia + Dermoptera and Lagomorpha + Rodentia clades in their analysis of 19 nuclear and 3 mitochondrial genes, which is the largest molecular dataset to date for placental mammals. Sundatheria, which refers to the distribution of treeshrews and colugos in the greater Sundaland region of Southeast Asia, has been supported by many additional studies , making Dermoptera the most appropriate outgroup for analysis of scandentian intraordinal relationships. In addition to Sundatheria and Glires, Murphy et al. also supported Sundatheria +Primates and Euarchonta + Glires clades. Despite all these studies of placentalian supraordinal relationships, the intraordinal relationships of treeshrews have been largely ignored . The order Scandentia has traditionally included the single family Tupaiidae, which was divided into the subfamilies Tupaiinae and Ptilocercinae by Lyon . This higher-level classiWcation has largely been adopted by subsequent authors . Recently, Helgen elevated these two groups to families, Tupaiidae and Ptilocercidae . This division, whether at the familial or subfamilial level, has gone largely unchallenged. However, Davis proposed that Lyon's division of the family into two subfamilies was invalid because Dendrogale is morphologically intermediate between Ptilocercus and other treeshrews. This proposal has, however, been repeatedly rejected in other studies of treeshrew morphology and taxonomy . Davis also suggested that Dendrogale may be the most primitive treeshrew, which contradicted Le Gros Clark's contention that Ptilocercus is the most primitive living treeshrew. Again, Davis' suggestion has not been supported by subsequent studies, which have instead upheld Le Gros Clark's hypothesis . The only support for Davis' hypothesis comes from StaVord and Thorington's study of carpal morphology in which they proposed that Dendrogale's carpus is primitive among treeshrews . Compared to the few debates regarding the basal relationships among treeshrews, those concerning generic distinction have been more controversial . For example, the classiWcation of the Table 1 Taxonomy of treeshrews Current taxonomy and distribution of treeshrews, following Helgen , and GenBank accession numbers for species included in phylogenetic analyses . Numbers in parentheses following accession numbers are used in Figs. 1 and 2 to identify individuals of the same species. a From Timmins et al.

More recently, Helgen recognized Anathana as a separate genus from Tupaia, but considered the two taxa to be closely related. However, the relationships of Anathana to various species of Tupaia have never been explored . The monophyly of the relatively speciose genus Tupaia has been challenged by Han et al. , who claimed that Urogale should be included in Tupaia. Urogale was considered to be the sister taxon to a monophyletic Tupaia in the immunodiVusion study conducted by Dene et al. recently proposed, based on DNA hybridization and morphometric analysis of external and cranial characters, that Urogale everetti may be nested within Tupaia. This conclusion is also supported by postcranial evidence , but all of these contradictory conclusions must be considered with caution because they are the results of phenetic analyses with extremely limited taxon sampling. Only a phylogenetic analysis that includes data from several more taxa will resolve the issue of the monophyly of Tupaia. In addition to questions regarding the monophyly of Tupaia, the number of species included in this genus has varied from 32 to 11 in the last 90 years. Within Scandentia, 120 described forms have been proposed since the Wrst species of treeshrew was described in 1820. A full review of this tumultuous taxonomic history is beyond the scope of this paper, and we agree emphatically with Wilson that a thorough taxonomic review is desperately needed. One Wnal problem in treeshrew systematics, beyond taxonomic recognition of various genera and species, is that phylogenetic analyses based on morphological data have not resolved intergeneric relationships . Steele's cluster analysis was problematic because Anathana was not included in his study. Butler and Luckett both included Anathana in their analyses, but they also assumed generic monophyly . Furthermore, their cladistic analyses produced diVerent results regarding the relationships of treeshrew genera. Our reanalysis of the data from these three studies showed that the most parsimonious trees were not published in the original papers , but even our parsimony analyses failed to resolve intergeneric relationships. In addition to these problems, the original studies did not include non-scandentian outgroups, nor did they agree on character codings . We have begun to address these problems in a forthcoming study on the morphological systematics of treeshrews that will include outgroups, identify voucher specimens, investigate character state variation, and test generic monophyly. To address several of these issues, we have conducted a phylogenetic analysis of all living treeshrew genera and all but four species based on variation in the mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene . Several characteristics of 12S make it a desirable marker for investigating phylogenetic relationships among mammals. First, it is extremely well-characterized in mammals due to its popular use for over a decade in studies of mammalian interrelationships . The secondary structure of the small ribosomal subunit in mammals has been rigorously modeled by Springer and Douzery , allowing alignments based on structural features rather than simple sequence similarity alone, which has been shown to improve phylogenetic inference , making it possible to design PCR primers that will amplify overlapping fragments of varying length. Because no fresh tissues are available for a number of treeshrew species whose inclusion in this study is critical to our objectives, the ability to amplify short pieces of mtDNA is a distinct advantage given the availability of degraded tissues often present on museum specimens. Finally, while relatively conserved regions of the gene tend to be useful for recovering deeper nodes in phylogenetic analysis, more variable positions, usually found in non-pairing regions of the transcribed molecule , extend the utility of 12S to more recently divergent nodes as well. We have taken advantage of these features of the 12S gene to infer the phylogenetic relationships among treeshrews. Our speciWc objectives are to: explore the widely hypothesized but heretofore untested phylogenetic position of Ptilocercus as the sister taxon to all other living treeshrews; determine whether Dendrogale is more closely related to other tupaiids or to Ptilocercus; elucidate relationships among species in the taxonomically diverse genus Tupaia; and determine whether the resulting phylogeny places the controversial genera Anathana and Urogale within the genus Tupaia, as some authors have suggested . Complete sequences from the mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene were obtained from GenBank, museum specimens, and zoo animals representing 23 individuals assigned to 16 species. Of the 20 currently recognized species of treeshrew, 4 are not represented in this study due to our unsuccessful attempts to obtain material suitable for DNA extraction . DNA from 10 of the museum specimens and the single zoo animal was extracted from fresh frozen muscle or organ tissues using the animal tissue protocols in the PureGene or Qiagen DNeasy kits. For the remaining six taxa for which fresh tissues were unavailable, dried tissue picked from museum skulls and/or skeletons was used for DNA extractions. Samples were soaked overnight in sterile water at room temperature, decanted, washed repeatedly in 70% ethanol , and air-dried at room temperature for several hours. The PureGene kit was then used to extract DNA following the animal tissue protocol, with additional proteinase-K added at half day intervals as necessary until all tissue had been digested . PuriWed DNA was re-suspended in 30 L water, but the Wnal concentration used varied widely, with some samples yielding PCR products only when diluted 10-or 100-fold. AmpliWcations were performed following Olson et al. for fresh tissue extractions. Cycling parameters , MgCl 2 concentration , and template volumes were adjusted as necessary for dried tissue extractions and often diVered depending on the primer combinations employed. Ampli-Taq Gold polymerase was used in varying concentrations for the degraded samples; custom-made Taq was used for all fresh samples. DiVerent PCR and sequencing strategies were employed according to the quality of the extracted DNA. For relatively intact, high-quality DNA , the entire 12S gene was ampliWed using primers located on the tRNA-Phe gene and the tRNA-Val or 16S gene . Either two or three separate sequencing reactions were performed on each puriWed PCR product using the same Xanking primers as those used in the initial PCR, with two or four overlapping internal primers, respectively. For degraded DNA, much shorter pieces had to be ampliWed . In all, 33 diVerent primers were used in various combinations in this study, many of which were designed speciWcally for treeshrews based on sequences from GenBank and fresh samples. Because of the degraded nature of the DNA extracted from dried tissues, as many as 10 individual, overlapping PCR products were necessary to reconstruct the entire 12S gene for some specimens. Primer sequences and their location on the published mitochondrial genome of Tupaia belangeri are given in Appendix B. A schematic representation of the primer combina-tions used to generate sequences from degraded samples is provided in Appendix C. All PCR products were puriWed using the GeneClean protocol following the manufacturer's instructions. UnquantiWed aliquots of puriWed PCR product were cycle-sequenced for both strands using the BigDye Ready Reaction Kit following the manufacturer's directions, other than using 10 L reaction volumes with reagents scaled down accordingly. Sequencing reactions were puriWed using either ethanol or ethanol/NaAc precipitation. Samples were electrophoresed on either an ABI 377 or 3100 automated sequencer . The resulting sequences were edited and compiled using Sequencher 4.1 . All sequences in this study have been deposited to GenBank . Concatenating multiple, short sequence fragments generated from degraded DNA into longer continuous sequences is fraught with potential problems . Foremost among these is the risk of contamination from a number of sources and the subsequent inadvertent reconstruction of chimaeric sequences . While a number of studies and commentaries have emphasized the issue of contamination and have suggested rigorous measures for preventing it , relatively few papers have addressed the equally critical need for verifying sequence authenticity and preventing the unintentional concatenation of chimaeric sequences . Following standard procedures for safeguarding against contamination from extraneous DNA can be considered a separate issue from the risk of amplifying non-target DNA present in a given sample. This is particularly true when DNA is extracted from archival museum specimens, which may have been handled by several individuals during the course of preparation and subsequent examination, in addition to having been subjected to either microbial digestion or dermestid beetle skeletonization. Thus, even when negative controls performed in parallel with the same steps conducted on a sample obtained from a museum skull or skeleton yield no PCR product, the sample itself may still be contaminated with human, bacterial, and/or invertebrate DNA. Amplifying short fragments of genes characterized by multiple highly conserved regions, such as 12S, compounds this risk. For example, the popular primers published in Kocher et al. spanning the conserved third domain of the 12S rRNA gene will readily amplify 12S from a wide range of vertebrate taxa , as well as the corresponding region in the homologous 16S rRNA gene in some bacteria . Finally, the ampliWcation of mitochondrial-derived nuclear pseudogenes of 12S from degraded samples was reported by Van der Kuyl et al. . The identiWcation of numts in ribosomal genes can be exceedingly diYcult , making this a particularly problematic issue. Taken together, these concerns warrant very careful examination of resulting sequences, particularly those derived from short ampliWcation products. Towards that end, we propose the following steps for determining whether such sequences are authentic. We emphasize, however, that none of these measures, individually or collectively, is failsafe. In addition to performing standard negative controls during both the extraction and ampliWcation processes , we critically examined each individual sequenced PCR product using the following protocol: Wrst, each sequenced fragment was subjected to an unconstrained BLAST search . The 12S rRNA gene is perhaps the most widely sequenced gene in mammals, with every currently recognized order and most families represented on GenBank. The same is true, to a lesser extent, for several other vertebrate and invertebrate taxa. As such, a simple BLAST search is a logical Wrst step towards checking for contamination. Second, each fragment was compared to all other 12S sequences generated by L.E.O. using Sequencher. Comparisons were made not only to all individual sequenced PCR products, but to all concatenated sequences as well, since diVerent primer pairs were used for diVerent specimens. Finally, the structural model for 12S rRNA proposed by Springer and Douzery was used to check for positional covariation between sites residing on diVerent PCR products normally engaged in canonical pairing, although this by no means guarantees detection of contamination by extraneous DNA or pseudogenes . Sequences were aligned by eye with reference to the secondary structure model of Springer and Douzery . Regions that could not be conWdently aligned were excluded from all analyses, as were partial tRNA sequences at either end of the 12S rRNA gene, since the length of these Xanking sequences varied depending on the ampli-Wcation primers used. Base composition of all taxa was examined to test for signiWcant heterogeneity, which has been shown to aVect phylogenetic inference . We assessed compositional homogeneity across the entire 12S gene as well as within stem and loop regions separately for all individual taxa using a 2 goodness of Wt test. Phylogenetic analyses were performed under both maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood using the software PAUP* 4.0b10 . For MP analyses, all characters were treated as unordered and equally weighted. Tree searches were conducted using the branch-and-bound algorithm, an exact method guaranteed to Wnd all optimal trees. Nodal support was estimated by heuristic bootstrap re-sampling of 1000 pseudoreplicates employing the TBR branch swapping algorithm. Because transitions have been shown to become saturated in mammalian 12S sequences after 20 million years of divergence within loop and, to a lesser extent, stem regions , and because fossil evidence demonstrates that treeshrews originated well before 20 million years ago and bootstrap analyses of transversional changes only . Bremer support values were calculated for select groupings using the \"constraints\" option in PAUP* under otherwise identical search conditions. Uncorrected pairwise distances were calculated for select intertaxon comparisons. For ML tree searches, the best-Wt model of nucleotide substitution was estimated using the successive approximation approach suggested by SwoVord et al. . A single MP tree was used to estimate likelihood model parameters under a nested series of substitution modes using the program Modeltest 3.0 Crandall, 1998, 2001) . Parameter values based on the preferred model according to the likelihood ratio test were then Wxed in a ML search employing 20 heuristic replicates with TBR branch-swapping in PAUP*. The resulting tree was used to re-estimate model parameters, which were Wxed for a second round of tree searches. This process was repeated until a stable topology was obtained. Bootstrap support was evaluated under the Wnal substitution model for 1000 pseudoreplicates using the TBR branch-swapping algorithm on starting trees obtained by stepwise addition. In addition to bootstrap proportions, Bayesian posterior probabilities were estimated to assess nodal support using MrBayes . Mutations at covarying positions violate the fundamental assumption of character independence in phylogenetic analysis . While some authors have recommended down-weighting these sites to adjust for their evolutionary non-independence , others have argued that such positions tend to be conserved and, as such, should be accorded greater weight due to the lower likelihood of parallelisms and reversals . Springer et al. advocated a more integrative approach, showing that simple weighting factors are insuYcient to accommodate the evolutionary complexities of molecules such as 12S. We took advantage of the recently implemented feature in MrBayes that allows for the explicit incorporation of a secondary structural model. To assess the eVect of adding structural interactions to the model, we conducted separate Bayesian analyses with and without speciWcation of the secondary structure model of Springer and Douzery . For both analyses, four MCMC chains were allowed to proceed for 10 million generations, sampling trees every 100 generations. In the Wrst analysis, a model with six categories of base substitution was speciWed, with a gamma-distributed rate parameter and a proportion of invariant sites. In the second analysis, two data partitions were recognized and model parameters for each partition were estimated separately . The same model as in the Wrst analysis was applied to the non-pairing partition. For the pairing partition, the doublet model of nucleotide substitution, which is appropriate for modeling stem regions of ribosomal genes, was speci-Wed. Trees sampled prior to the attainment of stable likelihood values were discarded as burn-in and all subsequently sampled trees in each MCMC run were included in 50% majority-rule consensus trees to obtain posterior probabilities. Separate analyses were conducted using either primates , lagomorphs , or dermopterans to root trees in order to evaluate the eVects of diVerent outgroups on tree topology. None of the negative extraction or PCR controls yielded ampliWcation products for any combination of primers used. When individual sequenced PCR products from the degraded samples were subjected to BLAST searches , all of the sequences longer than 100 nucleotides for Anathana, Tupaia javanica, and T. nicobarica were most similar to one of the four Tupaia 12S sequences on GenBank . The same was true for all fragments >200 bases sequenced for both species of Dendrogale. Most shorter fragments were between 85 and 98% similar to nonscandentian mammals, but this is not surprising given the length of some of these sequences , the numerous conserved regions in the 12S gene, and the expected levels of divergence between Ptilocercus, Dendrogale, and published Tupaia sequences. Most notably, none of the sequences subjected to BLAST searches were 100% similar to any GenBank sequence. The same was true for the comparisons between individual sequenced PCR products and all other sequences generated for this study. Every fragment sequenced in this study was unique. Finally, reference to secondary structure did not suggest chimaeric concatenation of individual fragments within a single reconstructed 12S sequence. While these measures, either individually or collectively, are by no means deWnitive or failsafe, we nonetheless conclude that we have no evidence of contamination from either extraneous DNA or pseudogenes in the sequences generated for this study. Details on the ampliWcation and sequencing strategy employed for all specimens sequenced in this study are provided in Appendix C. The length of the 12S gene in treeshrews ranged from 944 to 960 nucleotides. The alignment to secondary structure with all outgroups included was 1004 bases . Because individual analyses using either primates or lagomorphs as outgroups did not result in diVerent ingroup topologies from those using colugo as the outgroup, only the results of the analyses with colugo as the outgroup will be discussed hereafter. Nucleotide frequencies in treeshrew 12S sequences are very similar to those reported by Springer et al. for mammalian 12S, with adenine as the most abundant nucleotide , followed by cytosine , thymine , and guanine . A similar preponderance of adenine in loop regions was also found. The exclusion of alignment-ambiguous positions resulted in 827 included characters comprising 256 variable positions , 166 of which were parsimony informative. Uncorrected pairwise distances including all changes ranged from 14.6 to 17.5% between Cynocephalus and all treeshrews; 14.4 to 16.2% between Ptilocercus and all tupaiids; 6.7 to 12.6% between both species of Dendrogale and the remaining tupaiids; and 2.3-7.7% among all species of Tupaia as well as Anathana and Urogale. IntraspeciWc divergences ranged between 0.2 and 1.5% in the three species for which sequences were available from multiple individuals . The branch-and-bound search including all changes under the parsimony criterion yielded 66 equally parsi-monious trees of 621 steps. A strict consensus of these with bootstrap support values is shown in Fig. 1 . The TvMP search resulted in only four equally parsimonious trees . None of the TvMP trees was identical to any of the minimal length trees obtained in the MP search, but the same three basal splits were recovered in both analyses . A monophyletic Tupaiidae was recovered in 100% and 99% of the bootstrap replicates, with either slightly or notably lower support for the basal divergence of Dendrogale relative to the remaining tupaiids. Although all MP trees favored Anathana as the sister taxon to a clade containing all Tupaia specimens as well as Urogale, MP bootstrap support for the latter clade was marginal . In contrast, Anathana was recovered as nested within either Tupaia or Tupaia + Urogale in the TvMP analyses, although bootstrap support was low for all interspeciWc groupings in the Fig. 1 . Strict consensus tree representing the 66 most parsimonious trees recovered in the MP branch-and-bound tree search. Numbers above branches represent bootstrap proportions from the MP bootstrap analysis; those below branches represent bootstrap support in the TvMP analysis. The node indicated by an asterisk was not recovered in the latter. Numbers to the right of some species names are used to identify specimens of the same species . SpeciWc epithets are not shown for monotypic treeshrew genera. Tupaia + Anathana + Urogale clade when transversions only were counted. The only noteworthy diVerence between the two parsimony analyses with respect to this clade was the sister relationship between T. splendidula and the three specimens of T. tana, which was recovered in 70% of the TvMP bootstrap replicates but in fewer than 50% of the MP replicates. No other nodes with >70% bootstrap support were recovered in the TvMP analyses that were not recovered with equal or greater support in the MP analyses. However, one clade received 60% bootstrap support in TvMP but was not recovered in any of the optimal MP trees ; this grouping is discussed below with results from the Bayesian analysis. Likelihood analyses converged on a stable topology after a single iteration of the model estimation procedure. The preferred model of nucleotide substitution was equivalent to the TrN model with site-speciWc rate variation approximated by the gamma distribution with a proportion of invariant sites and no molecular clock. The single ML tree with associated ML bootstrap values is shown in Fig. 2 . The same basal relationships ))) were recovered as in the MP analysis, with similarly high bootstrap support for a monophyletic Tupaiidae. Unlike both MP and TvMP, however, a basal divergence of Dendrogale relative to the remaining tupaiids was not recovered in a majority of the bootstrap replicates. Likewise, Anathana was favored as the sister taxon to Tupaia + Urogale but did not receive high bootstrap support. Likelihood scores converged on a stable value before 150,000 generations had elapsed in both Bayesian analyses; the Wrst 200,000 generations were therefore excluded as burn-in. Resulting posterior probabilities are shown on the ML tree in Fig. 2 . Support was similar in both Bayesian analyses for well-supported nodes, suggesting that non-independent positions are not spuriously inXating support for these clades in the analysis that did not incorporate secondary structural interactions. Indeed, diVerences in posterior probability for these nodes did not exceed 0.01. Otherwise, such diVerences were inconsistent, with approximately half of the remaining nodes receiving higher support in one analysis or the other . The only two of these that we consider noteworthy are those uniting Anathana + Tupaia + Urogale and the more nested grouping of T. minor + T. splendidula + T. tana. Both have higher posterior probabilities in the analysis without secondary structure . This is to be expected if a signiWcant number of the mutations that accumulated along each branch leading to these clades occurred in stem regions and were compensated for prior to the subsequent diver-siWcation, thereby increasing perceived support through non-independent changes. This may also explain the strong support for the Anathana + Tupaia + Urogale clade in MP . Only one clade was supported by a high posterior probability that did not receive bootstrap support 770% in MP, TvMP, or ML. This node, indicated by the black square in Fig. 2 , unites six species of Tupaia with posterior probabilities of 1.0 and 0.99 in the analyses with and without secondary structure, respectively. The single ML tree, 8 of the 66 MP trees, and all optimal TvMP trees recovered this clade, but only in the latter did it receive 60% bootstrap support. While some have suggested that Bayesian posterior probabilities inXate nodal support , the recent study by Alfaro et al. found general concordance between support values generated by non-parametric bootstrapping and posterior probabilities. They did, however, identify several scenarios in which strong Bayesian support was found for nodes not supported by high bootstrap values. These include regions of a tree with short internodes and a relatively small number of characters. This may well be the case for the node in question. The majority of the branches in the Tupaia + Urogale clade are relatively short in the ML tree , and of the 166 parsimony informative characters in the complete taxon sample, fewer than half are informative in this group. We therefore provisionally accept this explanation for the disparity in support estimates, as well as the clade itself, though additional data will likely be required to rigorously conWrm it . Monophyly of Tupaiidae was recovered in all phylogenetic analyses with strong support, regardless of the outgroup. This is not surprising in light of the numerous morphological diVerences separating Ptilocercus from all other treeshrews or have not included it . As such, this is the Wrst study to provide phylogenetic support, molecular or otherwise, for the basal divergence of Ptilocercus from the lineage leading to all other living treeshrews. While neither topology nor levels of sequence divergence are appropriate criteria for justifying the familial status of Ptilocercidae, we nonetheless note that the levels of divergence observed between Ptilocercus and Tupaiidae for the 12S gene are on par with those between the two families of primates we included as alternative outgroups and in excess of those observed between the two lagomorph families, Leporidae and Ochotonidae . Collectively, the morphological rejected Lyon's division of treeshrews into two subfamilies based on his interpretation of Dendrogale as either morphologically intermediate between Ptilocercus and Fig. 2 . Single optimal tree recovered in the heuristic ML search. Numbers to the left of nodes represent bootstrap proportions from ML bootstrap analysis followed by Bayesian posterior probabilities without and with the incorporation of the secondary structural model, respectively. Dashes indicate nodes that did not receive >50% bootstrap support or were not resolved in the majority-rule consensus tree from MrBayes. Branch lengths are scaled proportional to the number of substitutions per site, with the exception of the bold branches , which are one-quarter actual length. Numbers to the right of species names are as in Fig. 1 . Species known to occur on Borneo are shown in bold . The node identiWed by the solid square represents conXicting results in ML and Bayesian analyses and is discussed in the text. Tupaiinae or more primitive morphologically than all other treeshrews including Ptilocercus . However, subsequent authors have not endorsed this view . While MP, ML, and Bayesian analyses of the 12S data reported here all strongly support tupaiid monophyly, less consistent support was found for a basal divergence of Dendrogale with respect to the remaining tupaiids. Although this relationship was recovered in all MP trees and the optimal ML tree, as well as in 96% of the MP bootstrap pseudoreplicates, it received less than 50% bootstrap support in the ML analyses. Bayesian posterior probabilities were less than 0.95 in both analyses . Our previous reanalysis of two published morphological datasets supported Dendrogale as the sister taxon to the remaining tupaiids . However, both datasets were rooted with Ptilocercus since neither author had included outgroups in their original dataset. , including questionable assumptions of generic monophyly and diVerences in character conceptualization.) Given the strong support here for tupaiid monophyly, the use of Ptilocercus to root the trees in Olson et al. can now be considered defensible. As such, we consider the morphological data published in Butler and Luckett as supportive of Dendrogale's basal divergence among tupaiids. Taken together with the similar, if moderately well-supported, relationships recovered here, we believe the evidence adduced to date for Dendrogale's phylogenetic position depicted in Figs. 1 and 2 outweighs any evidence to the contrary. We therefore reject Davis' interpretation of Dendrogale as the basal scandentian, as all known evidence supports the proposal that Ptilocercus occupies this position . The generic status of the Indian treeshrew, Anathana, was called into question by Fiedler , who considered it a potential congener of Tupaia. Similarly, Helgen suggested a close relationship between these genera. Our analyses recovered Anathana as the sister taxon to the clade containing Tupaia and Urogale, although neither bootstrap re-sampling nor Bayesian analysis provides strong support for this. In the absence of any conXicting evidence, we tentatively accept the arrangement shown in Figs. 1 and 2 with respect to Anathana. The only other treeshrew species known to occur on mainland southeast Asia north of the Isthmus of Kra are Tupaia belangeri and Dendrogale murina, with the latter known only from southeastern Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam . Based solely on current geographic distributions, it might be expected that Anathana is closely related to T. belangeri, which is known to occur in eastern India and Bhutan . However, a number of characters diVerentiate Anathana from all species in the genus Tupaia . Low support values notwithstanding, our results do not support a close relationship between Anathana and any extant treeshrew, although MP analyses constrained accordingly recover trees in which Anathana is not basal to Tupaia + Urogale at a cost of only two additional steps, with Anathana falling out as either the sister taxon to Urogale or nested within the Urogale + Tupaia clade. The circumstances resulting in Anathana's limited and comparatively isolated distribution remain a mystery for which our results oVer no clear explanation. It is, however, worth noting that fossil treeshrews have been recovered from Miocene deposits of the Siwaliks in India and Pakistan Jacobs, 1980; Sargis, 1999 Sargis, , 2004 . Monophyly of the relatively speciose genus Tupaia has been questioned with respect to both Anathana and Urogale . Dene et al. makes such conclusions tenuous. This same issue applies to the study by Han et al. , who concluded that Urogale may be nested within Tupaia based on morphometry and DNA hybridization. Neither the original cluster analysis of Steele , nor our recent parsimony analysis of his dataset supported a monophyletic Tupaia, with both Urogale and Dendrogale recovered as nested within Tupaia . Although some authors have either implicitly or explicitly assumed monophyly of Tupaia , there seems to be relatively little supportive data . Urogale everetti was originally placed in the genus Tupaia by Thomas in his description of the species. That Thomas, a keen observer of morphological variation in mammals, chose not to recognize this species as a new genus is noteworthy. Mearns inexplicably erected the genus Urogale in his description of U. cylindrura . Lyon's description of Urogale 's morphological distinctiveness remains the most thorough to date, and several characters contrast strikingly with their homologs in other genera, including an elongate rostrum and enlarged second upper incisor. Lyon upheld its generic status and regarded Urogale as more diVerent from Tupaia, Anathana, and Dendrogale than any of these genera are from each other. However, he also opined that Urogale shared a common ancestor with T. tana and T. dorsalis to the exclusion of all other Tupaia species, a hypothesis that has been rejected repeatedly . Our results support neither a T. tana + T. dorsalis clade, nor a sister relationship between Urogale and either of these species. The confusing history of the name Lyonogale Conisbee 1953 was recently reviewed by Olson et al. . In short, Lyon erected the genus Tana to accommodate the species now referred to Tupaia tana and T. dorsalis. Chasen reallocated these taxa to the genus Tupaia, though Ellerman and Morrison-Scott retained Tana as a subgenus comprising these two species. Tana was later renamed Lyonogale by Conisbee , noting the preoccupation of Tana by a Xy. Some subsequent authors have accepted Lyonogale as a valid taxon , while others have rejected it . Dene et al. Perhaps more importantly, both of these species were nested among species of Tupaia, so we reject the recognition of Lyonogale as a separate genus. In addition to the lack of support for Lyonogale, all analyses except MP favored T. splendidula as the sister taxon to T. tana, and this clade was recovered in 16 of the 66 optimal trees in MP analyses . The status of T. splendidula as a distinct species was Wrst questioned by Thomas and Hartert , who identi-Wed one of the two type specimens as a juvenile T. tana, an observation later conWrmed by Hill . Chasen , while recognizing T. splendidula, nonetheless suggested that it was more likely conspeciWc with T. glis. Medway's study, based on additional specimens, conWrmed the morphological distinctiveness of T. splendidula, and subsequent classiWcations have recognized this species . Despite our lack of support for T. splendidula's phylogenetic position, our sample of T. tana bears on this issue. Neither locality nor voucher information were provided for the previously published 12S sequence for T. tana , but the two specimens we sequenced are of known provenance . That the specimen from Sabah consistently falls out in a well-supported clade with the specimen collected from Sumatra rather than with the T. splendidula specimen from Kalimantan is consistent with the continued recognition of T. splendidula as a distinct species, particularly when its poorly supported position is considered. None of the analyses favored a T. splendidula + T. glis relationship. The only other nominal species of Tupaia whose status has been repeatedly questioned and for which our results oVer some illumination is T. palawanensis, the sole treeshrew occurring on the island of Palawan in the Philippines . Corbet and Hill included T. palawanensis in T. glis, as did Nowak . The immunological distance-based analyses of Dene et al. by these authors suggested that T. palawanensis may be the most basal of the Tupaia species they surveyed. Cluster analysis of morphometric data from six species of Tupaia and Urogale likewise failed to support any close similarity between these taxa . Our analyses similarly found no support for a close relationship between T. palawanensis and T. glis. Although neither MP, TvMP, nor ML provided strong support for the position of T. palawanensis, Bayesian posterior probabilities for a clade consisting of several species of Tupaia, including T. palawanensis but not T. glis, were high . Although such inferences are somewhat limited by our sample, we nonetheless conclude that there is no molecular evidence for a close relationship between T. glis and T. palawanensis. Finally, the issue of species limits among T. glis and T. belangeri deserves mention here. No fewer than 54 published names have been synonymized with these two taxa , 27 in each species. A full review of this complicated taxonomic history is well beyond the scope of this paper . Collectively, these species are broadly distributed in southern and SE Asia . As currently recognized, T. belangeri includes all forms north of a purported contact zone between T. belangeri and T. glis in southern Thailand . Tupaia glis includes all forms south of this location. Various authors have considered T. belangeri to be conspeciWc with T. glis , but immunodiVusion data , pelage characters , and cranial morphometry diVerentiate mainland specimens of T. glis from T. belangeri. Additionally, Lyon and Martin noted diVerences in mammary formula between T. belangeri and T. glis . Our reasons for highlighting this example involve methodological issues only. At Wrst glance, our sample would appear to be inadequate to address species limits in T. glis and T. belangeri, given their respective ranges and our relatively small sample sizes. However, we point out that three of these, including two T. belangeri and one T. glis, are of unknown provenance . The only one sequenced for this study, FMNH 165412, was obtained from a zoo, and an exhaustive attempt by one of us to determine the matrilineal origin of this specimen with respect to collecting locality was unsuccessful. The remaining two sequences appeared in publications focused on interordinal mammalian relationships, and no voucher information was provided by their respective authors. The issue of publishing molecular data without the corresponding voucher information is a critical one that has been compellingly addressed in this very journal . While locality information may be relatively unimportant for higher-level questions, studies such as this one making subsequent use of these sequences would beneWt from having such data. For example, if the previously published sequences from T. belangeri and T. glis were derived from specimens south and north, respectively, of the currently recognized contact zone between these species, this would shed additional light on the extent of their distributional overlap . But until journals consistently abide by recommended standards for disclosing voucher information 1136), this problem is almost guaranteed to persist. Treeshrews collectively inhabit one of the most geographically and geologically complex regions of the world . Their distribution west of Wallace's line and their absence on such proximate islands as the Andamans suggests severe limitations to overwater dispersal . Vicariance can therefore almost certainly be assumed to have played a prominent role in the past diversiWcation and resulting distribution of treeshrews. Although the chronology of island formation is reasonably well understood for greater Sundaland , the aforementioned lack of resolution among members of the genera Tupaia and Urogale precludes a rigorous examination of biogeographic patterns at this level with respect to phylogeny. As such, many compelling questions, including the phylogenetic origin of biogeographically enigmatic taxa such as T. nicobarica, T. palawanensis, Anathana, and Urogale, and the possibility of a relatively recent adaptive radiation of treeshrews on Borneo remain unanswered. However, we do take issue with the Wnal conclusion reached by Han et al. , who invoked short genetic distances between Urogale and Tupaia in the context of current geographic distributions in their deduction that Ptilocercus and Dendrogale represent \"mainland outgroups\" to the remaining extant treeshrews. While our analyses support the successively basal divergences of Dendrogale and Ptilocercus, neither of their distributions can be considered more \"mainland\" than those of several other treeshrews . Indeed, D. melanura occurs only in northern Borneo, and Ptilocercus occurs throughout much of Borneo and Sumatra, in addition to peninsular Malaysia and Thailand . We believe that evidence from the distribution of living scandentians is equally supportive of a Bornean origin of treeshrews, given that six of the currently recognized species are restricted to the island and an additional four species occur there, as it is to a \"mainland\" origin .

{"text": "Several supposedly diagnostic caluromyine character states are so ambiguously defined that homology assessment is impossible , others could plausibly be interpreted as primitive marsupial conditions [e.g., \"reduced or absent palatal vacuities\" , some are simply incorrect , and some appear to be misconstrued that the phylogenetic interpretation of these data is equivocal at best. Molecular results supporting the monophyly of Caluromyinae consist solely of the DNA-DNA hybridization data analyzed by Kirsch and Palma . Although neither Patton et al.'s cytochrome b comparisons nor our own data convincingly refute caluromyine monophyly, the absence of any support for this hypothesis in two independent sequencing studies invites alternative interpretations of basal didelphid relationships. In effect, our IRBP analysis securely brackets the phylogenetic position of caluromyines between two highly supported nodes: these taxa are definitely didelphids but they are clearly not didelphines. Because the sister-group relationship of Caluromys and Caluromysiops is not problematic; only the position of Glironia remains uncertain. Although the hypothesis that Glironia is sister to all extant didelphids is marginally better supported than other alternatives tested with our data, convincing phylogenetic resolution in this part of the didelphid tree must await future analyses incorporating data from other slowly evolving genes and from renewed study of morphology. Monophyly of Didelphinae is a noncontroversial result that agrees with the conclusions of previous phylogenetic analyses of morphological data and DNA-DNA hybridization results . Despite this consensus, morphological character support for didelphine monophyly is not impressive. By comparison with caluromyines, didelphines have more carnassialized molars and more extensively fenestrated palates, but neither of these conditions is unique among marsupials and the polarity of metatherian palatal evolution is debatable . Other didelphine synapomorphies potentially recoverable by optimizing morphological characters on most-parsimonious trees have yet to be identified, but our inspection of published data matrices suggests that additional nonmolecular support for this node is more likely to come from new anatomical sources than from the craniodental traits emphasized in past studies. All previous analyses of didelphid phylogeny, morphological and molecular, have supported the monophyly of a group containing the four largest opossums , so our IRBP results simply add to the weight of interdisciplinary evidence for this robust clade. By contrast, two alternative phylogenetic alliances of Metachirus-the fifth large-bodied didelphine genus-have been suggested by researchers using different datasets. Whereas our IRBP results agree with previous molecular analyses in supporting a sistergroup relationship between Metachirus and the other large opossums, Creighton's parsimony analysis of morphological data clustered Metachirus with the small didelphines . A sister-group relationship between Metachirus and the small didelphines was unambiguously supported in Creighton's study by just two characters, a flattened ectotympanic and absence of a pouch. However, both of these traits are variably expressed among nondidelphid polyprotodonts , so their phylogenetic interpretation within Didelphidae is crucially dependent on outgroup choice. Because Creighton's analysis was only rooted with Dromiciops, the robustness of his phylogenetic results to broader outgroup sampling is unknown. Reig et al. subsequently included presence / absence of a pouch in their morphological parsimony analyses, which more often than not suggested a sister-group relationship between Metachirus and the other large opossums. Most other published compilations of potentially relevant nonmolecular character data are uninformative about the relationships of Metachirus. For example, Hershkovitz's diagnosis of Marmosidae consists almost entirely of tautologies , uninterpretable descriptors , and irrelevant plesiomorphies . Similarly, Metachirus exhibits the very widespread 2N 14 karyotype currently thought to be primitive for Marsupialia, whereas all of the other large opossums exhibit the derived diploid count of 22 chromosomes . The only exception to this discouraging absence of relevant nonmolecular data is the recent discovery that Metachirus shares with the other large opossums several attributes of the glans penis that are not found in caluromyines or in any of the small didelphines examined to date . Thus, although the monophyly of a large opossum group that includes Metachirus has not previously been espoused by morphological researchers, neither is it strongly contradicted by any nonmolecular data compiled to date. Instead, at least one recent anatomical study suggests that corroborative evidence from nontraditional character complexes may be forthcoming. A sister-group relationship between Thylamys and Lestodelphys has been supported by most previous phylogenetic analyses of didelphid relationships and is not controversial. By contrast, the phylogenetic configuration suggested by our IRBP results for Gracilinanus and Marmosops with respect to Thylamys + Lestodelphys is unlike any previously suggested in the literature. In particular, the strong support in our data for the nested pattern {[ Gracilinanus] Marmosops} and for the monophyly of Marmosops is at striking odds with Kirsch and Palma's phylogenetic interpretation of their DNA-DNA hybridization experiments .

Both humans and large carnivores were bone modifiers at Lubbock Lake. Wolf was the primary large carnivore through time. Some of the Lubbock Lake bones exhibit a complex life history of both human-induced and carnivore-induced damage. Carnivore damage and disturbance were taken into account and any questionable specimens and damage discounted when analyzing the Lubbock Lake faunal material for game animal determinations, marrow processing, and butchering patterns . The Lubbock Lake faunal remains from all explorations into the Archaic deposits were examined closely in order to determine the role of marrow processing, bone as a material resource, and tool use and production. Isolating the categories of human-induced modifications and identifying specimens within those categories were based on: are very common.

All excavations at Lubbock Lake prior to the LLP were carried out using feet and inches. For this reason, in this paper, linear and depth measurements pertaining to the earlier work at the site are kept in feet and inches. Lubbock Lake Project excavations were conducted in the metric system, and measurements pertaining to that work are given in that system. Measurements on lithic flakes and tools are presented in Table 3 and was carried out using pick and shovel without screening.

These excavations were within 1O-ft squares and within natural stratigraphic levels ranging from 2 to 8 in. thick. Artifacts were plotted according to depth below surface and with reference to the walls of the squares. The LLP excavations were conducted in 1-m squares and 5-cm levels within natural stratigraphic levels using trowels, brushes, and dental tools. All materials found were mapped in place with reference to the main horizontal datum, and elevations were determined using an engineer's level. Horizontal and vertical control was referenced from the same datum .

The WTM, WPA, and LLP excavaton units and TMM stations were located with reference to the same benchmark, although the systems employed were different. The benchmark was assigned differing arbitrary elevations by TMM and WTM work. For LLP excavations, the elevation above sea level for that benchmark was determined.

A large number of the topographic features along the south coast are related to these sea level changes; for instance a wave cut platfonn in the dune rock extending from the Wildemess Lakes to Cape St. Francis or the seven metre high terrace-like feature on which the Sedgefield Village is situated . Miller et al. speculates that even a 2 -3 m rise or fall in sea level would dramatically remodel the coastline; with local variations arising due to tectonism . ulllrinn ell\"\",,! , 3 m • 2 • • 1 , D • -1 \" e -2 ~ \" ~ ~ -4 Since the end of the last glacial period sea level has been on an increase with a 120 m rise towards present day levels, this rise is tenned the Holocene Transgression . Locally, sea level rise allowed for the complete covering of the coastal plain at the beginning of the Holocene , Ramsay speculates that the sea continued to rise by 8mm.yr-l between 9000 and 8000 BP with this initial transgression coming within a metre of present levels by 8000 BP , this trend continued throughout the 7000s BP, reaching a peak of 0 -3 m above mean sea level by 6.8 ka . Sea level fluctuations during this time varied on a regional scale along the South African coast due to isostatic adjustment, ice volume changes and local tectonic movements creating a highly variable sea level curve . A rapid regressive phase about 7000 BP occurred, with sea levels dropping 3 -4 m only to experience a rapid advancement around 6000 BP . This mid-Holocene highstand, which persisted for 2500 years , is said to be of a magnitude of 1.5 m to 3 m above mean sea level . Estuarine shells from the Sundays River suggest an elevation of 1.5 m a.m.s.l. ; however other radiocarbon dated sea level indicators from the south coast suggest a magnitude of between 2.4 m and 2.8 m a.m.s.l. . This is consistent with the 2.5 m terrace on both sides of Swartvlei, an estuary near the town of Sedgefield, which probably fonned as a depositional estuarine terrace . According to Ramsay T o w n higher than present before 5.6 kyr. The higher sea levels are attributed to wanner sea surface temperatures contributing to thermal expansion . Sea level slowly began to drop and reached 0 m a.m.s.l by 4200 BP , with a short lived rise around 4000 BP . Throughout the 3000s BP sea level regressed to within a metre of present datum , by around 3000 BP sea level had dropped to below 2 m a.s.l. with this lowstand maintained until approximately 2000 ka . By 2000 yrs BP sea level has risen again to close to its present level , temporarily rising above present day sea level, indicating a minor recovery from the regression . However, there are suggestions that sea levels began dropping again around l.3 ka and continued to fall until 0.7 ka when it was 0.5 m lower than present . From 0.7 ka the sea has been rising to its present level ; Scott and Lee-Thorp do suggest that sea levels were lower between 0.5 ka and 0.38 ka as an expression of the early phase of the Little Ice Age. As stated by Compton , variations between regional sea level reconstructions arise due to external environment processes, such as isostatic adjustment or tectonic activity, therefore it is rather complex to create one sea level curve for the entire South African coastline. However, the combination of several studies has hinted at generalized sea level fluctuations during the Holocene which are presented in Figure 7 . Lower sea surface temperatures were experienced during the early Holocene, although prior to 7000 BP wanner sea surface temperatures of the adjacent ocean lead to an increase in rainfall possibly under the dominance of westerly circulation , this may have persisted up to and beyond 6.8 kyr, from evidence of marine molluscs from Nelson's Bay Cave , however, by 6300 BP SSTs had lowered . Higher SSTs could be interpreted as intensified Westerly circulation bringing forth their associated frontal disturbances and slightly higher Agulhas Current influence . The timing and duration of two episodes of isotopic enrichment in Antarctic ice cores over the last 4000 years, correspond to periods of Holocene Glacier . The first of which occulTcd betwecn and 2000 yrs BP and relates to a worldwide neo-glacial advancc, thc sccond episode occUlTed between 750 and 400 yrs BP and is an expression of the Little Ice Age which reached a maximum 400 yrs ago . Both episodes are associated with lower annual inshore sea surface temperatures to the magnitude of one to two degrees lower than present day estimates typical of the west coast . A short lived OCCUlTence of low summer and winter SST at around 1000 BP is thought to be an expression of the Mediaeval Warm Period, evidenced through forest decline prior to colonial influence . The Wildemess region has an extensive geomorphic history, relating to changes in various environmental factors, including tectonic defonnation, eustatic fluctuations in sea level and changes in climate and vegetation . The embayment consists of palaeocliffs, a series of lakes and fossil dunes . The palaeocliffs fonn a northem boundary for the Touw River floodplain in which the lakes occur and is bounded along the south by high, consolidated, old sand dunes . The Touw River floodplain is the most important wetland along the south coast and has been designated a RAMSAR site as of 1991 . The Wildemess Lake System consists of several lakes lying in east to west valleys between sand ridges which rise to over 200 m in some places . The lakes, in order from west to east are Eilandvlei, Langvlei, Rondevlei, Swartvlei and Groenvlei , inland from these are the Karatara and Ruigtevlei . None of the lakes are above six metres above mean sea level and are the result of three phases of submergence and emergence, with the last stage occurring during the Holocene . These phases are linked to sea transgressions and regressions, of which the fonnation of the lakes during the Pleistocene was dependant . The present shape of the system fonned in the Early Holocene, with estuarine conditions being established some 4 -5 kyr ago . This developmental phase commenced during the Late Pleistocene and coincided with the marine regression, water levels dropped considerably and in U n i v e r s i t y o f C a p e T o w n e~tl'eme eases lakes emptit'Cl and ~r\"'kd. how~v~[ \"ith the Holo~ene Tmn,gr~\"ion reaching its peak tluring the mid-HoklC~n~. inlerdunlll d~pl,,%inn, were one~ again 110< >d~d . the marjn~ ti dal influenc~ Ia,ted throughoul th~ H ok'cene up to the P\",'~nt Ajrocarpus falemus' illld Crllis rlmmlli!olia . +\" \"'n il' \".

{"text": "and is \" ... calculated by dividing the number of species found in both of two samples The weighted average method assigns each species an optimum and a tolerance for the given environmental variable hence the weighted average optima and tolerances can be used to detennine the desired variable for the study site with weighted average calibration . Weighted Averaging reconstructions take averages twice, once in the regression and once in the calibration, this can result in a deshrinking is required as a correction . This is achieved through the use of a linear ret,'Tession model which regresses the initial infelTed values of the training set on the observed values; this is tenned a classical regression . The classical regression has a tendency to take infelTed values further away from the mean, whereas an inverse ret,'Tession minimizes the root mean squared elTor in the training set . The RMSE gives a measure of the 'apparent' enor ; hence the value of the RMSE evaluates how well a model can be expected to function as a predictive tool . The Jackknife can be used to derive elTors of prediction, where the jackknifed RMSE gives an indication of the \"true predictive ability of a transfer function [and can provide a] realistic predictive cOlTelation and elTor estimate between observed and diatom-infened\" parameters. In this study, Conductivity and pH were reconstructed using the EDDI Combined Salinity training set in the reconstruction software called ERNIE available from the Newcastle University website . The ERNIE program allows diatom-based transfer functions stored in the European diatom database to be applied to core or fossil samples. The dataset is an amalgamation of those established for Spain, North and East Africa and the Caspian region and consists of652 species from 387 lakes. All that is required is to align the diatom species of the core to that of the training set, \"this means that the taxon codes used in the core and training set must match in tenns of the codes themselves and in the taxonomic concepts applied to the codes\" . A weighted averaging reconstruction with inverse deshrinking was chosen for the analysis and was evaluated using jackknifing to detennine diatom species relationships to pH and Conductivity. The analysis of the various methods incorporated and outlined above will provide a framework on which changes in natural processes can be measured. The interpretation of these methods will aid in the understanding of any variations in the diatom community observed over time and lead to inferences on environmental changes. Two dating methods were utilised to create a chronology for the Grocnvlei cores, namely radiocarbon dating and optical luminescence dating. The radiocarbon dates were detennined by the Quaternary Dating Research Unit at the CSIR in Pretoria and were calibrated using the program CaLib Version 5.0 with the calibration dataset SHCa104 for Southern Hemisphere terrestrial samples . Probabilities are ranked to a 95.4% confidence intervaL i.e. 2cr with the relative area under the probability curve calculated and nonnalized to one . The number of calibrated ranges is related to the relative area covered by the probability curve and in cases where more than one range is reported Stuiver ct al. suggests that the extremes of the ranges can be given. Hence, in Table 2 below, the extremes of the lower and upper calibrated range is reported when more than one range is produced as well as the median probability over all ranges. Several sand samples from the Groenvlei cores, GKI and GK2 were extracted for luminescence dating, which was carried out at the Centre for the Environment, Oxford University . Prior to detennining the ages several corrections need to be made, one of which is for dose rate. The environmental dose rate is a measure of the radiation per unit of time since the zeroing of the luminescence clock, which is \"calculated from an analysis of the radioactive elements within the sample and its sunounclings\" ''fII''~; . The introduction of Pillus into the region is known from historical records having occurred during the early stages of the 20 th century and provides an excellent chronological marker . Lower down the cores, two probably short-lived episodes of very rapid sediment deposition occur at depths equating to approximately 4 ka and 8 ka . The most recent episode spans from ~ 830 mm to ~ 330 mm in the GK 2 core and consists of light grey, coarse sand; the horizon of which merges with the root mat dated at around 600 BP. Sediments of the period connecting the sand bar with the formation of peat underwent post depositional erosion, therefore sediments and fossils are thus indistinguishable in age. It can be said that the transition from the ~ 4 ka episode and the root mat having experienced removal of sediment over the 3500 year gap left behind 130 mm of trace material in the GK2 core between the two sedimentary zones . The time between the two rapid deposition events from ~ 4 ka and ~ 8 ka also appears to have been associated with either a depositional hiatus or a continual removal of sediment possibly by wave action over the 4000 year gap, leaving behind approximately 200 mm of trace material in the GK2 core . Mid-Holocene high sea levels may have contributed to the removal of sediment from the GK 2 area as the core site is near the proposed channel connecting Groenvlei to the sea via Swartvlei. Sea levels retumed to present levels around 4200 BP , just prior to the ~ 4 ka event; possibly allowing for 200 years of sequential deposition of sediment before its onset. A new depositional stage occurring between 925 and 830 mm is evident in the stratibTfaphy and may substantiate the 200 year deposition event as pinkish, grey sand with clear laminations are observed; this would suggest that the rate of deposition near the GK 2 site during this stage would be close to 0.5 mm.y.

Cranially the Obregon skull differs from nzearnsi in having smaller teeth and narrower nasals. I have had no specimens of vigilis for comparison, but because the two specimens from southern Soilora agree with the description of that race I do not hesitate to assign them to it. Empalme probably is near the northern limit of the range of vigilis.

I n the original description Allen gave the type locality as \"northern Chihuahua. \" Bailey , in speaking of S. apache, states that the type locality is on the Rio Bavispe in northern Sonora. I n the first volume of his Unknown Mexico Lumholtz tells of his ascent of the Sierra Madre by way of Nacori. His party left Nacori, December 2, 1890, and after crossing two small mountain ranges entered the valley of the Rio Huehuerachi, separated from the upper Bavispe by the highest part of the Sierra Madre at this latitude . After camping at an elevation of four thousand feet, about twenty-three miles from Nacori, they continued on their way toward the crest. On page 36, Lumholtz states : Thus we advanced for about six miles and made camp, a t an elevation of 6,300 feet, on some old trencheras, with a fine view over the vast country me had left below. Large Boelrs of gray pigeons of remarkable size squatted on the pine trees near by, and two specinlens of the gigantic woodpeclrer were here observed for the first time.

At TQsia they were common along the second bottom of the river and in cultivated fields, where they were trapped in colonies of cotton rats . The food of the spiny pocket mice at this locality consisted chiefly of seeds of cultivated beans and wheat. At Guirocoba the animals were fairly common along the edges of cultivated fields. The previously known northern record for the genus Liomys was Camoa, Sonora . The taking of a specimen at Ures extends the range not only of the species but also of the genus north to this point, which is very probably near the northern limit of its range. Liomys might be expected to occur on northward for a short distance along the Rio Sonora. There is relatively little variation throughout the range of the species in the state.

Baiomys taylori paulus Baioniys Pevo~r~yscus paulus Allon, Bull. Amer. Mus. Nut. Hist., 19 REMARKS.-~~'O~~ specimens of Baiomys, two adult females and two immature males, were talcen at Obregon, November 6 to 20, 1929. They were caught on land which was being irrigated and were apparently rare at this, the only locality at which they were talcen. Forty-two trap nights in a restricted area produced four specimens. Rolled oats were of no use as bait; all four were taken at traps baited with bacon or cheese. An adult female, DRD., No. 16928, collected November 20,1929 , was suckling young. These records from Sonora extend the known range of the species from , southern Sinaloa on the south and from central Chihuahua on the east. I t is with much reluctance that I place the Sonora specimens in the subspecies pazclsu, partially because there is a mountain barrier between Sonora and central Chihuahua and Durango. It is possible, however, that they occur along the coast of Sinaloa and thence northward into Sonora. I n addition to the relatively remote geographic position of the Sonora locality there are certain skin and skull characters which lead me to suspect that a distinct race occurs in Sonora. Because there are only four specimens from the state, it seems best to refrain from adding another doubtful name to the list. I n a comparison of Sonoran specimens with a topotypical series of paulus, kindly loaned by the staff of the American Musenin of Natural History, I find that in size there is little difference, the Sonoran series averaging slightly larger; the coloration of this series is more grayish brown ; however, the series of paulus at hand was collected in 1903, and it is possible that the color has faded slightly in thirty years. The skulls of the Sonoran specimens are flatter, less convex, anteroposteriorly ; the interparietal is more 55 nearly oval, with the transverse diameter relatively less and the anteroposterior diameter relatively greater ; the lateral portions of the interparietal do not taper out to a point as they do in specimens of paulzu from Durango; the suture between the frontals and the parietals is shaped somewhat differently in the two groups. Were a series of speciinens available the above characters might lose their significance. Further collecting in the state is necessary before definite statements can be made concerning the systematic status of Baiontys there.

Type from Sonoyta, Sonora. DISTRIBUTION.-With local variations, ranges throughout most of northwestern Sonora, except the Pinacate region, from as far east as Providencia mines, south and west to I3ermosill0, intergracling with anthonyi at Guaymas . Recorded from Cerro Blanco, Pozo de Luis, Providencia mines, Quitobaquita, and Sonoyta ; and Hermosillo, Costa Rica ranch, Sargent's Point, and Alamo Wash . R~~~n~s . -H e r m o s i l l o specimens are not typical erenzicus, but according to available examples they are iiearer that race than they are to anthonyi from southern Sonora. Osgood considered specimens from Hermosillo and Magdalena as anthonyi. Curiously enough Osgood's distribntional map does not agree with his text in regard to erenzicus in Sonora. H e reports this race from Cerro Elanco and Providencia mines, both well within the range of anthonyi as given on his distributional map. Specimens from Alamo Wash vary somewhat from the others in larger size and darker coloration, otherwise they are similar. Blossom assumed specimens from Hermosillo to be typical anthonyi, and on this basis considered those from the vicinity of Tucson, Arizona, to be unthonyi. I agree with Blossom that the Hermosillo and Tncson specimens are the same, but I cannot agree with him in calling them anthonyi. With ample series of anthonyi from southern Sonora, where this race displays its characters in undiluted form, i t is at once evident that I-Iermosillo and Tucson specimens are nearer to erenzicus than to anthonyi as these races are now known. If, of this variable species, a name were to be given to each series that shows a slight difference in color tone from series from adjoining localities there would be no less than six races in the state. I t is well, I believe, to point out these local variations, but to name all of them would be likely to lead only to confusion and would defeat the purpose of taxonomy.

R E M A R K S . --T~~~~ is much size variation in the specimens at hand. Those from Guirocoba average smaller than those from T6sia, Obregon, Chinobampo, San Javier, Tecoripa, and Ures. Specimens from near Guaymas, here considered as intergrades, are again slightly smaller. I t is strange that, although much collecting has been done recently in the Alamos district and large series of Peroinysczcs have been obtained, no further specimens of goldmani as defined by Osgood have come to light. I have examined the type, w'hich is an extremely old female with badly worn teeth. The large hilid foot measurement which Osgood gave as one of the characters, I believe to be an error. This is the field measurement given on the tag. By carefully measuring the clry feet I found that the left hind foot measured 21.5 and the right foot 21.6 mm. One would not expect 2.5 mm. shrinkage. A specimen which Osgood called antkonyi measured, hind foot dry, 22.2 mm. . The coloration of the type is slightly less grayish than specimens of antlzorayi, but this might be no more than normal variation to be expected in the race. REMARKS.-T~~S species was found to inhabit chiefly the areas where there were outcroppings of rocks along the sides of small canyons. Osgood considered specimens from the adjoining mainland to be tiburonensis; however, a series of specimens from Sargent's Point, directly opposite Tibur6n Island are, to me, distinct from the island representatives.

{"text": "As an alternative hypotliesis to that of \" homing instinct ' ' the f ollowi~lg explanation might bear examination : that chance wnndrring combi~led with a high activity serves to brlng the animal into an area of fairly large size wit11 which it is familiar. The Mmics have some evideizce that the dispersion from place of 'elease is chiefly in one clirection-homeward. A n experiment to determine whether or not Peromysczcs lezccopzis possesses a homing instinct was carried out in the following manner: A quadrat 300 yards long and eighty yards vide was selected along one side of a n extensive wood lot. Live traps were set in a grid pattern, about sixtee11 yards apart, tllronghout the area. All traps remained set for four nights, August 5-8, 1937, and each of the nlicc t'augllt on the first three nights, as soon as i t was first discovered in a trap, was carried to the center of tlie plot and released . When they mere talteii from the traps they were marlred and plaectl in a metal bncl~et wit11 a tight lid, and could not see where they were being carried. Many of them were transpoi-ted across the length of the q r~a d r a t several timcs before they eventually were released. The distances from the points of capture to the point of release ranged from ten to 155 yards. Iilasmach as the average normal range of a n iiidiviclual is rarely more than seventy-five yards in greatest cliametcr, the mice from areas ~liore than thrcc trap lines away from the center may be considered as having bee11 carried ont of their territories. The possibility of any one animal's knowing the entire area may be ruled out, I believe, because apparently the woocl nzonse rarely goes ally great distance olzcc i t has established a home. Young animals i11 their search for a lronle constitute a n exception. If there were no homit~g sense-no directing force-we sholxld expect the mice to disperse equally in all directioizs from the point of release. The experiment inay be summarized as follows : Thirty-seven mice from throughout the area were released in the center of the quadrat. These were made up of the following categories : old males, thirteen ; old females, ~iilie ; young mature males of the year, ten ; young mature females of the year, four ; young immature female, one. All of these mice except one young female were old enough to have established their homes, although, as miill be pointed out later, some of them probably were still wandering in search of homes. If the mouse were recaptured not more than two traps distant from the point where it was originally taken, I considered it to have returned home; otherwise, it was colisidered to be lost or wandering. Twenty-eight iiidividuals, or 76 per cent of the mice, returned home. Thirteen of these were recaptured in the same traps in which they were talien originally . Two went ill a direction almost exactly opposite to the direction of home. One of these came back nearly to the point of release on the second night. Ailother on the way to its home, which was 150 yards from tlie point of release, was stopped by a trap when it had golie but half that distance. One was tal~eii near the point of release and was in its home territory. One entered a trap near the point of release, and another welit i11 the homeward direction, but beyond the place of initial capture, and then, on the second night, returned about 160 yards and uTas caught slightly beyond tlie point of release and in the direction opposite from the point where it was first talcen. Since this mouse, a young adult male, had been marked in another wood lot less than two weelrs prior to being captured here, it was probably a wanderer ~vhich had no established home to which to return. This explanation may account for the action of some of the others that did not return to the place of capture. Three of the animals were not retaken . The distances traveled by those that returned home are given in Table VII . Of these, nineteen returned the first night after release, five were talren on the secolid night, and four 011 the third. A week after this experiment I trapped the same quadrat again for two nights, August 16-17, 1937. All of the mice that had returned to their homes, represented in Figure 5 A, were caught again, and all but one were still in the same territories. This one, a young adult male, had moved 145 yards toward the southeast corner of the quadrat. Of those represented in Figure 5 B, only one was talien. This mouse, as has been pointed out , originally had been caught near the center of the quadrat, and the point of release was, no doubt, within his territory. As a further check on the homing instinct hypothesis, another area was selected and the experiment was repeated. I n this experiment, however, many of the animals were carried considerably farther from their homes. Otherwise, the details of the experiment were the same as those outlined for the first area. The second area, somewhat irregular in outline, was 350 yards in greatest length. Throughout slightly more than half its length it mas 125 yards wide, the remainder being but forty yards in width . This wood lot is surrounded by open fields, except at the narrow end, which continues as a strip of woods. All animals caught in the narrow strip were carried to the southeast corner and released ; those caught in the broader east section of the area were carried to the west end and released . The greatest distance that an animal was moved in a straight line was 365 yards, and the shortest distance, 160 yards. Thus, the shortest distance that mice were moved was about three times the diameter of the normal range of an individual. Traps were set August 20-23 and against August 31-September 3, 1937. Fifty-one mice, all but four being adults, were involved in this experiment. Thirty-two were carried from the east section and released at the west end; nineteen were carried from the west section of the plot and released at the southeast corner. Six of the nineteen released a t the southeast corner returned home; the distances which they covered in returning were 270, 300, 300, 335, 360, and 365 yards, respectively. Eight started in the general direction of home and reached distances from the point of release of 40 to 110 yards. Five were not recaught. Of those released at the west end, thirty-two in all, eleven returned home from distaizces of 175, 175, 175, 185, 200, 210, 215, 240, 255, 300 , and 355 yards, respectively. Nine started in the general direction of home and reached distances of ninety yards or less. One remained at the point of release, and eleven were not retaken. The experiment in this plot may be summarized as follows : Fifty-one mice were moved distances of 160 to 365 yards. Seventeen mice, 334 per cent of those moved, returned to their homes over distances of 175 to 365 yards . Seventeen, 334 per cent, started in the proper clirection and traveled 110 yards or less, but did not reach home. One, 2 per cent, stayed a t the point of release, and sixteen, 313 per cent, m7ere not talren again. Mice released a t the southeast corner were forced to start in the direction of home if they remained in the wooded area, as this corner was bordered by grasslancl. Those released a t the west end had continuous woods in every direction. This may account for the higher percentage of directional movement towards home among mice released at the southeast corner than among those released at the west end . The grassland, however, is not a barrier to these mice. It will be noted that in the first experiment, in which Inice were carried ten to 155 yards and released , 76 per cent returned to their homes, bat that i11 the second experiment, in which they were carried 160 to 365 yards , 33; per cent returned to their homes. The snlaller pereentage of returns seems to be correlated with the greater distances that the mice were movcd. This, it seems to me, indicates that members of this species possess a homing sense of some nature. Random ~vanclering would not account for the return of such a large proportion of the animals to the place of first capture, nor for the return of many to the same trap. Dispersal of individuals in this species occurs chiefly while the animals are youlig and before they have established their homes. Once an animal selects a home site it rarely leaves, but usually remains there for the rest of its life. I have records of 287 animals that were take11 bet-cveen two weeks and a year after their initial capture. The distances between the points of initial capture and the points of subsequent captures are shown in Table IX . If animals remained within 100 yards of the place of original capture they were considered not to have dispersed. I t will be noted that of fifty-six old females only three moved appreciable distances from the points of initial capture, two moved between 200 and 300 yards, and one between 700 aucl 800 yards. Old males move greater distances than do old females but young males and females move farther than do old males. The animals that nioved farthest were young. It is quite probable that a number of these animals llad moved some distance before they were caught the first time, and some ~~sidoubtedly continued to move after the last capture. My records, tlierelore, clo not iiecessarily indicate n~asiliium distances traveled. They do, however, give some indication of the ciistances dispersed. The records show that about one-third of the young iiioved distances of 100 to 900 yards from the place of initial capture, and that two-thirds remained fairly close to the place where first taken. ?'he average distance nioved by the Ety-one young aiiinials is 266 yards. POPULATIONS~ I 1 1 an attempt to determine populations of Peronzyscus in central New York, Townsend used a stationary line of traps about one Imntlred feet long, and, \"several yards away, ' ' a moving quadrat t.onsisting of three lines of traps, the lines being a rod apart and each line thirty-three feet long. After each night of trapping, the liuc nearest the starting base was picked u p and moved a rod ahead of the foremost line; tlxns tlre lines were advanced through the quadrat. The traps were set and changed in this fashion for fourteen clays, after which time all were nioved to another area. The moving qnadrat and stationary line covered seve~iteen-eightieths of an acre. 1 1 1 the stationary linc, only tlie catch of the first tlirce nights mas counted in his population estimates. Because his quadrat vlas only tliirtythree feet wide by 264 fcct long, and bccanse an individual mouse, nol.mally ranges over an area of 150 to 300 feet in diameter, it is apparent that Townsencl was using his traps not only for animals wliicll ranged wliolly within the quadrat bat also for those which ranged in part outside the quadrat. I11 calculating the population per acre, as I understanil his experiment, Townsend considered the area covered by his traps, plus a strip one-half rod wide at each end-a total area of about seventeen-eightieths of an acre. He should have included a strip no less than 125 feet wide all around his quadrat, provided the quadrat was well inside the habitat and not on one of its borders. Calculating his area in this way one would expect him to trap out two to three acres instead of seventeen-eightieths of an acre. His population estimates, are, therefore, possibly from ten to fifteen times greater than the actual population. It is impossible from the data Townsend presents to calculate the number of mice per acre. He does not give the distance between the stationary line and the moving quadrat, nor does he state whether his traps were near the border of the woocls or well within it. Furthermore, i t is essential to know the exact dates, because of the fluctuation in numbers from month to month. Suffice it to state that his estimates certainly were too high and were subject to a rather large error. Williams used a still smaller quadrat than did Townsend, and his error in estimating populations is, therefore, still greater. He, however, realized his error before the end of his stuclies, and stated that his estimates were undoubtedly too high. Inasmuch as his quadrat and his total catch were both so small, the resultant error is great enough so that his data cannot be considered of any significance for a proper estimate of the actual numbers of animals. If his table of total catches is studied one finds that in Quadrat A, for instance, he caught eight mice in 1932, one in 1933, none in 1934, and three in 1935. One may account for these cliff crences in numbers in the following manner : Suppose, in 1932, that his quadrat were over a home where a litter of young mice were ready to leave the nest. If he caught this family and also one or two individaals that wandered in from the outside he would have his maximum population. His low catch in 1933 and 1934 may be explained: by depletion of the population by a predator, and by trapping in an unoccupied area. Williams estimated that in the autumn of 1932 there were 218.52 wood mice per acre. This would be one mouse for every area fourteen feet square. His total of all mammals per acre, which he estimates a t 529.25, is one animal for each area seven feet square-a veritable plague ! I n order to determine the population of unit areas for a given species, i t is essential first to select an area larger than the nornial range of an individual of that species. The larger the area, the less will be the error. Townsend's quadrats covered, in length, a strip that would be covered by one animal, but in width they were much less. The quadrats used by Williams were about one-sixth the area covered by a single animal. Another source of error in the findings of both these men is the use of snap traps. When a mouse is removed from a n area, its territory is made vacant and beconies available to anotlier animal. I n my population studies live traps were used; the only animals talteii off the areas were those that died in the traps. Many were lost in this way a t the begiilliing of the first season, but during the last t~v o seasons, after the trapping technique had been iniproved, very few mice died in the traps. The teclinique which I employed is 11ot perfect, but I believe it gives a fairly reliable index to the population of Perontyscus per unit area. Three fairly isolated wood lots were selected on the George Reserve, covering 1.8, 3.72, and 24 acres respectively. Live traps were set in grid patter11 every tell paces apart in the plot of 1.8 acres; iii the plot of 3.72 acres, the traps were set twenty paces apart with the lines tell paces a p a r t ; and in the twenty-four-acre plot the traps were placed twenty paces apart in lines, wliich also were twenty paces apart. All traps were liunibered and left in the same positions throaghout the trapping period. The positions of the traps were plotted on a map of the area. Every animal caught was marked ant1 was released a t the point of capture as soon as its number, age, and sex, aiid other inforrnatio~z concerning it, as well as the number of the t r a p and the date, llacl been recorded. Recaptured animals were recorded and released after external examination. The method of live-trapping and marlting animals to detcrmine populations was first suggested by Dice in 1931 . I T it be assumed that all the animals in the area were caught this method should give a fairly acenrate count of the population a t any given period of a week. The results from the three areas, with traps spaced clifferently i n each area, were about tlic same. Tllc only advantage in placing the traps close to one another is that a11 the aniliials i11 an area may be caught in a shorter time. I believe the niost practical clistaiice between traps for the areas studied is about forty-five feet. Traps so spaced should catch the animals in the area i n five nights. I n orcler to detcrmine the population in a large tract i n wllicll it is inipossible to t r a p all the aiiillials of the species, I s~lggest that one select a quadrat of two to five acres aiid set traps in this for a t least five nights. If the habitat is uniform beyond the outside line of traps, the area from which the animals come will be not only that in which the traps are set, but will include a n additional strip abont 125 feet wide along the borders. This is about one-half the mean wiclth of the home ranges of niales a n d females combiaecl. The area thus computed should be that covered by the traps plus 125 feet of border to include marginal animals the ranges of which are partly within and partly outside the trapped area . Individual mice range over an area 150 feet to 300 feet i n diameter, depending on whether they are females or males. During the three seasons in which the populations of Peromyscus have beell followed , there has been little fluctuation in numbers from year to year. There is, however, a considerable differelice in the population from month to month within any one year. I t should be stressed here that in making ally population count it is important that the season ill which the count is made be considered. I n Plots 1 and 2 combined, from June, 1936 , to June, 1937 , the population varied from 10.87 per acre in November to 3.08 per acre in May . I n Plot 1 alone, the population was 12.6 per acre in November, 1936. The population curve throughout the year reflects the breeding activities of the animals. It is lowest in May before the first young are abroad. When the first young appear the curve goes up rapidly until about the latter part of June or early Jnly. It then slowly descends, but not to the low point of the month of May. Again in August young come out of the nest, and the curve rises to a poiiit higher than it reached in June. There is then a slight decline in September, but when the young of the spring females also appear, it goes up rapidly to the highest peak of the year i11 October aiid November. With the breeding season ended, the curve descends gradually until the lowest point of t,he year is again reached the follov~ing May. My figures, it will be noted, are much lower than those given either by To~vasend or Williams. The population in any area is never static. Old I-esideiits are disappearing and new ones are coming on the scene continually . During the twelve months, June , , through May, 1937 , eighty-seven aninials were trapped oil an area of 3.72 acres. The greatest number taken a t any one time was forty-seven in November, 1936, and the smallest was thii-teen in May, 1937. The grand total of eighty-seven probably does not represent the actual number of animals that passed through the area, as some transients undoubtedly went t11roug.h during peri- ods when tlie traps were not set. A few of the animals that disappear from an area may be captured later in other near-by areas, but most of them never are seen again. Preclators are undoubtedly responsible for the majority that disappear. The records just cited support the coiiclusioii that of every eight ailinials which appear in a given area within a ycar's time, one will survive to propagate the race. As has bee11 pointed out, one pair will produce, on the average, about sixteen young dnring the breeding season. To maintain a population, then, the survival of one i11 eight a t the end of a year is all that is necessary, and this seems to be what actually happens if my trapping data are reliable. Most mice of this species probably are eliminated by predators or die from sonlc other cause before they rcaeh the age of one year. A few continue to live for a year, and an occasional indiviclual may reach the ripe old age of two years or more. The oldest mouse of which I have a record was nearly two years old in July, 1937. She was taliell first on November 9, 1935, a t which time she was about a month old. Since then she has remained in the same locality. A nearly complete replacement of animals from year to year indicates that relatively few reach the age of one year. I n August, 1936, twenty-six animals were marked in one wood lot. A year later, August, 1937, when the same area was trapped, only one mouse that had been there the previous year remained. MORTALITY I t is likely that few, if any, of these mice ever die of old age. In three instances, two in the winter and one in June, I found carcasses of these mice. Neither of the two found in winter showed evidence of injury from another animal; however, they had been dead for some time, and i t is possible that evidence of injnries sustained previous to death mrould not have been apparent by the time they mere found. Both were less than one year old slid surely could not have died of senility. The third, a young female, was found dead June 17, 193'5. ", "meta": {"ref_id": "MP045.json"}}

{"text": "Deer have been lrnown to remain \"in certain areas when there appears to be more and better food only a short distance away, and easily accessible77 , and yet they will not move out. We have very little definite data on the actual sizes of territories or home ranges of individuals of any species of mammal. The wolf is said to have a hunting range several miles long, and the mountain lion is likewise supposed to range over a considerable area. These large predators might travel easily a distance of ten or more miles in a night, and they probably do, if food is scarce. Until we have more definite information on the travels of the larger animals i t is best to refrain from a discussion of their hypothetical ranges. We have definite information on the size of home range of sollie of the smaller mammals. These data may be secured i11 two ways: by direct observations of diurnal species, atid by livc-trapping, marking, and releasing. We know that the female Mohave ground squirrel will cover an area in one day with the greatest diameter of a t least 130 yards, over three acres . Breeding females of Peromyscus lencopus noveboracensis will range over an area of one-half acre or less, while old males may cover as much as one and one-half acres, although usually they range over less than an acre. The pine mouse probably is confined to a smaller area. Our records are scanty on this species, but we do know that some individuals cover areas a t least 100 feet in greatest diameter . Microtus pennsylvanicus, according to Hamilton , will range over about 0.2 acres. Synaptomys eooperi will range over an area about 120 feet in diameter , and the shorttailed shrew over an area a t least 100 feet across . The female eastern chipmunk ranges over an area of about one acre. Blair has found that the Florida marsh rabbit ranges within a n area no more than 100 yards across, and Lay and Baker indicate that the home range of Neotoma florzdana attwaleri is only about eighty feet in diameter. I t has been shown that the size of the home range varies greatly according to species, and, within certain species, according to sex. The size of the territory within the home range becomes important in limiting the population in an area. -The wood mouse is an example: A breeding female, in typical woodland habitat in southern Michigan, must have for her own an area of at least one-fourth of an acre. This means that there can be no more than four breeding females per acre . If the sexes are about equal in numbers-and from our data they seem to be-the population of this species is not more than eight per acre a t the beginning of the breeding season in early March. Actually, I have found the areas about half filled, or with less than four mice per acre, in the spring. The beginning of the breeding season is the critical period in the population of any species, as this is the time when it is smallest. The population may swell during the summer months and reach its peak in late autumn after the last litters are born, when the maximum is ten or twelve mice per acre. By the beginning of the next breeding season the females that weathered the winter must locate nesting sites and SMALL MAMMALS I N SOUTHERN MICHIGAN 55 establish their territories to begin a new cycle of breeding activity. I t is at this period that territorial behavior influences the new generation of mice to be brought forth. Only those females that can find suitable nesting sites will be successful in rearing young. One animal does not necessarily retain the same territory for life, nor do females always stay in the same area throughout the breeding season. There are very few data on the retention of territory, and my remarks must therefore be based almost exclusively on my own work. Some breeding females of the wood mouse have been known to hold their territories throughout the entire breeding season and to remain in the same area throughout the following winter, while others have been known to move away. The breeding season of these mice is divided into two periods. The first lasts from about the first week in March until early June. There is then a rest period of about six weeks to two months, during which time no young are born. The second period begins in July and continues until about October. Thus the entire season lasts about eight, months, with a rest period of nearly two months in the middle. It is during this rest period that some of the females change territories ; others, however, remain in the same area throughout the eight months. If an area is vacated by an old female, either another old female or a young female born that year is likely to move in. Just how a selection is made I do not know, but it is probable that a young mouse keeps traveling until it finds an unoccupied territory. When first out of the nest the young wander a great deal, but about the time they become sexually mature they settle in one place and reside there during the remainder of the season. Selection, therefore, seems to depend on the finding of suitable shelter and food conditions. The period from the time the mouse leaves the nest, a t about twenty-one days old, until it finds a territory not occupied by another, is probably the most hazardous part of the animal's life. During this time it is exploring. I t must travel over much unfamiliar ground; its chance of escape if approached by a predator is marlredly less than that of a mouse familiar with all the retreats. The greatest mortality apparently occurs in the searching stage. Partially to compensate for such a loss and to make the first few days that the young are out of the nest less perilous, the old female sometimes vacates the home nest and leaves it to the young. I have observed a female chipmunk do this, and our trapping records of Peromyscus indicate that they, too, may display the trait, especially with the last litter of the breeding period. When an old female vacates the nest site she does not necessarily move any great distance, but merely finds a new retreat within her original territory. This gives the young a chance to become able to care for themselves before they are driven into new surroundings. When the population of an area becomes so great that there is not room for all the individuals-that is, that there are not enough available territories-some of the individuals are forced out. Under normal conditions those that are established may be expected to defend their respective areas. Young individuals without homes are driven from place to place until they leave the area and seek new homes elsewhere. A reasoilable conclusion would be that they leave by force rather than by choice-that they are literally ejected from the area by the older, stronger individuals. This pressure from within the range of a species, this conflict for nesting sites and territories that keeps a certain percentage of the population moving, pushing in all directions, coming into contact with one another and with established individuals only to be driven on and into new areas, is important in the spread of a species. Territorial behavior is important in limiting the populations in an area. I t is influential in causing young animals to cross unsuitable habitats and barriers, thereby bringing about the dispersal of animals over a geographic area. The dispersal of young from the nest site to some extent prevents inbreeding in a population. 100.0 July .......... .......... J First lialf .... Second half ..

HOOPER some detail by Dale COMPARISONS.-The race gold?nani is smaller and darlier than the race tularensis, the terminal tail hairs are shortcr , the black tail stripes are more than twice the width of the white tail stripes, and the ear is slightly larger. D. 72. goldmana is more distinct from californiczcs than i t is from fularensis. I t is smaller and paler ; the tail is shortcr, much more scantily haired, and dark distally; five toes are present on the hind foot; tlle skull is relatively narrower across the temporal bullae, and the nasals are relatively shorter. REMARK^.-^'^^ range of goldmani probably complements that of venzutzu: goldmani lives around the edges of valleys and on the adjoining lower slopes, whereas venzut~is occupics higher, coolcr slopes and crests of ridges.

The specimens available to Howell supplied but slight evidence of intergradation between the two forms, get apparently the evidence was sufficieiit to indicate that more complete iatergradation could be expected in specimeiis from areas geographically betweeii the currently lmowii ranges of those forms. Accordingly, he considered them to be conspecific. Grinnell recognized each as a full species, because intergradation betweeii the Sorms liacl not been demonstrated. Scvcral spccinieiis at hand are intermediate between speci~iieils of raviventris and llalicoctes i11 the diagnostic chai-actcrs of these forins; they are accordingly treated as subspecies. All but four of the twenty-four specimens of lralicoetes from the l'etaluma marslies, Sonoina Co~mty, are more or less suffused ventrally ~itith the rccldish orange of ravizlc?ztr~..~; some also llave the short tail and broad zygoiiiata of thc latter race. A specimen from the Corte Madera m a r s h~s , M a r i~i Comlty, otherwise \"average\" ravivc?ztris, has the large white chin aiid throat area and long tail of kalicoetes. Others from these marshes are variously between the t~v o forms in cliaracters of skin and sknll. REMAI~KS -One hundred and forty-six speciinells were examineti. Specimens from the vicinity of Berkeley, Alanieda Couaty, differ from topotypes of parasiticzcs and benitoensis allnost as much as the topotypical series of each of these two races clo from each other. Compared with them, Berlreley specimens lrave a longer slrull , longer hard palate, and shorter incisive foramina. Their coloration is llilrch as in topotypes of parasiticzcs, but darker gray dorsally . The cinnamoiicolored pectoral patch is smaller, and the tail is sharply bicolor. Specimens from the viciiiity of Mount Hamilton, Saiita Clara Coui~ty, are intermediate in characters of slrin and skull betweeii topotypes of Dcniioelzsis and parasitic?rs, but are nearer be?zitoelzsis in all characters except size of auditory bullae. COMPARISONS.-A stud)-of the more complete material now available, obtained since Griilnell and Orr reviewed the species Perowzysczu californicz~s, reveals that the following differences distinguish benitoensis from parasitzcz~s: paler coloration, with less veiltral pigmentation ; shorter tail . Confined to the California faunal area. I-IABITAT.-G~~u~~ provided with cover, whether that cover be ledges of' rock, grass, chaparral, or forest , but not caxtremely wet areas or areas subject to freyaeiit illnilclatio~l, as those covered with Salicornia or other marsh plants. REMARKS.-Ninety-three specimens were examined. P. m. gantbelii grades into P. m. rubid7c.s along the periphery of the coastal fog belt. In and longer brain case ; longer rostrum; and longer incisive foramina . REM~n1~s.-One hundred and eighty-eight specimens were examined. The range of racbidau conforms, in general, to the clistribution of the redwoocl-Douglas fir association. Factors controlling the distribution of this association niay also inflnence the distribution of the large size, long tail, dark reddish coloration, ancl other characteristics of r z~b i d z~s .

Hn~~~~r.--Brushy or wooded areas or boulders , not open grasslands, dense forests, pure stands of high-growing chainise, or marshlancls; ground that is cornpar-atively clry, not subject to iilundatioils; soil that the animal can dig into for rrfnges, or rocky situations s~~i t a b l r for refuges. REMARICS.-TWO hundred and forty-one specimens were examined. Specimelis from San Mateo County and western Santa Clara County are slightly different from specimens collected farther illland . They average larger and darlter, aiicl the auditory bullae are more inflatecl. Certain trends ill variation observed iu other rodents inhabiting the coastal region of California, in Pcronayscz~s n t a n r c~~l a t z~s and N e o t o m a c i n c~e a , for exan~ple, also may be sceil in P~r o m y s c z c s t r u e i . These trends are toward development ol a darlrer color and a longer tail in humid areas near tlie seacoast.

Specimeils from certain localities in the fog belt south of the bay, on the periphery of the fog belt, or in humid islands inland are variously between gslDer.ii and sequoienszs in characters. This is true, for example, ol' specimeils from near Calistoga, Napa County, from Berkeley, Alameda County, aiid from several localities i11 San Mateo and western Santa Clara counties.

Epiphytes, mosses, and ferns were found near the top of the mountain. Lower down, most of the original forests had been cleared and much of it converted to coffee with smaller plantations ol bananas and some patches of corn. Grassy areas, mostly near the small streams, were not extensive. Some of the rocky slopes supported thick growths ol brushy plants. In the grassy areas were such rodents as Oryzomys, Signzodon, Baiomys, Liomys, and Reithrodontomys. Oryzomys was found also along the streams with Rheomys. On the rocky canyon slopes, near the bottom, were Heteromys, Ototylonzys, Peromyscus, and Cryptotis; Potos, Sci~~rzls, and Coendou were fairly confined to the oak iorest. Otllers that ranged widely were Llidelphis, Felis, Urocyon, Conepatus, Dasypz~s, Dasyprocta, Agoziti, and Sylvilagus. Pocket gophers were taken on the north slope.

There were no oaks. Below this, down to an elevation of about 2000 it., much of the underbrush had been cleared and the land planted to coffee. Mammal collecting was in the pines, grassland, and coffee forest. There were also patches of thick brush and the slopes were strewn with lava boulders. Peromyscus mexicanus occupied chiefly the coffee areas with Ototylomys and Sciul-us; Peromyscus stirtoni preferred grasslands along with Sigrnodon. ; collected bats April 7, 1926. PUERTO DEL TRIUNFO, Dept. Usulutin: 130 16' N, 8S0 32' W; collected December 28, 1925 -January 25, 1926 This was an old deserted seaport on the north side of Triunfo Bay. Mangrove thickets border the open channels. East of the village was an extensive jungle forest with an understory of huiscoyol palm. Threading through this jungle were nunerous small streams and swampy areas. Bands of monkeys were common here, also agoutis, pacas, and opossums. Near the village were areas of second growth, thick masses of vines, brush, and trees 20 to 30 feet high. Also there were cleared areas, some with grass grown head high and others planted to corn. Sigmodon and 01-yzomys were common here and in an old banana grove where therc were also many signs of raccoons, skunks, opossums, and pocket gophers. Tracks of raccoons and coatis were nunlerous along the tide fiats. Bats were conlmon in the old buildings. Vampire bats were taken from hollow trees. Other mammals taken in this area were: Felis, Potos, Urocyon, Liomys, Nyctomys, Sciurus, Ototylomys, Coendou, Ilasypus, Sylvilagus, and Odocoileus. Rio GOASCOR~N, Dept.

Here were taken Liomys and Ototylomys along the rocky slopes, Sigrnodon and O?-yzomys in the savanna, Peromyscus in the woods, and bats along the rock cliffs. Skunks , coyotes, raccoons, foxes, and cottontails were also encountered. T h e headquarters ranch was known as Manzanilla. Rio SAN MIGUEL, Dept. San Miguel: 13O 25' N, 87O 44' W; about 3 mi NW of Lake Olomega; collected February 2- 21, 1926. This was the dry season. Headquarters was at a large cattle ranch owned by Enrique Prunera. Much of the lowland along the river was in pasture. There were also melon patches, old bean, corn, and cane fields, and a jungle-like Sorest nearby. Willows lined the river bank. A shallow lagoon was used extensively by raccoons, and deer fed along its edges. T h e fields and grassy areas were inhabited by Lio?rzys, O~yzorlzys, and Sigr11odo7~ as well as by some of the larger 1~1ammals. Nyctonzys, Ototylo,m,ys, Sciurus, Potos, and -17, 1927. O n the ridges and in the ravines were pines and deciduous oaks. Much of the area was heavily grazed, but there were a few small areas of grass along the streams. Also, there were sollle brushy areas, banana and coffee plantings, and rock cliffs. T h e rock cliffs aiforded shelter for Otofylonzys and Perom,ysczls mexicn~i,us; P. boylei was taken among the oaks, Oryzorn,ys and Sig~tzodon in grass or brush along strcanls. T h e oaks and pines were inhabited by S c i u~u s cleppei, S. vnl-iegnfoides, and Didelphis. T h e mammalian l'auna was poor here owing possibly to the overgrazed condition. A mine tunnel near the village was visited for the express purpose of collecting bats; nine kinds were taken. VOLCAN DE CONCHAGUA . VOLCAN DE SAN MIGUEL, Dept.

M,: In n~ost of the species thc tooth bears six sections preceded by an :unterior appendage-anteroco~le or trefoil. These scven parts are clefinetl by three labial and four lingual enamel folds, the lingual ones of uihich are tyl~ically longer and, thus, the labial sections usually are smaller than the 1ingu;rl o'ncs; they arc relatively smallest in Plae~~aconzys. Principal interspecific clirt'erences arc seen in size and degree of isolation of the sections anti, l);trticularly, in configuration of tllc anterior part of the tooth-anterior to the basic six sections. T h e patterns are arranged below approxilllately ill ordcr of increasing con~plcxity.

Longcr labial folds cut off a labial section and, thus, in each oP thesc forms the tooth has four scctions, the posterior one widest and lcast angular, plus a fifth which ljcars a11 indistinct cingulunl on its anterior face. In Clcthl-i07zomys, Lngzsl.zls, M. pinetorum, A4. ochl.ogaslo-, ant1 A4. gi~d in addition to the lobulate renlainder oE the cingulunl; thus, the tooth bears six closed posterior sections preceded by two 1 1 0 0 1~~~ AND IIART collliucnt ones ant1 a lobulate anterior appendage. I n L)ic?.ostonyx the anterior pair is isolated and, thus, the tooth has eight closed sections plus an indented anterior cingulum. T h e pattcrn in most species consist of lour sections preceded by an anterocone, these delineated by two labial and three lingual enamel folds. T h e posteromost section, the largest, is a full transverse loop, while the slllaller anterior three tend to be more angular and restricted to one or the other side of the tooth; although they vary in size, both intra-and inter-sl>ecifically, the labial one usually is smallest. T h e species are grouped below approxilnately in order of increasing cor~lplexity of occlusal pattern of M,. S y~z a p t o~~z y s bo~ealis is simplest. T h e tooth consists of three transverse units joined labially, labial folds being indistinct or absent. Longer labial Colds in S. cooperi cut off a labial angle and the pattern thus contains two large transverse posterior sections and a small labial one preceded lrty a slini transverse one which bears a slight cingulum on its anterior face. Long lingual folds are also seen in Plze?zaco~nys and ~h c tooth pattern is much like that in S. coopeli, except that the slrlall anterocone usually is isolated from the large anterior section. In the other species the lingual folds are shorter and the anterior cingulum is about the size of the anterolabial section. I n the lollowi~lg the tooth has three closed sections plus another anterior section which usually is confluent with the anterior cingulum: Cletlzrio~zotnys, Ondatra, and the following M i c~o l u s : oregoni, oclz~ogaste~, Pinelo?.zcnz, g~catenzalc~zsis, and 177iz~7-21s. 111 the Sollowing the cingulum is perhaps lrlore often closed off from the posterior Sour closed sections: Neofibel; Lcn7,111us, Lngzcj-zcs, and all other A/lic~olt~s. T h e pattern in Dic~ostonyx is perhaps the nlost conll>lex; there are four closed sections preceded by a lrilobed cingulum. M,: Although relative lengths of labial and lingual folds in M, and hiI, set Synaptorr~ys and Plzeizacovzys solnewhat apart from other forms, those in M, do not do so. In the following Sorills the tooth usually bears three closed transverse sections delineated by two labial and two lillgual folds: Sy~zaptonzys boi-enlis, Clelli~io1~071zys, M . o~e g o n i , AC. ~irlzardsoni, M . pi~zetorz~ilr, and all of the subgenus Aficl-otzcs. I11 the following the second labial fold tends lo divide the middle illto two parts, thus giving the pattern four sections: Syizaptonzys coope?.i, Phenaco?~zys, N e o f i b e~, Lagurz~s, A4. oclzrognstc~, Ad. guatenzalensis and Ondatra. T h e pattern in Dicrostonyx is perhaps the most complex. In it there are five closed sections, four of approximately equal size and a snlall one anterolabially. STRUCTURE OF THE POSTERIOR PART OF THE HARD PALATE.-In microtines the posterior part of the hard palate tends to be incoinplete, the lateral portions perforated by foramina and more or less excavated as posterolateral pits which also usually are perforated. In some forms-for example Cl~thriono9nys, Dicrostonyx, and Lenzmzu-the palate terminates posteriorly in a more or less complete transverse shelf which may or may not be furnished with a median process; in these, the posterolateral pits pass forward under, that is dorsal to, the palatal shell and, thus, their medial borders lorin n o part of the ventral face of the palate. In other species the posterolateral pits continue anteriad into the ventral part of the palate, leaving an undented medial portion-a spine or inclined septum-the sides ol which are the medial borders of the posterolateral pits. This sloping median septum may or may not extend over the mesopterygoiid fossa. These and other palatal arrangements are described in detail by Miller 1896ancl Hinton , but their variational limits within each species are not yet known. I t is clear, however, that between any two architectural types there are essentially all degrees of intermediacy. T h e species differ in regard to length of the palatal portion of the palatine bones and the location of the palatine-maxillary junction on the midsagittal plane of the skull. Among North American species the palatal portion of the palatines is smallest in Lemmus, wherein only a small posterior segment of the palate consists of palatines; the palato-maxillary midsagittal junction is situated posterior to the middle of M2. T h e palatal portion of the palatines is long in Ondatra, Phenacomys, Clethrionomys, Neofiber, Lagzlrzls, and M . richardsoni; in these the palato-maxillary midsagittal junction is situated anterior to M2. T h e other North American lornls fall between these two extremes. Synapton7ys cooperi, but not S. borealis, seems to be peculiar in that the palatines and maxillaries fuse very early in life, soon after birth, and their separate identities thereafter are not evident. In the other species the junction of those two bones on the palate is evident to inicldle or late age. SIZE AND SHAPE 01; THE ~A S I S P I I E N O I D . -T~~~~ are obvious differences in the basicranial axis among the species. Although we made no attempt to analyze all of tlre differences, the following characteristics of the basi-~phenoicl will serve to illustrate one of several basic cranial distinctions seen in the species. In Synaptomys bo~rtrlis and S. cooperi the basisphenoid is long and narrow. Posteriorly it is like an hourglass, strongly constricted beside wide and long posterior sphenoidal fissures. T h e anterior limit of the hasi-IIOOPER AN11 IIART sphenoid is situated anterior to the rnesopterygoid fossa and is hidden by the hard palate when the skull IS viewed ventrally. In L e m m z~s the basisphenoid is not quite as long and is less constricted posteriorly to conform to relatively smaller ficsures on each side of the bone. In all other North Anierican species examined the basisphenoid is short and wide. T h e posterior part is scarcely or not at all constricted and it is bordered by small foramina. T h e anterior limit of the bone is situated within the mesopterygoid fossa and is not hidden by the hard palate when the skull is viewed ventrally. Among these species, however, there are differences in regard to dorsoventral depth of the basisphenoid. T h e bone is shallow in Clethtionomys and Plzenacomys, intermediate in depth in 114. o~ego?ri and L a g z~~l u , and deep in the other forlns . and Synaptomys the ectopterygoid fossae are small and their almost fully osseous tvalls bear tew koramina and no large fenestrae interconnecting each lossa either with the blain cavity or with the mesopterygoid fossa. In Clethrionotny~ and Phenaconzys the ectopterygoid lossae are larger and their walls are less completely ossified, there being foramina into the po5terolateral palatine pits and small openings leading directly dorsad into the brain cavity; in some specimens there is a slight perforation to the mesopterygoid fossa but no large connection with it. In the other North American species examined the fossae are as large or larger than in Clethrio~zonzys and Phenaromys and, in addition, their walls are highly fenestrated, the openings connecting broadly dorsacl with the brain cavity, anteriad with the posterolateral pits, and mediad with the mesopterygoid fossa. A . -P O S~~~O~ of the dental foramen as a taxonomic character has been used principally by paleontologists. Its site on each mandible is individually variable within each species and that variation tends to obscure distinctions between species. Its position 1s related to site of the loots of the lower incisors. In Dicrostonyx, Phenaromy~, and Lagzlrzls it is situated proximally near the level of the lrlolar row. In Synaptomys, Lemmus, and Neofibe? its average position is slightly less proximal than in the aforernentioried group, but it is still near the level of the molar low. In the other North Amelican species it is situated distally, nearer the tip of the condylar process. Site of the Eoranlen with respect to the ~i d g e which extends ventrad from the tip ol the condylar plocess also varies. 'The loramen is situated posterior to the ridge in Dicrostonyx, Synaptomys, Lemmus, and Phenacomys. I t usually lies on the ridge or slightly posterior to it in Neofiber, Clethrionomys, and Microtus californicus; on or slightly anterior to the ridge in M. n~exicanz~s; and principally anterior to the ridge in the other species. AUDITORY B u L L A E . -T~~~-~ are interspecific differences in size of the auditory bullae and in architecture of their walls. T h e following information is from Hinton . In the following forms the bullae are large, and in the first three of them the mastoid portion also is somewhat inflated: Lagztrus, Chilotus, Pityniys, Lasiopodomys, Phaionzys, Dolonzys, and Synaptomys. They are moderate in Pedonzys , Clethrionomys, Eothenomys, Anteliomys, Alticola, and Dicrostonyx; and they are small in Lemmus, Ondatra, Neofiber, Arvicola, Phenacomys, Hyperacrius, Promethiomys, and Ellobizu. T h e bullae tend to be snlall in burrowing and amphibious species and larger in open-terrain terrestrial forms. In the following forms the walls of the bullae are spongy and threads of bony tissue, lined by mucous membrane, partly fill the cavity of the middle ear: Lemmzls , Dicrostonyx, Synaptomys, Plzaiomys, Chilotus, Proedromys, Microtz~s, Lagzirtls, Lasiopodomys, Pitymys, Pedomys, Neodon, Arvicola, Herpetomys, and Orthriomys. In the latter six forms the bony network may be inore open, and in Ellobi~ts and Promethionzys the walls contain stout septa. T h e walls are usually thin and there is slight or no spongy tissue in Clethriononzys, Asrhizomys, Eothenomys, Anteliomys, Alticola, Hyperacrizu, Dolomys, Phenaromys, Ondntra, and Neofiber. T h e glandes of North American microtines, all co~lstructed around a compound baculum, are remarkably similar in external shape and size. Among them there is not the diversity in form that is seen in some other cricetids in which the baculum is a single rod and the glans is architecturally comparatively simple. I n Neotonzn for example, the glans-to-hind foot ratios span 42 per cent and the diameter-to-length proportions have a spread of 88 per cent ; comparable ranges in P e~o~n y s c~r s are 35 per cent and 38 per cent, respectively . I11 contrast, in the microtines the glans-to-foot ratios range within 12 per cent and the diameter-to-length within 30 per cent. External shape is similarly constant in microtines; even the divergent species-Dicrostonyx torquatus, Neofiber alleni, and Phenncomys longicaz~dzu-are not as distinctive as variant species o l Ncotorrzn or Peromysczu. Shape and size of glans appear to be evolutionally less labile in species with a complex architecture centered on a four-part baculum. Seemingly the compound baculum has been an evolutioni~ry deterrent to diversity in form of glans. Nevertheless, microline species d o differ in regard to gross form and size of glans and there are pronounced interspecific differences in various particular parts of the glans. For example, the rim of the glans' terminal crater may be even in contour, without lobes, as in M. pinetorunz and M. mexicanus, or be divided by grooves into a pair of lateral sectors and a prominent dorsal lobe which extends beyond and overhangs the crater, as in Clethrionomys; there are all stages of intermediacy among the species.

Further, an examination of the Sylvilagus material at the National Museum of Brazil, Rio de Janeiro, suggests that there may exist specific variation from North to South even within the Mata Atlântica, and certainly that there exist numerous species-level taxa within \"Sylvilagus brasiliensis \" east of the Andean foothills. The principal hurdle in assessing and adequately describing this geographic and taxonomic variation is, however, the lack of a holotype for S. brasiliensis, habitual in many species described by Linnaeus. Further, there are no existing syntypes from which a potential lectotype could be selected. There are in fact no name-bearing type specimens associated with this species . A name-bearing type being necessary to objectively define Sylvilagus brasiliensis to ascertain the species limits and taxonomy, in accordance with Article 75 of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature , the purpose of the present work is to establish a suitable neotype, and begin the process of excision of valid biological species from a more naturally circumscribed S. brasiliensis. Morphological data: continuous characters-Cottontails of the genus Sylvilagus tend to be relatively homogeneous morphologically, and the range of intraspecific phenotypic variation in cranial characters among members of the genus so broad as to overlap interspecifically . Hence, we undertook analyses of mensural characters both on cranial and mandibular measurements as well as on mensural characters of lower premolar 3, a key dental feature in delineating species boundaries among Sylvilagus species , and White ; those that were not, or are modified, are defined below . Characters were: GLS, greatest length of skull; POSTORB, width of postorbital constriction; BROSTR and DEPROSTR, breadth and depth of rostrum-these were listed by Ruedas as being measured at plane of extremity of anterior zygomatic process but following the terminology of Wible would be modified to be measured at the anterior extremity of the masseteric spine on the maxillary portion of the zygomatic arch; BBRAIN, breadth of braincase; ZYGO1, greatest width across the masseteric spine on the maxillary portion of the zygomatic arch; ZYGO2, zygomatic breadth; LZYGO, length of zygomatic arch from anteriormost portion of masseteric spine on the maxillary portion of the zygomatic arch to posteriormost extension of jugal spine; NASALL, greatest length of nasal bone; NASALW, greatest width across left and right nasal bones; I2P2, least alveolar length of I2-P2 diastema; P2M3, greatest alveolar length of P2-M3 toothrow; HBRAIN, height of braincase; HBULLA, height of bulla, from ventralmost point of ectotympanic to dorsalmost point of external auditory meatus; CONDL, condylopremaxillary length of cranium; LPALFOR, WPALFOR, length and width of incisive foramina; PALONG, palatal length: from posterior edge of I2 alveolus to posterior extremity of palatal bridge; PALBRDGE, greatest anteroposterior dimension of palatal bridge; BASIOC, anteroposterior length of basioccipital; WIDBULL, width of auditory bulla, measured perpendicularly to the longest axis of the bulla , across its broadest dimension from the most external portion of the ectotympanic to the suture between ectotympanic and exoccipital, about even with the middle of the occipital condyle; ANTBULL, anteroposterior length of auditory bulla, from the most anterior projection of the ectotympanic to the most posterior point between the occipital and the paracondylar processes of the exoccipital; INTBD, least breadth across the basioccipital between the ectotympanic bones; OCCOND, width across the occipital condyles; INTBOC, length between the posteriormost edge of the palatal bridge and the suture between the basioccipital and basisphenoid bones; CHOANA, breadth of choanae-we measured this at the posterior narial opening, at the level of the second molar, hence this is technically the nasopharynx; MASTOID, greatest breadth across the mastoid exposure of the petrosal; DEPZYGO, least anteroposterior length across the maxillary bone at the base of the masseteric spine on the maxillary portion of the zygomatic arch; IP3, least alveolar length of i-p3 on mandibular body; MANDEP, depth of mandibular body below m1; P3M3, greatest alveolar length of p3-m3 in mandibular body; HMAND, height of the mandible from ventral aspect of angular process to most dorsal aspect of condyloid process ; HPTT, distance from ventral aspect of angular process to most dorsal aspect of pterygoid tuberosity; BCON, breadth of condyloid process, below articular facet; LMAND, length of mandibular body, from anterior edge of incisive alveolus to posteriormost aspect of angular process. Dental characters recorded from the third lower premolar included: wpostlof, greatest width of the posterior loph of pm3, wpm3, greatest width of pm3, aplpostl, greatest anteroposterior length of posterior loph of pm3, wantloph, greatest width of anterior loph of pm3, lantloph, greatest anteroposterior length of anterior loph of pm3, lpm3, greatest anteroposterior length of pm3, antlofar, area circumscribed by enamel in the anterior loph of pm3, pstlofr, area circumscribed by enamel in the posterior loph of pm3. Statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Analysis System software, version 6.03 . Similarly, no attempt could be made to determine presence or extent of sexual dimorphism in the taxa examined, although sexual dimorphism has been reported in measurements of Sylvilagus and, given small sample sizes, could affect results of multivariate analyses . Univariate statistics were calculated using the UNIVARIATE procedure of SAS. Two series of multivariate analyses were undertaken, the first only comparing specimens of S. andinus with S. brasiliensis, the second including those two species as well as S. tapetillus. In each instance, a principal component analysis was carried out first on the correlation matrix of the raw cranial data of complete specimens in the species under consideration measured in all the focal species: S. andinus and S. brasiliensis in the first analysis, then those two taxa as well as S. tapetillus, in order to determine whether any group separation occurred using the measurements taken. Such a posteriori grouping methods are preferred over a priori grouping methods because there is no prior hypothesis as to the putative identity of specimens examined. We undertook the principal components in a stepwise manner because we undertook the comparisons in a stepwise manner. For the initial comparison between S. andinus and S. brasiliensis only, given that the analysis is sample dependent, having included samples potentially ascribable to other taxa could have confounded the resulting variation in multivariate space in the direction of an added sample that was not germane to the particular comparison. We were interested first only in assessing whether there was any overlap by S. brasiliensis, of which we currently know of only the neotype , with other putative taxa. In the first instance, that was S. andinus, for which we had a broader sampling for morphological variation. The second, more complete series of principal component analyses, on all three focal taxa of this work, were carried out on the correlation matrix of raw data recorded only from specimens deemed adult based on ossification of occipital sutures and tooth wear, and for which a complete suite of measurements would assure inclusion in the principal component analysis. Morphological data: Discrete characters-Drawings of p3 crown enamel patterns were made by tracing from photographs taken using a Canon EOS 30D digital camera mated to a Canon MP-E 65 mm f/2.8 1-5X Macro Photo lens. Among leporids, p3 generally constitute the most informative dental elements for taxonomic and systematic purposes further noted that although P2 eventually might prove to be diagnostic, adequate descriptive work was lacking for that tooth. Discrete characters were deemed the most important in this particular research; accordingly, resulting figures were oriented and scaled to the same size in linear dimensions to carry out size-independent comparisons of interspecific characters. Characters considered are described in Appendix I of Ruedas ; the presumed plesiomorphic condition is exhibited by Lepus californicus, in the genus hypothesized as sister to Sylvilagus , Palacios et al. , and Erbayeva . Morphological data: Cladistic analysis of morphological characters-We analyzed the morphological data in order to assess the utility of the characters in evolutionary analyses, as well as to determine the distribution of character states across resulting trees. Cladistic analyses were carried out in PAUP* 4.0b10 , specifying Lepus californicus as the outgroup. We used the heuristic search algorithm with stepwise addition to obtain starting trees for branch swapping, specifying the tree bisection-reconnection algorithm to be used for branch swapping, with the addition sequence used in the stepwise addition set to random, and using 100 randomaddition-sequence replications. Bootstrap and jackknife explored 10,000 replications using the same specifications except for the use of 10 random-addition-sequence replications at each search, holding a single tree at each search. An initial analysis was undertaken using the dental characters employed by Ruedas , absent characters xix-xxiii, which are characters of the third upper premolar and were not surveyed in the South American taxa under consideration herein, and one additional character not used by Ruedas : character xxiv, lacunar remnant of p3 paraflexid present or absent . It may be unclear in certain species whether the lacuna on the lingual side of p3, in the area of the metaconid, is in fact formed by a fusion of the anterior and posterior lophs of p3, usually at the central angle, causing the lingual portion of the hypoflexid to become pinched off and perhaps reduced. For example, the latter could certainly be the case in the instance of some of the specimens illustrated by White , including †Alilepus hibbardi, , †A. vagus, , †?Alilepus sp. , †A. wilsoni, , †?A. browni, , †Pratilepus kansasensis, , †Aluralagus bensonensis, , †Nekrolagus progressus, , †Aztlatonolagus agilis, , and Romerolagus diazi, . However, in the specific instance of the character as we describe herein, the specimen of Lepus californicus that we examined had a distinct enamel-ringed lacuna cranial to a fully developed hypoflexid extending from labial to lingual sides of p3, hence is inferred to be a remnant of paraflexid, rather than the lingual aspect of the hypoflexid. We further note that this character may not be present in all specimens of L. californicus . In the first instance, we combined the taxa from the analysis of Ruedas as well as those examined in the present manuscript. That analysis resulted in an unresolved polytomy among Sylvilagus species. We then reduced the taxa to include S. andinus, S. brasiliensis, S. tapetillus, S. dicei, and S. floridanus, rooted by L. californicus. Ancestral state reconstruction was carried out in Mesquite . Once it was demonstrated that this analysis had some resolving ability , a subsequent, expanded analysis was undertaken that included additional taxa and in particular, included the cranial morphological characters used in the diagnoses of S. andinus, S. brasiliensis, and S. tapetillus. The additional characters, again polarized with respect to L. californicus, are as follows: xxv, braincase pitting , absent , present . xxvi, antorbital process present , absent . This character can be considered synonymous with characters 5 of Wible and 130 of Asher et al. : supraorbital notch absent or present , given that a supraorbital notch depends on the presence of an antorbital process. xxvii, postorbital process fused to cranium , free ; we note that although we scored this as plesiomorphic in Lepus, that is the condition exhibited by L. californicus: other species of Lepus display this character in its derived condition, thus additional paleontological material should be examined in order to indubitably ascertain the polarity and distribution of this character in modern and extinct lagomorphs. xxviii, caudal aspect of postorbital process rounded , or sharply pointed . Our characters xxvii and xviii are dependent on character 4 of Wible , which is equivalent to character 129 of Asher et al. : postorbital process present or absent ; we did not use this character because a postorbital process is present in all the Leporidae we examined, hence has no information content. xxix, zygomatic fossa present , absent . This is the character 19 of Wible and 119 of Asher et al. . However, those authors scored it as absent or present . In the present analysis, because a zygomatic fossa, the depression in the anterior zygoma for the lateral masseter, was present in our outgroup, L. californicus, the plesiomorphic condition in the analysis was presence rather than absence. xxx, frontoparietal suture interdigitated , smooth . We considered for this character any amount of interdigitation along the frontoparietal suture as character state : some of the individuals we examined had a smooth frontoparietal suture in the medial half of either suture line, and an interdigitated suture for the lateral portion of either suture . xxxi, frontonasal suture sharp, or V-shaped , broader, or U-shaped ; it is likely that this character may be found, upon broader taxonomic sampling, to constitute extremes of a continuum. For the taxa under consideration herein, however, this character is consistently binary. xxxii, nasal process of frontal long or short . In species of lagomorphs, there is variation in a process extending facially from the frontal bone between the posterodorsal process of the premaxillae and the nasal bones. This nasal process may be short or absent , or extremely long, up to a third of the length of the nasal bone. xxxiii, single or multiple foramina in the basisphenoid bone. In the plesiomorphic condition, the basisphenoid bone is pierced by a single aperture, the craniopharyngeal canal . The craniopharyngeal canal, a developmental remnant of the connection between the roof of the pharynx and the developing pituitary gland , can be identified by its orientation: running obliquely in a posteroventral to anterodorsal direction, and is generally the only opening present in the basisphenoid of lagomorph species, or the principal opening. Additional openings in the basisphenoid, possibly fenestrae rather than foramina, may be present and appear to be consistent at the intraspecific level. J. H. Wahlert noted with respect to this character that the more anterior perforations also have been identified as the craniopharyngeal canal . The precise identity of the perforations in the basisphenoid therefore bear further scrutiny. Lastly, character xxxiv: premolar foramen absent , present ; this character is extensively detailed in the main text of the present work.

Molecular data-The analyses are based on sequences from the mitochondrial 12S ribosomal and cytochrome b loci as used in previous studies investigating the phylogeny of Leporidae , following the manufacturer's recommendations. Primers used for amplifying and sequencing 12S rRNA were 12C and 12G , and for cyt-b were CytB1F and CytB5R . 12S rRNA polymerase chain reaction program consisted of an initial denaturation of 94ºC 3 min., followed by 35 cycles of 94ºC 40 sec., 42ºC 2 min. and 72ºC 3 min, ramping 1°C/sec, and final extension 72°C for 30 min. Amplifications were carried out in a total volume of 50 μL with about 30 ng of DNA, 10X buffer, 6 ng/µL of each primer, 0.5 mM of dNTPs, 5 mM of MgCl 2 and 1.25 U of Taq DNA polymerase . PCR program for amplification of cyt-b fragment comprised an initial denaturation 94°C 3 min., followed by 40 cycles of 94ºC 45 sec., 52ºC 30 sec., and 72ºC 1.5 min, and final extension 72°C for 10 min. PCR was undertaken in a final volume of 25 μL with about 30 ng of DNA, 10X buffer, 4 ng/ µL of each primer, 0.1 mM of dNTPs, 5 mM of MgCl 2 and 1 U of Taq DNA polymerase . PCR products from both reactions were purified using 20% polyethylene glycol /2.5 M NaCl solution. Sequencing products were precipitated in an ethanol/EDTA solution, re-suspended in Hi-Di formamide and sequenced with BigDye 3.1 Terminator kit in an ABI PRISM 3730 Genetic Analyzer . Both strands were sequenced to improve accuracy of base calling. Sequence chromatograms were visually inspected and manually corrected using Chromas Lite, v.2.1.1 . DNA also was harvested from dried skin clips for one specimen, Sylvilagus andinus UMMZ 77075, using a modified version of the Fulton et al. and Moraes-Barros & Stenghel Morgante extraction protocols. Hair and the outer dermal layer were scraped from the sample using a sterile scalpel. The skin clips were then sterilized in a 0.5% bleach solution for 30 seconds before three, 1-minute rinses with UltraPure ™ distilled water . The sterilized skin clips were then cleaned and initially rehydrated in 1 mL of UltraPure™ distilled water at room temperature for seven days. The water was replaced each day. After seven days in water, the sample was fully rehydrated in 1 mL of TE buffer for two days with replacement of the TE buffer each day. At the end of the two-day rehydration period, the sample was washed three times in a 0.5 M EDTA solution. Finally, DNA was isolated from the sample using the standard Qiagen DNeasy instructions with the following modifications. Initial digestion conditions included 180 uL buffer ATL, 20 µL of Proteinase K, and 20 µL of 1M DTT. After the ethanol washes, the column bound DNA was eluted into 50 µL of H 2 O. 12S and cyt-b were amplified in 150-350 bp overlapping fragments using primers developed in Primer3 , Sylv247F , Sylv423F , Sylv747F , Sylv905F , Sylv298R , Sylv590R , Sylv850R , Sylv1012R , and SylvR . 12S primers were as follows: 12sSylvF , 12sSylv305F , 12sSylv535F , 12sSylv232R , 12sSylv663R , and 12sSylvR . Amplifications of each fragment were performed in 12.5 µL aliquots using the following conditions: , 0.75 µL Primer 2 , 3.75 µL H 2 O, 1 µL DNA . Thermal conditions were as follows: 95 ºC for two minutes, 40 cycles of 95ºC for 30 seconds, 45ºC for 45 seconds, and 72ºC for 45 seconds, followed by a final 72ºC, 5-minute elongation. Prior to loading, the thermal cycler was heated to 80ºC per the requirements of the HotStarTaq. Approximately 2 μL of PCR product was visualized on a 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresed at 300 volts for 20 minutes. Successful reactions were purified via QiaQuick PCR purification kits eluted into 50 uL of H 2 O. Eleven µL of purified PCR product and 4 µL of the appropriate sequencing primer were mixed and sequenced using the Power Read service provided by Eurofins Genomics . Sequences derived from the complete mitochondrial genomes of the domestic rabbit, Oryctolagus cuniculus and collared pika, Ochotona collaris were used as references to align our sequences. Reference sequences were 961 and 956 nt , and 1139 nt . We also included new and GenBank sequences as follows, for 12S rRNA: Bunolagus idahoensis, AY292695, U58921, S. floridanus, AY012126, AY292698, new, Texas A&M AK11178, AK114511, S. gabbi , new, Angelo State University Natural History Collections nos. 2328 , 2329 , 2330 , new Texas A&M AK11525, S. audubonii, AY292696, S. nuttallii, AY292697, U63886, S. aquaticus, AY292700, S. palustris, AY292701, U63885. For cyt-b: B. idahoensis, AY292721, S. floridanus, AY292724, S. obscurus, AY292725, S. transitionalis, AF034256, S. aquaticus, AY292726, S. palustris, AY292727, S. nuttallii, AY292723, S. audubonii, AY292722 . Chimeric 12S+cyt-b sequences used the following: B. idahoensis, AY292695 + AY292721, S. floridanus, AY292698 + AY292724, S. obscurus, AK11516 + AY292725, S. transitionalis, AK11525 + AF034256, S. palustris, AY292701 + AY292727, S. aquaticus, AY292700 + AY292726, S. audubonii, AY292700 + AY292726, S. nuttallii, AY292697 + AY292723. To adequately date cladogenic events within Leporidae, for the analysis undertaken in BEAST, we added to the chimeric sequences noted above the following chimeric sequences: Lepus americanus, AY292707 + AY292733, L. brachyotis, AB058613 + AB058616, L. californicus, AY292705 + AY292731, L. capensis, AY292706 + AY292732, L. europaeus, AJ421471 + AJ421471, L. saxatilis, AY292704 + AY292730, L. timidus, AB058610 + AB058607, L. townsendii, AY292703 + AY292729, Oryctolagus cuniculus, NC001913 + AY292717. GenBank accession numbers for the new sequences generated for this paper are listed in Table 1 . Initial alignments were produced using Clustal X, version 2.0 and its default values for alignment parameters. The 12S rRNA gene alignment was further refined following the two-dimensional structure model of stems and loops proposed by Springer et al. . Final alignments were adjusted in Mesquite 3.02, build 681 . Best-fit selection of nucleotide substitution models was based on the Bayesian Information Criterion , as implemented in jModelTest2 version 2.1.6 and model corrected, were calculated in PAUP* 4.0b10 . Maximum likelihood analyses were undertaken on 12S and cyt-b separately, then combined; each analysis used a separate model of evolution elucidated as described above. The ML analyses were conducted using RAxML v. 8.2.4 , which uses a GTR model of evolution. The dataset was initially partitioned for the different loci in order to assess the complementarity between the two data sets: while the 12S rRNA gene shows strong phylogenetic signal among Leporidae, the utility of cyt-b has been questioned at the intergeneric level . We ran 1000 replicate ML searches, assessing clade confidence with 1000 bootstrap pseudoreplicates using the thorough bootstrapping algorithm. Phylogenetic analyses of Sylvilagus taxa were rooted using Brachylagus idahoensis, the presumed sister taxon to Sylvilagus . Bayesian analyses were undertaken using MrBayes 3.2.4 . We ran four independent Markov chain Monte Carlo analyses, each with eight Metropoliscoupled chains, an incremental heating temperature of 0.1, and an exponential distribution with a rate parameter of 25 as the prior on branch lengths. Analyses were run for 100 million generations, with parameters and topologies sampled every 1000 generations. We assessed stationarity and convergence by plotting the -ln L per generation in the program Tracer 1.6 , and dropped samples prior to achieving -ln L asymptote as burn-in. We assessed whether the four analyses reached stationarity at a similar likelihood score and that the topologies were similar, and used the resultant trees to calculate posterior probabilities on a 50% majority rule consensus tree. For molecular dating methods , we used fossil based dates of divergence coupled to a relaxed molecular phylogenetics technique as implemented in the program BEAST, v.1.8.1 , which simultaneously estimates phylogeny and divergence times among the sampled taxa. We used an uncorrelated lognormal relaxed molecular clock model and a Yule prior on the tree to simulate the process of speciation . Operators were tuned in successive runs of BEAST under the chosen model of evolution, with slight changes to the scaling factors until the Effective Sample Size for each parameter exceeded 200 . When optimum operator scaling was achieved, we re-ran the analysis for 20 million generations. Burn-in was assessed based on having reached a stable negative log likelihood , and trees prior to reaching an asymptote discarded from the beginning of the run; all samples were examined in Tracer to verify an effective sample size exceeding 200 for all parameters being estimated. We initially calibrated our molecular clock analyses using a divergence estimate, derived using fossils, of 47.6 MYA between Ochotonidae and Leporidae. This date was suggested by Benton et al. based on the rationale that the fossil material described by Rose et al. was referable to Leporidae. This latter taxonomic assignation we feel is not justified at this time: the robust Shanghuang taxon is located within the Rose et al. phylogeny based on a single calcaneus, resulting in six characters being represented in a data matrix of 228 characters, or 2.6% representation; their gracile Shanghuang and Vastan lagomorphs' taxonomy is based on two calcanea and a single talus resulting in the presence of 20 of 228 characters, or 8.8% representation in the data matrix . Notwithstanding, the first occurrence of Ochotonidae is definitively documented in the Eocene, specifically the Uintan North American faunal stage, 42-46.2 MYA , and †Litolagus, 33.9 MYA . Given the foregoing uncertainties, combined with the long branches and rate variation in the matrix, as well as the fact that we were fundamentally interested in timing cladogenic events within Sylvilagus, the final analyses in BEAST were conducted using Sylvilagus, Brachylagus idahoensis, and Oryctolagus cuniculus, with Lepus as the outgroup. The 19 taxon analysis relied on two fossil calibration points: basal diversification of Sylvilagus at 4.4 million years ago , and basal diversification of Lepus at 4.5 MYA . Justification for assigning that age to Sylvilagus is presented below [see: Restoration of Sylvilagus andinus ]. Assignment of Lepus to that age is more controversial. The oldest undisputed Lepus fossils date from the Blancan to Irvingtonian transition in North America and Middle Pleistocene of Kenya . Dawson listed a fossil record for Lepus of Pleistocene of Eurasia, North America, and Africa, with possibly a Mid-Pleistocene origin from †Nekrolagus. Older assignments remain problematic: a Barstovian age, for example, is based on a single astragalus \"similar to that of Lepus\" in the Rosamond Series of the Upper Miocene .

{"text": "As a consequence of the foregoing, including morphological, molecular, and chromosomal data, we suggest that Thomas' hypothesis that Sylvilagus tapetillus in fact constitutes a species distinct from S. brasiliensis is not currently falsifiable and should stand. Statistical analyses The main distinguishing feature is, as noted, size. The principal component analysis including the holotype-and only known specimen-of S. tapetillus and comparing it with the specimens of S. andinus and S. brasiliensis support this important distinction. As in the previous principal component analyses, PC 1 is size based ; the large neotype of S. brasiliensis and small juveniles of the S. andinus series at either end of the distribution in multivariate space of PC1 support this hypothesis. The distinction in principal components between S. andinus, for which a somewhat larger sample is available, and S. brasiliensis on the one hand, and S. tapetillus on the other is on the basis of the shape-based principal component 2. That component is loaded heavily on interorbital breadth , and width of alisphenoid constriction and incisive foramina ; dentary toothrow to some extent also contributes to this PC . The measurements of these characters in S. tapetillus can be confirmed to be somewhat divergent from those of S. andinus and S. brasiliensis: S. tapetillus, despite its small overall size, has the broadest interorbital breadth among the specimens examined for this work. The alisphenoid constriction of S. tapetillus is, in contrast, the smallest among the specimens measured. Similarly, the width of the incisive foramina of S. tapetillus is equal to those of S. andinus UMMZ 77077 and UMMZ 77078, which we consider subadult and young adult based on fusion of cranial sutures, and only 70% that of the adult neotype of S. brasiliensis. We further note that all the S. andinus specimens have much narrower incisive foramina than the neotype of S. brasiliensis, adults averaging 4.91+0.47 mm, in contrast to 6.4 mm in S. brasiliensis. Hershkovitz suggested that the holotype of S. tapetillus also was not an adult and explicitly compared it to Field Museum of Natural History no. 26877, a young female from Teresópolis, Rio de Janeiro , noting that there were strong overall similarities in size. While we caution that we have not NHMUK 1892.11.24.3 . Among the specimens examined, the first three principal components together account for 90.8% of the variation . Results of this principal component analysis are graphically summarized in Fig. 26 . Character abbreviations as in Table 1 examined the FMNH specimen firsthand, there are mensural discrepancies between the measurements provided by Hershkovitz and those we took from the holotype of S. tapetillus. In particular, the length of the nasals for FMNH 26877 was listed as 21.5 mm, to 25.3 mm for the holotype of S. tapetillus, the mean of adult S. andinus for this dimension is 25.18+3.16 mm, contrasting with 31.4 mm in the neotype of S. brasiliensis. Similarly, alveolar length of maxillary toothrow was reported by Hershkovitz for FMNH 26877 as 11.1 mm; we recorded this dimension as 13.0 mm in the holotype of S. tapetillus. The mean of this dimension in adult S. andinus was 12.40+0.89 mm, the same measurement in the neotype of S. brasiliensis was 14.6 mm. Thus, the proportional differences in mensural characters between the holotype of S. tapetillus and the specimen identified by Hershkovitz as a young adult, FMNH 26877, as revealed by the principal component analysis and direct comparison of mensural data, all support Thomas' hypothesis that the holotype of S. tapetillus is an adult, and therefore represents a species distinct from S. brasiliensis. Cranial morphology Sylvilagus tapetillus: diagnosis. Sylvilagus tapetillus is distinguished from other species of Sylvilagus by the following combination of characters: cranium extensively pitted with minute, shallow pits; pitting extending through frontal bones rostrally well into interorbital region and along frontal suture almost to antorbital region; antorbital process present only as an emargination rather than a process; narrow, relatively long postorbital process ending bluntly, tightly fused to the frontal throughout caudal half, on the tuberculum frontoparietale; masseteric spine projecting strongly rostrally from anteroventral aspect of zygomatic arch; strongly interdigitated frontoparietal suture, strongly U-shaped, between each frontal and parietal bone; frontonasal suture intermediate between V-and U-shape; short but evident process between posterodorsal process of premaxillae and nasal bones; and premolar foramen absent. Mandible relatively robust dorsoventrally; large, labially located mental foramen, with extensive ventrocaudally oriented trail of minute foramina originating from mental foramen. Crown enamel pattern of third lower premolar relatively simple, with single marked anteroflexid invagination near rostrolingual aspect of anterior lobe; protoflexid marked, with uniformly slightly thick enamel throughout; deep paraflexus with some complexity at terminus and on rostral margin; shallow but distinct hypoflexus with clearly marked mesial and distal hypercones. Sylvilagus tapetillus: general aspects of cranial morphology.-As noted in the diagnosis, aspects of some cranial characters further support maintaining S. tapetillus as distinct. The NHMUK 1892.11.24.3 . Data are reduced to include as many specimens as possible in the analysis. As in Fig. 23 , the clusters of three S. andinus in the leftmost area of the graph are specimens aged by us as immature. Note the divergent position of S. tapetillus along principal component axis 2 relative to remaining Sylvilagus taxa examined. That axis is shape based and mostly determined on the dimensions of interorbital breadth , width of incisive foramina, and width of alisphenoid constriction . skull of the holotype is shown in Fig. 26 . Thomas noted in the description of S. tapetillus that the slender postorbital processes were \"anchylosed terminally to the skull in the type, and merely leaving a narrow foramen about 2 mm. in length.", "meta": {"ref_id": "MP205.json"}}
{"text": "This character is shown in the complete perspective of the cranium of S. tapetillus and in detail, in comparison with the neotype of S. brasiliensis in Fig. 27 . The neotype of S. brasiliensis has a postorbital process that is fused to the frontal bone at the tuberculum frontoparietale, near the angulus sphenoidale of the parietal bones. The width of the postorbital process is ca. 2.2 mm and the length of the suture between the postorbital process and the frontal bone is ca. 1.7 mm in straight line distance , the length of the resulting foramen is ca. 4.2 mm. In the holotype of S. tapetillus, as noted by Thomas, the postorbital process is more slender: ca. 1.5 mm, and is in fact tightly fused to the frontal bone. The length of the fusion is ca. 3.2 mm on either side. However, it is not a simple rostrocaudal fusion, as in S. brasiliensis: the caudal terminus of the postorbital process ends on the tuberculum frontoparietale, in FIGURE 26-Views of the cranium of the holotype of Sylvilagus tapetillus : dorsal , lateral , and ventral . Greatest length of skull was not recorded by us due to the fact that the cranium is broken at the occiput, hence that linear dimension is unreliable; however, it was recorded by as 61 mm; zygomatic breadth, 32.2 mm. a laterally oriented fusion ca. 0.7 mm in length. Thus, the postorbital to frontal fusion is in effect L-shaped and inverse L-shaped when viewed dorsally, such that the frontal bone cups the terminus of the postorbital process. The resulting foramina are, as Thomas noted, ca. 2 mm in length. If this degree of fusion between postorbital process and frontal bone results from ontogenetic variation, then the impression of the holotype of S. tapetillus as an adult is reinforced, contra Hershkovitz' suggestion that it is immature. The adult nature of the holotype of S. tapetillus also is reinforced by the fact that the pitting present in the dorsal surface of the skull, as it is in the neotype of S. brasiliensis, is more worn than in the also adult neotype. With respect to the frontonasal suture, this character is more equivocal and subject to population variation. In spite of that reservation, the frontonasal suture of the holotype of S. tapetillus appears to be more V-shaped than the frontonasal suture of the neotype of S. brasiliensis, which we characterized above as having a broadly rounded rostral terminus. Mandibular morphology The mandibles of the pertinent specimens examined for this work are shown in Fig. 28 . In the neotype and referred specimen of S. brasiliensis, there is variation in the size of the mental foramen; the neotype has a relatively inconspicuous mental foramen, the referred specimen, UFPE 470, has a more evident, somewhat longer and slender mental foramen. The mental foramen is small and inconspicuous in the holotype of S. andinus. The holotype of S. tapetillus has a relatively larger, more substantial, mental foramen in both vertical and horizontal dimensions. In addition, the mandibular body of S. tapetillus bears some fenestration, or the presence of numerous pinhole size openings, leading ventrocaudally from the mental foramen toward the ventral margin of the mandibular body. This fenestration is completely absent from the neotype of S. brasiliensis. The referred specimen of S. brasiliensis has some rugosity present in this portion of the mandibular ramus. The holotype of S. andinus has even less rugosity than the referred specimen of S. brasiliensis but is not as featureless in this character as the neotype of S. brasiliensis. Additional pitting is visible in the holotype of S. tapetillus at the rostral edge of the mandibular ramus where it meets the mandibular body. This pitting is absent from any of the key reference specimens examined herein. The relative location of the coronoid process in the holotype of S. tapetillus differs from that of S. brasiliensis in that it is located on the rostral aspect of the mandibular ramus approximately midway between the articular head of the condylar process and the sulcus ascenden; in the S. brasiliensis specimens, the coronoid process is located about a third of the distance down the rostral aspect of the mandibular ramus. The holotype of S. andinus is more similar to S. tapetillus in this character. The anteroposterior dimension of the mandibular ramus relative to its height also appears to differ among the specimens examined: the ratio of width to height of mandibular ramus is 0.34 in S. tapetillus, 0.30 in S. andinus, and 0.29 and 0.28 in the neotype and referred specimen of S. brasiliensis, respectively. Indeed, although the holotype of S. tapetillus has the shortest dorsoventral dimension among adults of the comparative series examined , it has the broadest anteroposterior mandibular ramus: S. tapetillus: 10.3 mm; S. brasiliensis neotype and referred specimen: 10.2 mm FIGURE 28-Comparison of the right dentary bones of : holotype of Sylvilagus tapetillus ; neotype of S. brasiliensis ; referred specimen of S. brasiliensis ; holotype of S. andinus . Images not to scale. and 9.4 mm, respectively; holotype of S. andinus, 10.2 mm. The masseteric line, wherein inserts the superficial masseter muscle, on the ventral edge of the angle of the mandibular ramus, also differs somewhat among the specimens examined. However, it may represent to some extent ontogenetic variation : the neotype of S. brasiliensis has a prominent masseteric line ending rostrally in an ovoid process and caudally in the masseteric and pterygoid tuberosities; the masseteric line and ovoid process are not as prominent in the referred specimen of S. brasiliensis. The caudal aspects of the mandibular ramus are not available for inspection in any of the critical comparative material examined herein. Notwithstanding, the masseteric line is thin but evident in S. tapetillus; in S. andinus, the masseteric line is reduced in size but still evident, but the anterior ovoid process is extremely reduced. The ovoid process in S. tapetillus is manifested as a large, diffuse region in the anteroventral portion of the mandibular ramus, rather than as a discrete process, as in the neotype of S. brasiliensis . A final distinction between S. tapetillus and remaining specimens examined is the prominent vacuity present in the mandibular ramus. A vacuity often is present in the ramus of Sylvilagus specimens. Habitually, it is located in the ventrocaudal region of the angle, however, in the holotype of S. tapetillus, it is large and located in the center of the masseteric fossa. Wible pointed out that there is a small ridge in Ochotona in the same region of the angle as these vacuities are present in S. brasiliensis and S. andinus. One may speculate that in the absence of this ridge, the edges of the vacuity may provide insertion points for a subdivision of the masseter muscle. In S. tapetillus, the vacuity is located at the insertion point of the posterior deep masseter, whereas the vacuities in the ventrocaudal region of the angle are at the insertion of a branch of the superficial masseter . The location and size of the vacuity in the ramus therefore strongly suggests a functional distinction in the masticatory apparatus between S. tapetillus and remaining species examined, and as such may also be phylogenetically informative; a broader population sample will be required to assess more fully the extent and significance of this character. Dental morphology The dentition of S. tapetillus is similar to that of S. brasiliensis, but somewhat simpler. In particular, the third lower premolar has a single anteroflexid, to a double in S. brasiliensis. Specimens of S. andinus show a great deal of variation in this character, thus it is possible that the number of anteroflexida will vary. Both specimens have a slight depression in the area corresponding by homology to the paraflexid, but the paraflexid is absent in both. The thickness of the enamel in this region of the rostral loph differs between the holotype of S. tapetillus and the neotype of S. brasiliensis . The protoflexid of the holotype of S. tapetillus is shallow, and shaped as a somewhat open, shallow V. Above, we characterized the protoflexid of the neotype also as broadly U-shaped. The holotype of S. tapetillus in addition displays enamel of homogeneous thickness throughout the protoflexid, in contrast to the neotype of S. brasiliensis, which tapers from extremely thick on the labial margin of the protoconid, to extremely thin on the labial wall of the protoflexid. The hypoflexid is similar in both specimens, with the rostral margin showing a single central angle and thick enamel, and the caudal margin being constituted by thin enamel and almost devoid of crenellations. The second upper premolar differs between the two specimens in that the mesoflexus of S. tapetillus is shallow and surrounded by thick enamel, contrasting with deeper mesoflexus and thick enamel lingually transitioning to thin labially in S. brasiliensis. The hypoflexus is absent in the neotype of S. brasiliensis but present and shallow in the holotype of S. tapetillus, distinctly isolating a mesial hypercone, which is absent in the neotype of S. brasiliensis. In terms of size of the teeth, the anterior loph of lower premolar 3 of the holotype of S. tapetillus is 2.2 mm in greatest width to 3.1 mm in the neotype of S. brasiliensis, and 1.7 mm in anteroposterior length , to 1.9 mm in the neotype of S. brasiliensis. Both specimens are subequal in greatest anteroposterior length of pm3, 2.6 mm in the holotype of S. tapetillus to 2.7mm in the neotype of S. brasiliensis. The second upper premolar of the neotype of S. brasiliensis is 3.1 mm in width, the corresponding measurement in S. tapetillus is 2.9 mm. It remains to be ascertained how these characters will stand up to the scrutiny of a larger population sample, however, in the absence of such a sample; they reinforce the distinct nature of the two species. Cladistic analysis of morphological characters As outlined in the materials and methods, an initial analysis of the morphological characters was undertaken by combining the taxa from the analysis of Ruedas with those examined in the present manuscript. Because that analysis resulted in an unresolved polytomy among Sylvilagus species, we then reduced the taxa to include the taxa focal to this research, namely: S. andinus, S. brasiliensis, S. tapetillus, and S. dicei, as well as S. floridanus, rooted by L. californicus . Two equally most parsimonious trees resulted from that analysis . Including in the analysis only the aforementioned taxa recovered S. brasiliensis as basal, and a con-sistent sister taxon relationship between S. floridanus and S. tapetillus. The relationships of S. andinus and S. dicei in the analysis were not consistent, and bootstrap and jackknife analyses yielded an unresolved polytomy at the base of an ingroup Sylvilagus exclusive of S. brasiliensis. Ancestral state reconstruction carried out in Mesquite indicated that, for this limited analysis, basal nodes a and f, discriminating between Lepus and Sylvilagus are defined by character xvi of Ruedas , and character xxiv, defined above. The former refers to p3, central angle angled such that an [almost closed] lacuna is formed in the medial portion of the hypoflexid , vs. no lacuna formed by CA in hypoflexid . Nodes d and j, uniting S. floridanus and S. tapetillus, are defined by characters x and TABLE 5-Distribution of character states used in the morphologically based phylogenetic analyses . .

The neotype of S. brasiliensis is denoted by an asterisk. xiii of Ruedas . We expanded the analysis by including additional taxa and in addition, the cranial morphological characters used in the diagnoses of S. andinus, S. brasiliensis, and S. tapetillus. The expanded analysis yielded six equally most parsimonious trees, 56 steps in length, with a consistency index of 0.518 and a retention index of 0.449 . Twenty-four of the characters were parsimony informative. A number of clades were recovered more consistently in this analysis. Dental characters defining clades were covered above. With respect to the additional cranial characters, none supported the generic dichotomy between Sylvilagus and Lepus. Within Sylvilagus, S. nuttallii was consistently recovered as outgroup to remaining Sylvilagus . However, this localization was due to retention of primitive characters rather than the species being defined by any autapomorphy, dental or cranial. A monophyletic clade comprising S. brasiliensis and S. palustris was recovered in all the equally most parsimonious trees, albeit of uncertain affinities. This clade received support from 56% of the bootstrap trees and 70 of the jackknife trees . The group is defined only by dental character xv, reflected angle of p3 hypoflexid not highly reflected, versus reflected in remaining taxa. The cranial morphological characters we used define the clade by their combination rather than any single or multiple characters being consistently derived in this clade to the exclusion of remaining species. All other recovered groupings were not defined by any consistent autapomorphic characters; rather, by the distribution and combination of characters. This included for example the clades comprising S. andinus and S. tapetillus, represented in three of the equally most parsimonious trees, 28% of the bootstrap trees, and 38% of the jackknife trees; {{S. andinus + S. tapetillus} S. dicei}, represented in three of the equally most parsimonious trees, 18% of the bootstrap trees, and 28% of the jackknife trees; and {S. floridanus + S. tapetillus}: two of six trees, 32% of the bootstrap trees, and 36% of the jackknife trees. While the morphological characters we employed, both dental and cranial, served in combination to diagnose the species, few were diagnostic of clades. Additional morphological characters will be required in order to indubitably define the clades based on synapomorphies unique to the constituent species pairs or groups. However, we wish to highlight two findings. First, although S. andinus and S. tapetillus appear as sister taxa in three of the morphological trees, there are no synapomorphies exclusive to this morphological clade, the clade is not supported at a level greater than 50% in either bootstrap or jackknife analyses, and the distribution of characters is such as to lead us to conclusively reject the hypothesis of conspecificity for this pair of species. Similarly, in none of the analyses did S. andinus obtain as sister to S. brasiliensis, thereby highlighting from a morphological perspective the stark taxonomic and evolutionary differences between the two taxa, whose hypothesis of conspecificity is definitively rejected by the ensemble of our data. Molecular systematics of the South American [30] [31] [32] [33] We first undertook analyses of the molecular data on each mitochondrial gene separately. For the 12S rRNA gene, 1070 nucleotides were recovered from the neotype of S. brasiliensis, encompassing the complete gene sequence. The degraded nature of the DNA recovered from the S. andinus specimens proved more problematic, 588 nucleotides in two segments were recovered from UMMZ 77075. The gap between the two segments almost completely overlapped a loop feature from the proposed two-dimensional structure model of the 12S rRNA , which would have rendered alignment in that region difficult. As a consequence, analysis of the 12S sequences was ultimately undertaken on a 660 nucleotide segment of the gene. The model of evolution resulting from jModelTest for the more complete 12S sequence dataset was the GTR+I+Γ . The transition:transversion ratio for the data set was 5.0681, nucleotide frequencies were: A, 0.3744, C, 0.2454, G, 0.1576, and T, 0.2226. The proportion of invariable sites was 0.4240, with rates at variable sites conforming to a gamma distribution with shape parameter of 0.488. For the cyt-b mitochondrial gene, we recovered 1057 nucleotides from the neotype of S. brasiliensis, and 237 nucleotides from S. andinus UMMZ 77075. The model of evolution resulting from jModelTest for the cyt-b data was the HKY with Gamma-distributed among-site variation. The ti:tv ratio was 7.9733 for this marker, nucleotide frequencies were: A, 0.2765, C, 0.3265, G, 0.1199, T, 0.2771. The Gamma shape parameter was 0.186. We also created chimeric species by concatenating the 12S rRNA and cyt-b sequences corresponding to the same species. Since these were from the same studies, it is likely that they correspond to the same individual, hence there should be no doubt as to the taxonomic identity, or about \"creating\" an artificial species by joining sequences from distinct genes.

{"text": "Herein we provide a comprehensive summary of available information on the mammals of Great Basin National Park based on a review of published records, historical museum MONOGRAPHS OF THE WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST [Volume 4 specimens, and our recent field surveys. We discuss the present-day fauna in the context of historical biogeography and the Quaternary fossil record of the region. We also conduct a comparative analysis of records from the early MVZ surveys with results from our surveys to investigate historical changes in local mammal communities during the past 70 years. Finally, we discuss factors relating to long-term management of biodiversity in the park. Great Basin National Park is located entirely within the southern portion of the Snake Range, in White Pine County along the eastern border of Nevada . As with most mountain ranges of the Great Basin, the Snake Range is oriented along a north-south axis. It is divided into northern and southern segments by Sacramento Pass . Because the drainage divide is nearer the western flank, the transverse profile of the range is asymmetric: the western flank is steep and lacks foothills, whereas the eastern slope is less abrupt and has extensive foothills. The range exhibits a nearly complete stratigraphic series of early Cambrian to Pennsylvanian rocks . Orogeny involved initial thrust-faulting during the late Mesozoic or early Tertiary, followed by granitic intrusion and subsequent faulting in the middle and late Tertiary. During the Pleistocene, glaciers developed at higher elevations along with a pluvial lake in adjacent Spring Valley. Quaternary deposits of sand and gravel have formed alluvial fans in association with stream channels on the eastern and western flanks of the range . The local elevational gradient of nearly 2300 m from the floor of Spring Valley to the summit of Wheeler Peak is the most extensive in the interior Great Basin . The extreme variation in temperature and moisture across this gradient, coupled with geological and edaphic complexity, has resulted in a diverse range of habitats within the park region. Major plant associations are divisible into 4 general elevation zones: low-elevation desert shrub below 1950 m, consisting of xeric shrub communities dominated by greasewood , shadscale , saltbush , black brush , and big sagebrush ; and riparian habitat dominated by willows ; mid-elevation woodland and shrub, 1951-2450 m, consisting of communities dominated by piñon pine , juniper , curlleaf mountainmahogany , quaking aspen , and sagebrush ; and riparian areas dominated by willows , narrowleaf cottonwood , and water birch ; high-elevation forest, 2451-3200 m, consisting of subalpine forests of Engelmann spruce , white fir , and Douglas-fir ; and montane meadows dominated by perennial grasses, sedges, and forbs; alpine forest and tundra, above 3200 m, consisting of forest, krumholtz, and tundra communities near treeline and above, with limber pine , bristlecone pine , dwarf juniper , currants , and herbaceous perennials. During the Pleistocene, cycles of climate change in the Great Basin caused elevational shifts in vegetation . Presumably, this produced cycles of relative connectivity and isolation between highland areas, with resultant episodes of colonization and localized extirpation in the mountain systems of this region. Throughout the Holocene, these mountains remained habitat islands, sustaining plant and animal populations largely isolated from each other by intervening arid lowlands. As a result, mountain ranges in relatively close proximity may support very distinctive biotas. This is certainly true for the nonvolant mammal faunas, in which many taxa have very uneven distributions across neighboring mountain systems . The effects of disturbance on the local ecology by humans and domesticated animals over the past century are both significant and long lasting. men and sight records within the park region before 1945. Recent records for bats are from Ports and Bradley and Krejca and Taylor . We included sightings and sign records by park staff and visitors . For records not supported by voucher specimens, we gave the most credence to reports from trained professionals and to instances involving repeated observation of species that can be identified unambiguously. Regional prehistoric records of extant mammals were summarized from published reports on excavated cave deposits from sites within the park region including Lehman Caves , Snake Creek Cave , Smith Creek Cave in the Snake Valley. We did not verify identifications presented in these reports; however, most of the prehistoric records were extensively reviewed by Grayson . This is the same general approach used in early regional surveys , Sherman live traps, and Macabee gopher traps to capture small mammals. Small shrews were principally captured in pitfall traps constructed from aluminum beverage cans . Separate trap lines of 5-50 traps were placed in areas of relatively uniform habitat and were operated for 3-5 consecutive nights. Traps were placed in runways, beside fallen logs, by burrow openings, or in other locations with signs of small mammal activity, and were baited with a mixture of oatmeal and peanut butter or mixed bird seed . Pitfall traps were not baited, but over time, captured insects probably increased the traps' effectiveness for capturing shrews. All traps were examined each morning and late afternoon. Relative trapping effort was measured as cumulative trap-nights . Live-trapped animals were marked and released at the point of capture after positive species identification. Animals captured in snap traps were prepared as voucher specimens and are housed at UMNH and at the Field Museum, Chicago, Illinois . Identifications of specimens at FMNH and UMNH were verified by the authors. Taxonomic nomenclature follows Wilson and Reeder . Within the text, elevations are reported in meters. Historical records originally expressed in feet have been converted to meters with the original English measurements reported in parentheses. To investigate recent historical changes in the small mammal fauna, we compared records from early MVZ surveys to our recent surveys undertaken within the same general region: a section of the eastern slope of the southern Snake Range extending from the floor of the Snake Valley to the crest of the range near Wheeler Peak . Because most historical localities could not be located with great precision, our recent fieldwork seldom involved resurveys of precise collection localities. Accordingly, historicalrecent comparisons were made at a broader \"landscape\" scale by pooling data from localities falling within 4 elevation zones: low-elevation sites below 1950 m encompassing sites in the valley floor, foothills, and riparian areas along the lower portions of Lehman and Baker creek drainages; mid-elevation sites between 1951 and 2450 m in the Baker and Lehman creek drainages; high-elevation localities between 2451 and 3200 m in the Lehman and Baker creek drainages; and localities in the alpine zone above 3200 m surrounding the headwaters of these drainages. Comparisons were limited to small taxa inventoried both historically and recently with standard mammal traps . For each elevation zone, we assessed temporal changes in the mammal fauna by comparing relative abundance of species within pooled samples from historical localities and recent surveys . Based on standard field protocols, the use of historical specimen counts as a proxy for actual capture frequencies is justified. In general, uncommon species were saved when-ever they were collected, and although some specimens of abundant species were discarded, they were still represented by larger numbers or bootstrap procedures . Species absent in a single time interval were included in the chi-square analysis under the assumption that sampling was sufficient to demonstrate true absence or extreme rarity. This assumption enabled all species across time intervals to be included in the analysis. Rarefaction accounts for different sample sizes , permitting the direct comparison of abundance over time . For recent samples, expected chi-square frequencies are based on those from historical samples and assumed the same total abundance. Species absent in the historical time interval were not included in the rarefaction, but were included in the resulting graphs to indicate changes in presence and absence over time. For both bootstrap and rarefaction methods, 1000 iterations generated 95% confidence intervals around mean abundance values of each species. Further assessments were made by comparing the rank abundance of species. We located 893 historical specimen records representing 48 species of mammals collected from the greater park region. Of these, 848 records are from a single source, the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, University of California . A total of 390 specimens representing 31 species were collected from localities now within the park boundaries. Most of these represent specimens collected between 1929 and 1939 from sites in the Baker and Lehman creek drainages. The 2000-2003 surveys we conducted covered a broad elevational range in the park region and included the entire spectrum of local habitats. Collectively, they involved 4379 trapnights and yielded 642 captures representing MAMMALS OF GREAT BASIN NATIONAL PARK 26 species, from which 520 voucher specimens were saved. From all sources of information, 64 species of native mammals have been recorded from the greater park region . Information on each is summarized in the following accounts. Brachylagus idahoensis Pygmy Rabbit This species, which is endemic to the Great Basin, is restricted to areas dominated by big sagebrush at lower elevations on valley floors and bajadas . The only specimen record from the park region is from Spring Valley southwest of Osceola; additionally, Hall reported a sighting from Baker Creek. During our recent surveys, small rabbits observed in sagebrush habitat on the eastern margin of the park might have included pygmy rabbits, but may well have been young Sylvilagus nuttalli that were documented in this area. We consider records based on sightings or sign records to be equivocal. Nevertheless, it is possible that this species occurs in areas dominated by big sagebrush at low to mid-elevations within and surrounding the park. There is considerable unevenness in the local distribution and abundance of pygmy rabbits, and they are threatened by habitat modification and fragmentation . Late Quaternary records indicate that pygmy rabbits declined with the spread of piñonjuniper woodland , mirroring a historic trend of increasing piñon-juniper that may, in part, explain the recent decline of this species. Pygmy rabbits and other species associated with sagebrush habitat might benefit from management plans to reverse the spread of piñon-juniper habitat in the park HISTORICAL 11.3 Black-tailed Jackrabbit Black-tailed jackrabbits are abundant through out the Great Basin and occupy a variety of open, low-elevation habitats . This species is commonly observed in open desert and woodland habitats at low to mid-elevations in the park region. During our surveys black-tailed jackrabbits were often sighted from 1860 m to above 2440 m . At least occasionally, jackrabbits occur at much higher elevations; in June 2003 an individual was observed crossing a snowfield near tree line at 3230 m . HISTORICAL Desert cottontails range throughout the southern portion of the Great Basin, achieving their northernmost limit in Nevada in the park region . They occur in desert shrub, piñon-juniper, and riparian habitats at low elevations . There are no museum voucher records from within the park, but the species has been documented at sites in the northern Snake Valley east of Mt. Moriah. HISTORICAL km E Smith Creek Cave, 1707 m , 2 MVZ, collected 1937*; 6.4 km E Smith Creek Cave, 1 MVZ, collected 1937*. RECENT RECORDS.-none. Sylvilagus nuttallii The mountain cottontail occurs in a wide variety of habitats over a very broad elevational range from sagebrush flats to subalpine coniferous forest . Historical records and recent observations indicate that it is abundant in the park. Most common at low to mid-elevations, it has a broad elevational range. A specimen from 3170 m in the north Snake Range represents the high-elevation record for the species , 1 MVZ, collected 1983*. RECENT RECORDS.-none. American Water Shrew Water shrews are restricted to riparian habitat, usually along permanently flowing streams at mid-to high elevations . Although records of occurrence span a broad elevational range, data suggest that water shrews are uncommon in the park region. Despite considerable trapping effort in suitable habitat along several stream drainages, recent surveys produced only 1 record from the upper reaches of Lehman Creek. Past activities in the park region, including stream diversions, extirpation of beavers, and introduction of nonnative trout , have certainly affected the riparian habitats occupied by water shrews, causing an alteration of their distribution and relative abundance. Throughout its geographic range there are relatively few records of the Inyo shrew. In part this may reflect the difficulty of capturing these tiny shrews using traditional trapping methods Owen 1980, Rickart and Heaney 2001) . However, a single specimen of this poorly known species was collected in July 2000 along the south fork of Lehman Creek at 3018 m elevation and represents a significant distributional extension about 200 miles into the central Great Basin . This specimen was taken in a pitfall trap in rocky, streamside habitat in spruce-fir forest. Several Sorex vagrans also were taken at this locality. Elsewhere, Inyo shrews have been found in a wide variety of habitats from piñon-juniper woodland to high-elevation alpine meadows . The species may have a relatively broad distribution within the park, but apparently it is uncommon. HISTORICAL RECORDS. Vagrant shrews have been captured in a wide variety of habitats throughout their range . In the Intermountain region, this species generally is most common at low to mid-elevations , but on many of the isolated mountain ranges in the interior Great Basin, it occurs at high elevations as well . This is true in the park region, where it has been documented across an elevational range of more than 1219 m . Vagrant shrews occupy a wide variety of microhabitats but are most common in relatively moist situations with abundant invertebrates. In recent surveys the species was Pallid bats are found in a broad range of habitats from low desert to coniferous forest and utilize a wide variety of roosting sites . Records from the park region represent the northern limit of the known distribution of this species within the central Great Basin . This widespread species is more abundant in coniferous forests than in deciduous forests . Big brown bats forage in a variety of habitats and utilize many different types of roosts, including hollow trees, caves, and mines. The big brown bat is also one of the most common species roosting in buildings . Big brown bats are widespread in eastern Nevada . There are several unvouchered records from mines and caves within the park, and the species has been documented from sites on the western side of the Snake Range. Although relatively uncommon, the spotted bat occurs throughout much of Nevada . It forages in a wide variety of habitats and roosts primarily in rocky cliff faces . Although there are no specimen records of this distinctive species from the park region, it was sighted in 1966 at Model Cave in the Baker Creek cave system and is widespread in Nevada . It is migratory in many areas of its distributional range. Silver-haired bats often roost singly or in small groups within hollow trees, under bark, and occasionally in buildings or caves. They prefer both forested and grassland habitats and often forage over water . The species has been recorded at sites along the western slope of the south Snake Range. It is probably an uncommon but regular seasonal visitor to the region. HISTORICAL RECORDS. Although distributed throughout Nevada, this solitary and migratory species has been recorded at few localities in the park region. Nonetheless, it has a broad elevational and latitudinal range and occurs in a wide variety of habitats, but most frequently in forested areas . As a seasonal migrant, it is probably a regular but uncommon visitor. HISTORICAL RECORDS. In Nevada the California myotis principally occurs in low-elevation desert habitat and utilizes a wide variety of sites as day roosts and hibernacula . Most Nevada records of this species are from the western and southern portion of the state , Ports and Bradley 1996*. Also recorded at Mount Washington . Western Small-footed Myotis This species is one of the most common and widespread myotis in the western United States , with many records from throughout Nevada . The small-footed myotis occurs mainly in forested areas and utilizes a variety of roosting sites but is not as arid adapted as the California myotis . There are records from throughout the park region, principally at low elevations. HISTORICAL RECORDS. The long-eared myotis is one of the more common bats found in the western United States, occurring throughout Nevada, where it is principally found in forest . It is often associated with coniferous forest but may also occur in arid plant communities at low elevations, and it utilizes a wide variety of roosting sites . The species probably occurs throughout the park region. . Long-legged Myotis This large species of myotis occurs throughout the western states where it typically is associated with montane, coniferous forest habitats but can be found in riparian and desert habitats . Based on the number of records from the park region, this clearly is a common species that spans a broad elevational range. HISTORICAL . Most Nevada records are from localities in the western and southern portions of the state . The species has been documented at a single site on the western slope of the Snake Range, which represents the northernmost record for eastern Nevada . It is probably an uncommon bat at low elevations throughout the park region. HISTORICAL RECORDS. 1989) . These bats are abundant in the southwestern United States, where they form very large colonies in caves and mines . Rose Guano Cave, located on the western slope of the Snake Range, is a major roost site that supports an estimated 75,000 bats of this species . Records from the park region are near the northern distribution limit for this species in the central Great Basin . Although there is only 1 historical specimen record from the park region, there are numerous records of sightings and vocalizations . This species has a broad distribution and occupies a wide variety of habitats . There are many reports of gray fox from within the park region . In 2000 we observed an individual several times in the Grey Cliffs area along lower Baker Creek. In 2001 a specimen was salvaged north of Stella Lake. Gray fox generally occupy brushy or rocky habitat and probably are most common at low to mid-elevations. HISTORICAL RECORDS.-Lexington Creek, 2042 m , 1 MVZ, collected 1962; Mouth of Snake Creek, 1 MVZ, collected 1931*. RECENT RECORDS.-Baker Creek, 2164 m , sightings in 2000; 0.4 mi N Stella Lake, 3210 m , 1 UMNH, collected 2003; multiple sightings in the park, 1844-2621 m , Allan 2004. Kit fox prefer areas of shrubsteppe or shrubgrass communities . Although no specimens are known from the south Snake Range, there are early sight records of kit fox in Spring Valley and multiple recent sightings from the region, mainly at low elevations . Kit fox are most often associated with sagebrush, shadscale, and greasewood communities . They appear to be fairly common in such habitats at low elevations within the park and in adjacent areas outside park boundaries. HISTORICAL RECORDS.-Spring Valley near Osceola, ca. 1890 m , Hall 1946*. RECENT RECORDS.-Multiple sightings in park region, 1615 m to ca. 2428 m , Allan 2004. The red fox is one of the most widespread and adaptable carnivores, occurring in a great variety of habitats. The species has been widely transplanted, and within North America its geographic range has expanded during the historical period . Although there have been sightings in the region, there are no confirmed records from within park boundaries. In the past, a fox farm was apparently located on lower Strawberry Creek . This, plus the few early records from the central Great Basin and in Snake Valley and occur principally in the southern and eastern portions of the Great Basin, reaching a distributional limit in eastern Nevada . There are no historical specimen records of ringtails from the south Snake Range; however, there are numerous reports of the species within the region , and a park reference collection includes a specimen from Baker Creek . Ringtails primarily occupy rocky habitats at low to mid-elevations . In the interior Great Basin, they principally occur at high elevations in forested habitat . None were trapped during recent surveys. However, a small weasel seen near Lincoln Peak at 3414 m elevation was probably an ermine. Most of the recent sightings of weasels at higher elevations in the park Long-tailed Weasel Long-tailed weasels occur over a broad elevational range from desert shrub to alpine meadows . However, they are most abundant in open habitats at lower elevations . Although none were trapped during recent surveys, the number of reported weasel sightings suggests that they are quite common throughout the park region. HISTORICAL RECORDS. RECENT RECORDS.-Multiple sightings in park and park region . American Badger Badgers occur over a broad elevational range and in a variety of habitats . During recent surveys, extensive badger diggings were noted in desert shrub habitat at the park administrative site near Baker and on the bajada east of the park boundary. There have been many recent sightings, mainly at low and mid-elevations and reported sightings at low elevations in Snake Valley to the east . The availability of appropriate habitat suggests that this species is probably common at low elevations through out the region. HISTORICAL Bobcats occur throughout the Intermountain West but most commonly in brushy or rocky habitats where they are principal predators of rabbits and hares ; habitat choice appears to be influenced by prey abundance . Numerous reports from the region suggest that the species is common, particularly in rocky areas at low to mid-elevations. HISTORICAL In addition to historical museum records, there are many recent reports of cougars within the park . In western North America, this species is the principal predator of mule deer and other ungulates . All scats collected from sites at low to mid-elevations contained fragments of large bone and ungulate hair . Given the abundance of deer, there is probably a relatively large regional population of cougar. HISTORICAL The cliff chipmunk generally occurs in areas of rock outcrops and cliffs and is strongly associated with piñon pine and juniper woodland . Compared to other chipmunk species, there are relatively few historical specimen records from the region, most being from areas in the north Snake Range. Recent surveys indicate that the species is relatively uncommon. However, given the broad extent of appropriate habitat, it is probably widespread at low to mid-elevations. Among North American chipmunks, this species has the widest geographic range and ecological distribution . It occurs over a wider elevational gradient than do most other species of chipmunk, but in the Great Basin it is most often found in areas dominated by big sagebrush . Near Snake Creek at 2550 m , we found least chipmunks in an area of dense sagebrush, but they were replaced by Uinta chipmunks in immediately adjacent stands of spruce and aspen. Numbers of least chipmunks appear to have declined in the years since the early MVZ surveys; in 1929 least chipmunks were common along lower portions of Baker The Uinta chipmunk has a very broad ecological distribution, but where it occurs with other species of chipmunks, it generally is restricted to forested habitats . In the Great Basin this species has a discontinuous distribution within the forested zones of the major mountain ranges . It is one of the most abundant and widespread small mammals in the park, occurring in habitats ranging from piñon-juniper woodland and riparian corridors at low elevations to areas at or above timberline . Historical specimen records from the region are all from areas below 2134 m elevation. In July 2000 we found it in desert shrub communities on the bajada east of the park entrance and in the Snake Valley north of Baker. These squirrels are common at lower elevations, but principally in areas outside the park boundaries. HISTORICAL HISTORICAL Golden-mantled Ground Squirrel Golden-mantled ground squirrels occur in a wide variety of habitats from piñon-juniper woodland to alpine tundra . Within the park region, historical records indicate a very broad elevational range for this species . In recent surveys, it was encountered only at sites above 3050 m . Several individuals were seen near timberline and 1 at the summit of Wheeler Peak, the highest point in the park. This species appears to have declined in abundance since the early surveys. In the 1920s it was present along the Lehman and Baker creek drainages in areas where it was not encountered in recent surveys. Golden-mantled ground squirrels most commonly occur in open coniferous forest; they avoid dense timber and may decline under conditions of increasing tree density that have resulted from fire suppression . In Nevada the Piute ground squirrel occurs in low-elevation desert shrub communities dominated by sagebrush, shadscale, or greasewood . Most of the appropriate habitat for this species lies outside the current park boundaries. These squirrels have a prolonged period of aestivation/hibernation that lasts for up to 8 months, and they are normally active aboveground only during late winter and spring. Accordingly, they were not re corded in recent surveys conducted during summer months. However, their characteristic burrow systems were seen at sites in Snake Valley and at the park administrative site north of Baker, areas where specimens had been collected in the past. HISTORICAL As its name implies, the rock squirrel is most abundant in rocky habitats such as boulder fields, talus, rocky hillsides, cliffs, and steep canyons . Rock squirrels occur over a broad elevational gradient in the Snake Range , as is the case on several other isolated mountain ranges of the interior Great Basin . There are only 2 historical records of marmots from the region, neither of which is supported by a voucher specimen . These include a sighting near Hendry Creek in the northern Snake Range and a reported marmot sign near \"Treasury Lake\" in the southern Snake Range; the latter presumably refers to Treasure Lake, a small pond located immediately east of Baker Lake . Currently, marmots are uncommon in the Snake Range, with most recorded sightings from mid-elevations in the Baker and Strawberry creek drainages . There are no historical records from the southern Snake Range or adjacent areas in the Spring or Snake valleys. Long-tailed pocket mice most commonly occupy areas of rocky soil or rock outcrops at low to mid-elevations, principally in areas dominated by sagebrush . In the park region these mice have a relatively broad elevational range Botta's pocket gopher is a widespread species that occurs in a variety of habitats . Within the Intermountain Region, it usually occurs in areas with deep soils at relatively low elevations . In the Snake Range and some other interior mountains of the Great Basin, this species also occurs in high-elevation, montane habitat in areas with thinner, rockier soils. Typically, such habitat supports the northern pocket gopher , which is locally absent Food availability is perhaps the most important factor that determines habitat suitability for beavers . There are no specimen records of beaver from the Snake Range or surrounding areas in eastern Nevada, although they have been reported in the Humboldt and Colorado drainages and in the past were abundant in northern Nevada . The nearest historical records are from the Ruby Mountains, ca. 150 km NW of the park and the Virgin River drainage, ca. 150 km to the south in Utah . Beaver remains have not been recovered from any regional cave deposits. Despite the absence of local records, there is direct evidence that beaver formerly occurred within the Snake Range. In 2000 we found vegetated dam terraces and very old gnawed stumps of aspen at 2347 m along Baker Creek. Old beaver sign has also been reported from the Lehman, Shingle, and Strawberry creek drainages . The site on Baker Creek was dominated by aspen and included many trees with 20-to 30-cm trunk diameters that must have become established only after beavers were absent. Trees in this size range may be considerably older than 100 years , which indicates that beaver probably disappeared from this site more than a century earlier. This is a strong indication that the species was native to the region rather than introduced for commercial or management purposes. With the development of ranching and local irrigation in Nevada, beavers were apparently eliminated in some areas in the mistaken belief that this would increase local availability of water , and such may have been the situation in the Snake Range. In any event, they apparently disappeared before the MVZ fieldwork in 1929 because they were not encountered in those surveys. In 2003 beavers from an unknown source colonized Strawberry Creek near the park boundary, but they have since left this area . Regional records indicate they are most abundant at low elevations. In our recent surveys they were relatively common in grass-sedge meadows near springs or seeps at elevations of 1981-2438 m . Specimens also were taken at the park administrative site near Baker and at sites in foothill shrub communities east of the park boundary. These last sites had extensive cheatgrass, which indicates that the distribution and abundance of harvest mice may be increasing with the spread of nonnative annual plants. HISTORICAL RECORDS. Canyon mice are restricted to rocky areas, including talus, boulder fields, cliffs, and rock outcrops, often over a very broad range of elevations . There are many historical records from sites at low to mid-elevations within the park region, but few from the southern portion of the Snake Range. In our recent surveys, canyon mice were recorded at only 2 localities in the park. HISTORICAL RECORDS.-Near Smith Creek Cave, Mt. Moriah, 1768 -2195 The deer mouse is the most widespread and locally abundant mammal in western North America, occurring in virtually all habitats, from the most arid deserts to alpine tundra . Within the park region it has been recorded from low-elevation valley bottoms to areas above timberline elevation. However, the species was also documented over a broader elevation and habitat range . In 2003, 1 specimen was trapped at 3249 m near timberline north of Pyramid Peak on an open, rocky slope with scattered bristlecone and limber pines. Another was taken at 3261 m in a stand of bristlecone pine near Mount Washington. These may represent the highest elevation records for this species in eastern Nevada, and they verify earlier reports of its occurrence at elevations well above the piñon-juniper zone . In 2000 a single specimen of this species was taken in a rock outcrop at 2804 m elevation. We failed to trap any woodrats or find any recent evidence of them along Baker Creek where they were abundant 70 years earlier, even in places where we saw old nests and other sign. The cause of this dramatic decline or disappearance at low elevations is unknown. Bushy-tailed woodrats normally exhibit a fairly wide elevational distribution but may be subject to heat stress and local population extinction , 1 UMNH, collected 2000. The desert woodrat occurs in arid desert shrub and piñon-juniper habitats on open, rocky slopes or in sheltered areas near rock outcrops and cliffs . Regional records are from sites at low to midelevations . In our recent surveys they were found in the bajada shrub community east of the park boundary. The presence of many large stick nests at this site indicates they were fairly abundant. As with Neotoma cinerea, historical records show that Neotoma lepida was once common in limestone cliffs along the lower portion of Baker Creek, where woodrats are now either absent or very rare. HISTORICAL Long-tailed Vole The long-tailed vole occurs in habitats ranging from semiarid grassland to alpine meadows . It is one of the most abundant and widespread species in the region, occurring over a very broad elevational gradient . In recent surveys it was caught in relatively dry, grassy areas near the eastern park boundary, riparian habitat along creek drainages between 2134 m and 3018 m elevation, wet subalpine meadows, and alpine tundra above timberline. Comparison of historical and current records suggests that this species may be expanding into low elevations, possibly in response to the spread of nonnative annual grasses. This widespread species is found throughout the mountain west, occurring in wet meadows, forests, and riparian habitat . However, records indicate that montane voles are less common and widespread than are long-tailed voles, reflecting greater ecological restriction to wet habitats . In recent surveys, only a few individuals were trapped in very wet meadows and adjacent to streams. Sagebrush voles are generally restricted to areas dominated by various species of sagebrush and bunchgrasses , from the floor of Snake Valley to 3048 m on Mt. Moriah. The species was not recorded during our 2000-2003 surveys despite considerable trapping effort in many sites dominated by sagebrush. Sagebrush voles are colonial, their distribution is highly patchy, and their populations fluctuate drastically . Consequently, sagebrush voles might benefit from the recent removal of cattle from the park as well as proposed management practices aimed at reversing the spread of piñon-juniper woodland and the loss of sagebrush habitat There are no specimen records for this species from the Snake Range or surrounding areas in eastern Nevada. The nearest historical records are from Ruby Lake, ca. 150 km NW of the Snake Range . However, muskrats have been reported in the southern Snake Valley along Big Spring Creek and in Pruess Lake , and in 2002 they were sighted on Baker Creek . In the past, muskrats were introduced into some Great Basin wetlands for commercial purposes , so it is possible that populations in the park region originated from introductions. However, the species has been recovered from a prehistoric site in the Snake Valley . There are several historical records from the southern Snake Range, suggesting at one time they were common over a broad elevational gradient . In our recent surveys, we found no sign of this species, although there were recent reports from the Snake Valley, including the town of Baker . Currently, porcupines are apparently quite rare within the park. They appear to have declined dramatically throughout the Great Basin, possibly due to increased predation by cougars .

{"text": "According to Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil , there are eight principles for palm oil farmers to become RSPO-certified: \"1) commitment to transparency; 2) compliance with applicable laws and regulations; 3) commitment to long-term economic and financial viability; 4) use of appropriate best practices and millers; 5.4) efficient use of fossil fuel and preferably renewable energy; 5.5) avoidance of the fire use, unless it has proven to be the best or only solution; 5.6) reduce pollution and emission. In November 2018, a new report with \"RSPO Principles and Criteria\" guidelines was released. The principles are sharpened and more tangible. Another difference compared to the RSPO 2013 is the three defined impact areas: prosperity, people and planet. These three impact areas -also referred to as the three P's -are a common concept in sustainable development. According to Hammond Although most principles are related to prosperity and people, the planet is also seen as an important impact area. The development that the planet has become a separate impact category, suggests that biodiversity, as an important element of the planet pillar, also seems to have become more of a priority in the new P&C. However, within the criteria of principle 7, biodiversity is not mentioned once. In the definition section, biodiversity is neither mentioned. A reason or explanation behind this development compared to the RSPO P&C 2013 was not found in literature or official documentation. Presumably politics -related to the uncertainties involved when quantifying biodiversity -were involved in this decision, but this assumption cannot be proven in any way. The entire Impact Goal Planet chapter of the RSPO is found in Appendix B. Summarized the RSPO demands the following to reduce the impact on the planet: A comparison of the full criteria of both RSPO and RSPO that tackle the environment -and thereby the planet, including biodiversity -can be found in Table 1 . The main difference is the way in which the criteria are formulated. The latest RSPO P&C have more criteria and the criteria are more concrete. The RSPO has made an attempt to make the criteria more SMART: Strategic, Measurable, Attainable, Results-oriented, and Time-bound . The criterion that concerns biodiversity, criteria 5.2 of RSPO P&C 2013 and criteria 7.12 of RSPO P&C 2018, is rephrased. \"The status of rare, threatened or endangered species\" within the criterion has disappeared and thereby High Conservation Values forest might be susceptible to wrong interpretation of the meaning. In the definitions chapter of RSPO P&C 2018, HVC is extensively defined. There are six types of HCV areas mentioned, namely in terms of 1) species diversity; 2) landscape-level ecosystems, ecosystem mosaics and Intact Forest Landscapes ; 3) ecosystems and habitats; 4) ecosystem services; 5) community needs; 6) cultural values. An area with high species diversity is considered to be a HCV area according the RSPO definition. However, this species diversity is only used as a criterion to determine which areas cannot be converted into palm oil plantations. The RSPO does not include anything about the species richness -the used definition of biodiversity in this research -on the palm oil plantation itself after it is converted. Biodiversity loss reduction is thereby not explicitly a criterion to be RSPO-certified. An important improvement however in the RSPO P&C 2018 compared to the RSPO P&C is the the inclusion of a roadmap towards Sustainable Palm Oil Production . Table 1 . Criteria of RSPO P&C 2013 with the corresponding criteria of RSPO P&C 2018 that are related to the environmental impact reduction . 1 Aspects of plantation and mill management, including replanting, that have environmental impacts are identified, and plans to mitigate the negative impacts and promote the positive ones are made, implemented and monitored, to demonstrate continual improvement. Pests, diseases, weeds and invasive introduced species are effectively managed using appropriate Integrated Pest Management techniques. 1Practices maintain soil fertility at, or where possible improve soil fertility to, a level that ensures optimal and sustained yield. 4Practices minimise and control erosion and degradation of soils. 5No new planting on peat, regardless of depth after 15 November 2018 and all peatlands are managed responsibly. 2The status of rare, threatened or endangered species and other High Conservation Value habitats, if any, that exist in the plantation or that could be affected by plantation or mill management, shall be identified and operations managed to best ensure that they are maintained and/or enhanced. Land clearing does not cause deforestation or damage any area required to protect or enhance High Conservation Values or High Carbon Stock forest. HCVs and HCS forests in the managed area are identified and protected or enhanced. 123 Waste is reduced, recycled, re-used and disposed of in an environmentally and socially responsible manner. Waste is reduced, recycled, reused and disposed of in an environmentally and socially responsible manner. 4Efficiency of fossil fuel use and the use of renewable energy is optimised. Efficiency of fossil fuel use and the use of renewable energy is optimized. 5Use of fire for preparing land or replanting is avoided, except in specific situations as identified in the ASEAN guidelines or other regional best practice. Soil surveys and topographic information are used for site planning in the establishment of new plantings, and the results are incorporated into plans and operations. 6Fire is not used for preparing land and is prevented in the managed area. 6Plans to reduce pollution and emissions, including greenhouse gases, are developed, implemented and monitored. Pesticides are used in ways that do not endanger health of workers, families, communities or the environment. 2Practices maintain the quality and availability of surface and groundwater. 8Plans to reduce pollution and emissions, including greenhouse gases , are developed, implemented and monitored and new developments are designed to minimise GHG emissions. 10Conclusions of the literature review Meijaard et al. have investigated the link between oil palm and biodiversity. A lot of research has been done on the difference in biodiversity between natural forest and palm oil plantations . It can be concluded that oil palm plantations have lower biodiversity levels compared to tropical rainforest . Meijaard et al. also identified eight requirements that are key to the future success of more responsible palm oil production programs. This transition will require \"scientists to create an improved evidencebase of in-situ certification effectiveness to continuously refine criteria to be more vigorous and effective in meeting environmental goals among highly variable production systems and groups of stakeholders\" . The combination of the fact that research has been done on differences between plantations and natural forests and the need for evidence of effectiveness of certification is combined in this research. Little research has also been done on the scale of plantations. One study on bird diversity between large industrial oil plantations and smallholdings indicated that the bird assemblages are similar, but the small scaled plantations support slightly higher levels of bird species richness . Therefore, the possible influence of the size of the plantations on biodiversity is also studied in this research. In order to obtain a better understanding in the possible impact of management measures taken within palm oil cultivation on terrestrial biodiversity, a data study is being conducted. Data on two main aspects is used. Spatial data on palm oil cultivation, with a particular focus on the presence of RSPO certification and the size of the plantation. 2Spatial data on the current biodiversity levels -in other words species presence. An overlay of these two data sources will be used to answer the main question of what is the impact of RSPO certification and the size of palm oil plantations on terrestrial biodiversity. The entire code that has been executed can be found in Appendix D. Multiple data sets on oil palm plantations are available worldwide. As the analysis is focused on diversity within plantations, two spatial data sets were used: A data set that attempts to distinguish between natural forest and various stages of plantations . The data set includes all the plant species and therefore only \"Oil palm\" for the variable named \"spec_org\" in the original data set was selected. The key countries on which this data set is focused are Brazil, Cambodia, Colombia, Indonesia, Liberia, Malaysia, and Peru. As this research only concerns Malaysia and Indonesia, the plantations within this area were selected. The subset that is used in the analysis therefore Clearing/very young plantation: bare ground with contextual clues suggesting it will become a plantation .\" ", "meta": {"ref_id": "Master_Thesis_Report_Cathelijne_Stikkers_The_influence_of_certification_and_size_of_palm_oil_plantations_on_terrestrial_biodiversity_in_Indonesia_and_Malaysia.json"}}

It is a federal crime to steal fossils from public lands. permits, but only if the bones are then placed in a museum; all fossils remain the property of the U.S. government. Digging up and selling fossils from private land is legal. Some Western senators, including Tom Daschle, a South Dakota Democrat, are looking for ways to loosen restrictions on fossil hunting-something Padian and the Society for Vertebrate Paleontology strongly oppose. The society would also like to see a ban on the export of fossils dug up in the United States as a way to ensure that any scientifically valuable fossils-even if they come from private land-are maintained in museums for study and public view. \"We believe these are part of the whole country's heritage,\" said Ted J. Vlamis, a Wichita, Kan., businessman and president of the group Save America's Fossils for Everyone. A 1995 poll commissioned by the Dinosaur Society and the Society of Vertebrate Paleontologists found that 61% opposed the sale of scientifically important fossils and that 91% thought that museum or university personnel should be the ones to dig up fossils.

{"text": "At a press conference held at National Geographic Headquarters October 15, a team of Geographic-supported experts unveilied the fossil, which they named Archaeoraptor liaoningensis. At the time, the team members announced that the 125-million-year-old creature, as well as two other fossils from China which were also featured, demonstrated that feathers were widespread among theropods, the carnivorous dinosaurs that include Tyrannosaurus rex and Velociraptor. n p tn th p A r n h a e n r a n tn r fossil th p \"National Geographic will continue to support efforts to study it fully.\" A group of scientists has confirmed that the fossil specimen known as Archaeoraptor is a combination of at least two different animals. They based their finding on a comparison of the fossil with that of a new predatory dinosaur from China. The two fossil specimens were compared and scrutinized on Tuesday, April 4, by a panel of paleontologists and ornithologists, headed by Hans-Dieter Sues, vice-president of collections and research at the Royal Ontario Museum. Sues also is a member of the National Geographic Society's Committee for Research and Exploration. The team concluded that the specimen is a composite of at least two different animals. The tail clearly belongs to the small predatory dinosaur, a dromaeosaur. The left and right femurs are part and counterpart of each other, as are the other leg bones, but the bones may represent a combination of several specimens. The trunk region, shoulder girdle, forelimbs and skull of the Archaeoraptor specimen do indeed represent an animal new to science. This animal may have implications for the early evolution of birds, but its relationship to other primitive birds has not been determined, Sues said. The Archaeoraptor specimen, unveiled at a National Geographic Society news conference last October, was originally believed to be a key species representing the evolutionary transition from dinosaurs to birds. NARRATOR: Scientists said it was the missing link that supported one of the most controversial theories in modem palaeontology. LEWIS SIMONS : This is enormous. I mean for anybody who has devoted their, their life to this science it's hard to imagine anything that could be more important. NARRATOR: Yet when they examined it they found, buried within it, something they had never expected. no that I could see it cross lit and there were a number of beautiful teeth in this skull and that was very exciting and then we studied also the tail that was a dinosaur, very dinosaur-like tail. PETE LARSON: I got this incredible high feeling like climbing to the top of Mount Everest. It is the, the feeling of discovery, that wonderful time when everything clicks into position. NARRATOR: Both McGovern and Larson thought they could be looking at one of the most important fossils ever found, a specimen that would prove, beyond doubt, one of the most controversial theories in all of evolution: that dinosaurs had evolved into birds. The idea that something as graceful and slight as a bird could have come from a dinosaur is one of the most extraordinary ideas in evolution. Dinosaurs didn't have feathers, they didn't have wings and they couldn't fly. The theory goes back to the mid-1800s when Thomas Huxley, one of Darwin's most fervent disciples, examined a strange looking fossil called Archaeopteryx. It looked to him like a dinosaur, but it had one feature never seen on a dinosaur before: feathers. DR PHILIP CURRIE : Clearly looking at the skeleton we have a dinosaur, it had a long tail, it had teeth in the jaws, rt had three clawed fingers, it had three toes. The only thing that identified it as a bird were the feathers. NARRATOR: But this was good enough for Huxley. Basing his ideas heavily on the existence of the feathers, he argued that Archaeopteryx was a half bird, half dinosaur. He then advanced an extraordinary theory: birds must have evolved from dinosaurs. To many in the field it seemed to show one of the great wonders of evolution. PHILIP CURRIE: As far as I'm concerned Archaeopteryx is one of the most important scientific discoveries ever made. When it was discovered it was quite clear right from the beginning that you had this combination of characters and it showed a bridge between birds and dinosaurs. NARRATOR: Yet the theory is very controversial and many scientists think Huxley simply got it wrong. One of them is leading bird palaeontologist Professor Larry Martin. PROF LARRY MARTIN : The evidence for bird dinosaurs and this just isn't my conclusion alone. There are a number of people, in fact almost all the people who work on fossil birds agree with me, is that when we look at these characters closely we find the evidence that birds are related to dinosaurs is not very solid. NARRATOR: The magazine was already planning an article on the evolution of birds. Now it had a major scoop. The new fossil provided fresh and powerful evidence which would turn the story into a ground breaking report. LEWIS SIMONS: As more and more information came in about this specimen and. and people began to recognise that this might indeed be the missing link and a very important element in the history of palaeontology, in the history of the world, there was a great deal of excitement. LEWIS SIMONS: This is enormous. I mean for anybody who has devoted their, their life to this science it's hard to imagine anything that could be more important. NARRATOR: But excitement was not enough. If the fossil really did answer one of the biggest riddles in evolution the magazine had to be 100% sure of its facts. BILL ALLEN: It's not ail that unusual for us to go to extraordinary lengths to verify things that we have in the magazine, but when there is something that is also has the potential of being such a ground-breaking fossil you want to make sure, so you try and get the best people that you can and have, have the work done. NARRATOR: The magazine agreed to fund the scientific analysis of the fossil in return for exclusive press coverage. It turned to some of the best people in the business. The fossil was about to undergo the most thorough investigation modem science could throw at it. Dr Philip Currie is one of the world's top palaeontologists. He's spent a lifetime scouring remote comers of the world in search of dinosaur remains. For him the new fossil promised the end of a lifelong search for Huxley's missing link and the opportunity to learn more about one of the most intriguing groups of animals ever to roam the earth. PHILIP CURRIE: People like dinosaurs. I mean you get fascinated by them when you're very young, you think they're wonderful animals. Kids I think love dinosaurs because they represent so many superlatives. They're the biggest animals, the heaviest animals, the most bizarre animals and they ruled the world for so long. NARRATOR: Currie now became the most influential member of the investigative team. Every fossil find is normally accompanied by a set of explanatory notes listing where and how it was collected, information which will help date and authenticate it, but the new fossil had none of this. PHILIP CURRIE: The scientific process includes not just the collection of nup-./Avww.ooc.co.uK/science/nonzon/zuui/amoiooitrans.sntmi 31/UVU3 specimens, but also the collection of data and that data collection is very, very important to scientists. Sometimes the data is more important than the specimen itself, so when you acquire a specimen where you don't have information on who collected it, where it was collected exactly, how it was collected, there's no photographs, there's no field sketches, then you have to be a little bit more suspicious. NARRATOR: Without the usual background notes this was going to be an unusually difficult specimen to interpret. All they had to go on was the fossil itself. To make it easier to see specialists were employed to cut away the background rock and expose the skeleton. Currie needed to know the shape and size of the bones and how they all fitted together. Only then would it be possible to judge what sort of animal this really was. PHILIP CURRIE: We felt that we had to know what was going on and so we examined all the different pieces of the specimen to see how they went together and whether in fact we had contact between the front and the back of each bone. The work was made more difficult because the fossil had been badly fractured when it was taken out of the earth. The examination took several months, but as they slowly peeled away the surrounding rock the ghost of the pieces of the skeleton began to emerge. There was a bird-like head, the body and arms were also unmistakeably those of a bird, but the legs looked as though they belonged to a dinosaur-like creature and the bones of the tail were fused together to form the short, rigid tail typical of a ground living dinosaur. Their best guess suggested it was a bird-like creature from the pelvis up and a dinosaur from the pelvis down. They called it Archaeoraptor, or ancient hunter. In Washington the deadline for the article was approaching, yet with the scientists still uncertain exactly how the different parts of the skeleton fitted together National Geographic agreed to fund further research. LEWIS SIMONS: I can tell you as, as a journalist who's done other stories for the magazine that the, the fact checking at National Geographic is absolutely the most rigorous I've ever been put through. They go to the most extraordinary lengths to check out the authenticity of virtually every word that appears in the magazine. NARRATOR: With only weeks before publication, the Archaeoraptor was booked in for one of the most sophisticated examinations currently available to palaeontology. In August 1999 it arrived at the CAT scan laboratory of the University of Texas. It's arguably the best equipped palaeontology laboratory in the world. Here equipment used for probing the human body has been adapted for use on fossils. It's run by Professor Tim Rowe who has built a pioneering reputation for his work. The technology allows him to build a digital model of a fossil so that each and every bone can be clearly seen. PROF TIM ROWE : It's as if you had a loaf of bread and you stacked the loaf of bread up and one by one by one you were slicing it up, so we can see the specimen from inside out as if we'd physically cut it open, but the process is entirely non-destructive. NARRATOR: The first thing Rowe produced was an overall image of the fossil, a hazy ghost-like picture. He then digitally enhanced it so that the skeleton was clearly visible. TIM ROWE: What we have here is a very interesting specimen. Here's the skull. This is the tip of the snout here and the brain case is here and the skull is twisted back in a rigor mortis posture. This means is that the top is here, the bottom is here and here is the neck. It's twisted back in this characteristic death posture that many fossils exhibit and it's lying on its back with one arm over itself, the other arm off to the side. Here's the shoulder, here's the elbow, here's the wrist. The wrist is cocked, looks like this animal had wings and yet we see a little, tiny m ip ://www.DDc.co.uK/science/nonzon/zuui/ainoioourans.smmi bone, the knee, there's the shin, here's the ankle, here's the foot and the various toes have slightly come apart down here and then finally juxtaposed against that is this tail unlike any other bird tail, tail that had only been seen in a non-flying dinosaur. That was startling, it was very unusual to see this combination, of characters and we wondered well, what's going on here. NARRATOR: Rowe was keen to find out more about this curious creature, but the investigation, as far as National Geographic was concerned, suggested the Archaeoraptor was everything that was claimed for it. In Autumn 1999 National Geographic published its article in a blaze of publicity. BILL ALLEN: The fossil of Archaeoraptor found its way from China to Utah and fortunately it did end up in the care of people whose knowledge of dinosaurs helped them quickly realise what a find it is. It is a true missing link between dinosaurs and birds that could fly. LEWIS SIMONS: Here was the missing link. There's, there's no better term for it. This was going to, to rewrite palaeontology, was going to rewrite history, it was going to, it was going to say to the few sceptics out there that all your doubt about birds evolving from land-bound dinosaurs are now worth nothing. NARRATOR: A 150 year old riddle seemed to have been solved. Yet on the other side of the world something even more extraordinary was about to unfold. Xu Xing is a Chinese palaeontologist who specialises in dinosaurs. He'd been at the National Geographic press conference in America and been fascinated by what he saw. XU XING : When I came back from the US I was very excited because I'd seen an important fossil that had come from China. It was a very significant specimen and I wanted to know a lot more about it. NARRATOR: Xu Xing knew that if he could find another specimen he might be able to learn more about this mysterious creature. It had come from the Liaoning region in Northern China, one of the richest fossil areas in the world. The rock here is formed by layers of volcanic ash which over 130 million years ago buried a wetland that had teemed with wildlife. It's created perfect conditions for preserving even the most delicate creatures. XU XING: We've discovered a huge number of fossils: dinosaurs, birds and others. They are very common in Liaoning province. They are all fantastically well preserved. Some have got skin on them still. In some cases even the intestines and internal organs have been preserved. These are incredibly precious and rare specimens, saved by the unique nature of the rock here. There are a large number of them. NARRATOR: Xu Xing now began to search the area. It's peppered with dig sites. The search dragged on for two months, it was like looking for a needle in a haystack, but nobody had seen anything like the Archaeoraptor. One of the best sources of information is local farmers who are paid by China's geological institutions to spend up to six months of the year digging and sifting rock. XU XING: I contacted farmers and asked if they'd seen anything with the body of a bird and a tail of a dinosaur. A lot of them have got private stores of fossils and I thought maybe we'll be lucky and somebody will have something similar. NARRATOR: But again nobody had seen anything. Xu Xing kept moving. He even scoured some of the disused dig sites. The search was going nowhere, but then he got a message. XU XING: I heard from a farmer that he'd found something similar to Archaeoraptor, so I went to his house. It was very exciting. n itp ://www.DDc.co.uK/science/nonzon/zuui/amoiooitrans.sntmi J i/u v u i NARRATOR: Life in the region's villages is harsh and many farmers don't just dig for fossils, they've become amateur dealers. They've been responsible for bringing to light a number of important finds. Xu Xing was directed to a small house. Here, in a dark room, on a pile of wooden boxes, the farmer had laid out a small and cracked specimen. There was no head and upper body and yet it seemed to look similar to the Archaeoraptor. As far as he could see with the naked eye it had the same dinosaur-like tail. He could just about make out the trace of a feather. It looked very promising, but it would need more detailed examination. Back in Beijing Xu Xing headed for his laboratory. Here he compared his new find with photographs of the Archaeoraptor specimen in America. The more he looked, the more the two specimens looked alike. The new fossil was very incomplete, but what there was suggested he really had found another Archaeoraptor. XU XING: This is a picture of the Archaeoraptor. When I compared it with the tail of the new fossil they were a very similar length. The new fossil had a slightly longer tail than the Archaeoraptor's, but we knew something was missing from it. When you allow for this the tails looked very similar. NARRATOR: In fact the tails were virtually identical except for the missing piece from the National Geographic specimen. The more he looked the more uncanny the match appeared to be. XU XING: There is a crack along the tail of the new fossil. You can see that there is a very similar crack along the Archaeoraptofs tail. NARRATOR: The crack ran beside both tails in exactly the same place and for exactly the same distance. It was even the same width. There was something else, too. XU XING: Both the slabs have also got an identical yellow dotted line running beside the tail. NARRATOR: It was the same yellow stain on both fossils and it was in the same place. Xu Xing realised he'd almost certainly stumbled on something much more than mere coincidence. The rock in this region of China is made up of hundreds of layers of tightly compressed sediment. As it's dug up it splits apart. When this happens fossils trapped in the sediment can split down the middle, some bones sticking to one side of the fracture, some to the other. Some even split in half attaching to both sides of the fracture. The two pieces are known as the slab and the counterslab of the fossil. XU XING: There are a series of small and even holes along the two sides of the tail. Some are concave, some are convex. They are the results of the rock splitting in two and if you put them together you will find they are a perfect match. NARRATOR: It seemed an extraordinary piece of luck. The two tails didn't just look the same, they were the same. It was one tail split down the middle. XU XING: The evidence was overwhelming. I was now 100% sure that the two tails had come from the same fossil. NARRATOR: By an almost unbelievable coincidence Xu Xing had found not another Archaeoraptor, but the counterslab of the National Geographic specimen. Yet as he moved up from the tail to the pelvic region there was something very mysterious. The pelvises of the two fossils should have been identical, but they were completely different. The Archaeoraptor's was small and damaged. The new fossil's was large and intact and showed two hind legs which were very different from the Archaeoraptor's. It made no sense. He compared them again. The photos of the Archaeoraptor showed a clear fracture between nttp:/Avww.DDc.co.uK/science/nonzon/zuui/amoiooitrans.sntmi the tail and the pelvis which didn't exist on the new fossil. As Xu Xing studied the two specimens an awful realisation dawned on him. There could only be one explanation. Somebody had glued a different head and upper body onto the tail of the National Geographic specimen. It was a fake. Xu Xing emailed National Geographic in Washington. XU XING. I'm very sorry to tell you that I am now 100% certain that the fossil you have is a composite made from more than one specimen. NARRATOR: The news of the fake came as a thunderbolt to National Geographic. Could it be that the most popular educational magazine in the world had got its facts wrong? The magazine had never faced such humiliation in its 113 year history. BILL ALLEN: My first reaction was not necessarily disbelief, but... Wart a minute. It was disbelief, it was total disbelief. LEWIS SIMONS: Allen was beside himself. He was furious, he was livid, he was hurt, he was angry in ways that, that are almost unimaginable because it wasn't as though they just buried this somewhere in the back of the publication. It was a big, important story and now he's been told you've been had. NARRATOR: Allen's first instinct was to question whether Xu Xing could possibly be right. How could the magazine, after so much costly checking by some of the best brains in the business, have made such a mistake? He asked the magazine's advisers to urgently recheck their research. At the University of Texas Tim Rowe had continued to examine his data. The fossil had always puzzled him and the CAT scan had thrown up some serious questions about how the fossil fitted together. TIM ROWE: I'm going to show you two slices. The first is this slice here through the skull and these other elements here and the second slice would be back through the ankle and through the tail, through this critical region here, through one of the legs and when we go to these slices here's what we see. Here's the skull and you can see the skull is part of this upper layer of shale and with this you can see the fracture pattern here. Here's a very tight fractures that fit together, here a pair of curved fractures, one fitting against the next. A straight fracture, the pieces on either side are the same thickness, they're the same density, but when we get out here to the very edge of the block this piece is a little bit thicker than the piece it's glued against. It's also a little denser than the piece it's glued against. Now as we move down to the tail, to the critical area, we can see that it's completely surrounded by grout and that there are no natural ties between the tail piece and this piece to the right or this piece to the left. In fact it's just swimming in this ocean of grout here and as we map through the entire specimen we found that there were no verifiable fits between the tail and any of the other parts anywhere else in the specimen. The scan clearly showed what the naked eye couldn't see. There was no natural skeletal link between the all important tail and the rest of the fossil. It had simply been glued on with grout. Rowe says that he'd long suspected the fossil was a fake, but for reasons that are not clear to this day, the message had never got through to National Geographic. Rowe now put all his data together. It wasn't just the tail that had been tacked on to the fossil. TIM ROWE: W e saw that the thigh bone had been glued in. Then the two shin bones, or the tibias, had been glued in and as we looked at these more carefully we could see that one was a slab and the other was the counterslab of the same specimen. It was a single, it was a single leg bone that had been split and both halves had been glued in to make it look as though right and lefts were naturally present and the same was also true of the feet. The feet are mirror images of one another. They'd been split and glued in. It's a single foot, but it had been glued in to make it look as if it were right and left feet and there was a boundary n itp ://www.DDc.co.uK/science/nonzon/zuui/amoiooitrans.smmi ii/ u v u j pieces that fit very tightly together were juxtaposed against pieces that didn't fit very well together. NARRATOR: Scientists now constructed a model of how the fake had been put together. The head and upper body were from an unknown bird-like creature. The tail came from a small, unidentified dinosaur and the shin bones were almost certainly from yet another animal, again unidentified, and the feet were probably from a fourth. The scans had confirmed Xu Xing's finding. The Archaeoraptor was indeed a fake. Across America National Geographic faced a very public barrage of embarrassing headlines. The magazine blamed its advisers for letting it down. BILL ALLEN: It's a question of betrayed trust in many ways. When you have scientists who are considered the best in the world in their field, you work with them in a collegial fashion you expect straight answers. We had had no indication of any problem from the scanning. We'd had no indication of any problem from anyone who had looked at the preparation and we had no indication of any problem from the scientists that we were relying on as well. NARRATOR: Currie remembers things slightly differently. PHILIP CURRIE: Clearly there was a bit of a problem with communication where we were saying things that weren't always picked up and yet we thought they were being picked up. NARRATOR: But one thing Currie did make clear was his regret at ever getting involved in the project. BILL ALLEN: Phil Currie wrote me a personal; letter of apology and said this was the worst mistake of his career. LEWIS SIMONS: Everybody involved was, was trying to make up for mistakes, to shift blame and, and to, to make themselves look as good as possible under a very uncomfortable and disconcerting set of circumstances. In the end, as far as I'm concerned, nobody looked good. NARRATOR: The scientists faced a double embarrassment. The fake had thrown into question the whole idea of a relationship between birds and dinosaurs. An important evolutionary theory had been rocked to its core. PHILIP CURRIE: The whole debate about the origin of birds from dinosaurs has reached monumental levels in recent years and the amount of publicity for it has been quite amazing and I think that when this mistake, so called mistake, was realised of course people who didn't want birds to come from dinosaurs were able to exploit that and say they'd finally got victory. LARRY MARTIN: The effect of Archaeoraptor has largely been just simply to demonstrate that people that believe strongly in an idea can be easily fooled and as a result of that it becomes far more credible that they have made a lot of mistakes. That has a huge effect on the credibility of people who say that birds are dinosaurs. NARRATOR: One of the grandest theories in evolution was firmly back in the file marked 'unsolved'.

Willis Stovall . Although hired to teach geology, Stovall lost no time in undertaking field work and generating interest in vertebrate paleontology among both students and faculty. In 1930, he was called in to salvage the skeleton of a huge Cretaceous fish, Xiphactinus audax, discovered in the Austin Chalk of Collin County, Texas ; a second skeleton was collected nearby in 1932 and sold to the University of Texas. Field work in 1931 included collecting from Lower Permian outcrops near Wellington, southwestern Cotton County, Texas, and from the Triassic near Big Spring, Texas; the latter trip resulted in the recovery of a phytosaur later designated as new . In 1933, a large deposit of mammoth bones was excavated north of Eldorado, in Jackson County, Oklahoma . On these early projects, Stovall was assisted by Llewelyn I. Price In 1935, Stovall received federal support in the form of a depression-relief project to search for, collect, and prepare fossil vertebrates. Sponsorship of the project, which technically was restricted to activities within Oklahoma, came from the Works Progress Administration and its precursors, and continued into early 1942, when WPA was effectively disbanded because of U.S. involvement in World War II. During this time period, the project concurrently employed 40 or more individuals; records indicate that 60,000 to 80,000 man-hours were expended per year. As a result, enormous quantities of fossils from various places in Oklahoma were collected and prepared during this span of about seven years. In its later years, the project was administered by Ralph B. Shead, Stovall's assistant. Various units were organized on a county by county basis, depending on the location of fossil occurrences deemed significant. The major impetus behind the WPA project had been the discovery of Jurassic dinosaurs in the Morrison Formation of Cimarron County. In 1931, road workers discovered large bones about 9 miles east of Kenton, and Stovall had collected a rib and two caudal vertebrae of Apatosaurus at that time. Initial WPA 3 of 7 21/04/00 22:50 The Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of N a .lie c tio n s -Vertebrate Paleontologyhttp://www.snomnh.ou.edu/collections/vertpaleo/catalog/hist_B.htm activities in the Morrison Formation focused on this site , although a number of other sites, mainly on or near the flanks of Black Mesa, soon were developed. Although it was widely rumored that one or more complete skeletons were recovered, almost all the materials were disarticulated. Quarry charts for several of the sites exist, and it may prove possible to reassociate some individual elements. Preparation techniques, necessarily primitive, resulted in surface damage to many of the specimens. Although Stovall's dissertation concerned the geology and paleontology of the Morrison Formation in Oklahoma and he published brief accounts of the dinosaur fauna recently named Saurophaganax maximus , large individuals of Apatosaurus , and the relatively abundant remains of juvenile sauropods . One of the sites produced small bones and a largely aquatic assemblage, including the holotype of a crocodilian . WPA crews in western Oklahoma also collected extensively from Neogene rocks of the Ogallala Group, exposed in the Oklahoma Panhandle and adjacent areas. Excavations at Optima, a somewhat atypical Hemphillian locality , were conducted for a 20-month period during 1937 and 1938, under Berkeley, in 1929 obtained from a railroad cut east of Gould, Harmon County . A WPA unit based at the University of Oklahoma , together with students and staff, collected in central and southern parts of the State, in addition to preparing and mounting fossils sent in by other crews. In 1937 and several following years, this unit collected a number of specimens of the giant caseid pelycosaur Cotylorhynchus romeri from the Early Permian of central Oklahoma . Some of these specimens later were traded to other institutions. Following the discovery, in 1940, of dinosaurs in the Lower Cretaceous Antlers Formation of Atoka County, this unit also collected several notable specimens of archosaurs, including the large theropod Acrocanthosaurus atokensis and partial skeletons of an ornithopod similar to Tenontosaurus tilletti . Stovall resumed summer field expeditions in 1938, when Donald E. Savage, William N. McAnulty, and Wann Langston, Jr., were sent to the Big Bend area of Trans-Pecos Texas. Dinosaurs were collected from the Aguja Formation in what is now Big Bend National Park; exploration of Tertiary rocks in Presidio County resulted in the first significant collection of Oligocene mammals from the area . Stovall and Savage collected additional specimens in Presidio County in 1940 and, from there, moved on to the San Juan Basin, New Mexico, where they collected Paleocene and Late Cretaceous vertebrates, including a partial skeleton of the theropod dinosaur Aublysodon cf. A. mirandus . Accompanied by Langston, they subsequently collected in the Lower Cretaceous Cloverly Formation of Montana, obtaining a relatively complete skeleton of the ornithopod dinosaur Tenontosaurus tilletti, associated with three juvenile individuals of the same species . No collecting data, other than that published, is available for these specimens, a number of which now cannot be located. In 1965, Everett C. Olson reorganized the Permian holdings and added a number of specimens to the collection . Jiri Zidek joined the museum and the School of Geology and Geophysics in 1970. Zidek continued organization of the Paleozoic holdings and, in particular, curated the fossil fishes. He also added a number of specimens from a variety of sources to the collection. Following Zidek's departure from the University of Oklahoma in 1982, Cifelli and Czaplewski joined the museum staff in , respectively. In 1987 , the Oklahoma State Legislature designated the museum as official repository for natural history specimens in the State, and the institution adopted the name Oklahoma Museum of Natural History. Approximately 13,000 specimens have been added to the vertebrate paleontology collection since 1986. Many of these are Cretaceous microvertebrates, including assemblages from the Straight Cliffs, Wahweap, and Kaiparowits Formations , southern Utah ; Aguja Formation , Texas ; Cloverly Formation , Wyoming and Montana . The casts were re-used to make molds for Dinosaur National Monument in Utah, but by then had reached the end of their useful life. As far as we know, the fossil skeleton of \"Dippy\" is still a must-see exhibit in nine of the world's greatest natural history museums. Science now has new information about the behavior of Diplodocus. \"Dippy\" is thought to be a browser of understory plants, so our replica's neck will be more horizontal than before. The long tail probably balanced its long extended neck, and so the tail will be raised off the ground. The bronze-colored giant who greets the public on Forbes Avenue will be the most lifelike Diplodocus science can create. Topics: For a review of early \"Dinomania\" see: Hugh S.

I -,-. -..Z-..-species currently known as Chaetomys subspinosus and Coendou insidiosus; a third species based on type material in Berlin, Coendou nycthemera, is currently known by its junior synonym, C. koopmani. Below, we explain the history of these specimens and the names associated with them, redescribe their morphological characters, comment on synonyms, and summarize information about geographic distributions. The nucleus of the mammal and bird collections of the Berlin Zoological Museum at its inception in 1810 was a large series of Brazilian specimens donated by Count Johann Centurius von Hoffmannsegg . Most of Hoffmannsegg's material had been obtained by two collectors working in different parts of the country: Francisco Agostinho Gomes, who resided at the town of Bahia on the Atlantic coast and sent specimens to Hoffmannsegg from 1801 to 1807; and Friedrich Wilhelm Sieber, who collected in eastern Amazonia from 1803 to 1812.3 Whereas a correspondent named Beltrao sent the count a few birds from Rio de Janeiro in 1800 , and Joao da Silva Feijo sent some insects from Ceara , only Gomes and Sieber are known to have collected specimens of Brazilian mammals for Hoffmannsegg. According to Stresemann and Muggelberg in sorting, naming, and classifying the mammals and birds collected by Gomes and Sieber, many of which were new species. Although some new mammal names from this material were published by Hoffmannsegg himself and more appeared in Illiger's \"Prodromus\" and in his posthumous-3According to Urban , Stresemann , and Papavero , Sieber arrived in Brazil to collect for Hoffmannsegg in 1801. However, Sieber's first letter to Hoffmannsegg from Pard reported his arrival in Brazil on 16 September 1803 after a 55-day passage from Lisbon. ly printed \"Ueberblick\" , others remained unpublished on specimen labels and in manuscript lists. After Illiger's death in 1813, Hinrich Lichtenstein was appointed ZMB director, a post that he held until his own death in 1857. Unfortunately, any original labels that might once have accompanied Hoffmannsegg's mammal collection were lost or discarded, almost certainly as the specimens were being prepared for exhibition between 1811 and 1814; no handwritten labels from the early 19th century are known to survive. By 1814, all of Hoffmannsegg's mammals had been mounted in lifelike poses and attached to wooden bases for exhibition in the main building of the Berlin university . Printed paper labels glued to the wooden bases gave only the Latin binomial, country of origin, and name of the collector. Thus, when Wilhelm Peters succeeded Lichtenstein as ZMB director in 1857 and began the current numerical catalog of the mammal collection , only this secondary labeling was available to indicate the provenance and nomenclatural significance of Hoffmannsegg's specimens. Specimens that Peters believed to be types were in most cases indicated with asterisks in his catalog . Apparently, Peters did not consistently relabel specimens after cataloging them, nor did he remove them from exhibition. Often, his catalog numbers were simply written on Lichtenstein's old printed labels, which remained glued to the wooden bases . The ZMB became part of the Museum fur Naturkunde in 1889, at about which time the collections were transferred to the present museum building . Sometime after this move, Hoffmannsegg's mammals were taken off exhibit and incorporated into the research collection. During the first half of the present century , many livemounts were remade as conventional study skins with extracted skulls. Specimen data and catalog numbers were then transcribed to modern skin tags, and the same information was also written directly onto each 1997 5 EQUATION ;3 4'0. \"0 YL N C) 8 4.4~C t& QOC o 0 to = CZCC Z 42 CZ o_ W CC)°C A r> » 0 r.", "meta": {"ref_id": "N3214.json"}}

Cuvier, Synetheres F Cuvier, and Cercolabes Brandt, all of which are junior synonyms of Coendou. Husson argued for the retention of Sphiggurus as a valid genus, an opinion followed by Woods , but we agree with Handley and Pine that Coendou and Sphiggurus cannot be meaningfully diagnosed as separate taxa. 14 NO. 3214 VOSS AND ANGERMANN: NEOTROPICAL PORCUPINES1 match in measurements and qualitative characters with the skull of AMNH 134208, a subadult male paratype of koopmani that we took to Berlin for side-by-side comparison. Brandt thought that Hystrix nycthemera might be synonymous with his newly described species, Cercolabes nigricans, an opinion apparently endorsed by Wagner 1844, who listed these names as synonyms. Voss's recent examination of Brandt's porcupine specimens in St. Petersburg suggests otherwise, however. The type and only referred specimen of nigricans, ZINRAS 30, consists of a mounted skin from which the skull has been extracted and lost. The dorsal body pelage, unlike that of any specimen of Coendou nycthemera, includes a sparse coat of long blackish fur, the individual hairs of which are tipped with yellow. The underlying quills are conspicuously tricolored over the crown of the head, nape, shoulders, middle back, flanks, thighs, and sides of the tail; the quills of the lower back and rump, however, are bicolored . The ventral fur is entirely soft, without any admixture of spinous hairs. Our measurements of the mounted skin suggest a head-and-body length of ca. 390 mm, a tail length of ca. 240 mm, and a hindfoot of 65-70 mm. Although the skull of ZINRAS 30 is missing, the external characters described above suggest that nigricans is a member of the Coendou spinosus complex, a possibly conspecific series of populations that extends from Paraguay northeastward along the humid Atlantic coastline of Brazil to Espirito Santo . Although the published type locality of nigricans is indefinite, Brandt stated that the specimen was sent by \"Langsdorff\" , the Russian General Consul at Rio de Janeiro from 1813 to 1820 . While it is plausible, therefore, that the type came from Rio, Langsdorff traveled widely in Brazil and it is now impossible to be certain where it was really collected. Handley and Pine provided excellent morphological comparisons between Coendou nycthemera and other congeners with which it has been or might be confused. Hystrix subspinosa Olfers, 1818 Olfers described this species as \". . . light brown, with short twisted spines changing to harsh bristles behind the middle of the body, very long at the base of the seminaked tail.\" 14 He gave the length of the head-and-body as 141/4 inches, and that of the tail as 9 inches. From other long-tailed porcupines lacking visible dorsal fur, Kuhl distinguished H. subspinosa as having \"undulating spines, resembling seals' whiskers, short and stout on the anterior part of the body, very elongated and slender posteriorly, [where they are] four times larger; fine and straight on the abdomen.

I n femur length, condylo-zygomatic skull length, and bullar width, the differences between F, and F, are of statistical significance, being respectively 3.9, 5.1, and 5.9 times their probable errors. These F, hybrids are therefore nearest the sonoriensis parent in their skeletal dimensions. The F, hybrid generation averages somewhat larger than the F, generation in femur length and condylo-zygomatic skull length, but does not differ significantly in the other skeletal measurements. Compared with the first hybrid generation the third averages smaller in all skeletal measurements, but none of the differences are of statistical importance. No very important effect of heterosis upon body or skeletal size seems evident from the measurements of the hybrids. Only in foot length do the F, hybrids significantly exceed the measurements of both parent stocks. I n all other measurements, both of the body and of the skull and skeleton, the hybrids are either close to one or other parent stock, or are intermediate between them. The hybrids of the seconcl and third generations are different in certain measurements from the hybrids of the first generation, but in no measurement do these hybrids exceed the dimensions of the parent stocks to any important degree. I t is interesting to note that ear length is intermediate between the two parent stocks in all three hybrid generations. I n pelage color the two parent stocks differ greatly, sonoliensis being much paler than rufinzls . The tint photometer readings of the dorsal stripe for red in sonoriensis from Victorville, average 13.02 + .29 units more than in the non-inbred stock of rufinz~s from Buena Vista, and the darkest sonoriensis has about the same readings as the palest ~z~finus. I n the color of the side the two parent stocks also differ greatly, though not quite so much as in the color of the dorsal stripe. I n the reading for recl of the side sono~iensis averages Lee E. Dice 10.34 +. .30 tunits more than ~z~f i n u s . All the other color readings both of the dorsal stripe and of the side show similar striking differences between the two parent stocks. The F, hybrids are nearly intermediate in color between the two parent stocks. This is true for all the colors and for both the dorsal stripe and the side. The differences in average tint photometer readings between the hybrids and either parent stoclr is of great statistical probability for every color comparison. The hybrids of the second and third generations average slightly lower than the first generation hybrids in tint photometer readings of the dorsal stripe but for no color is the difference greater than twice its probable error, and therefore the lo~ver readings are of no statistical importaace. The colors of the dorsal stripe of the F, and F, generations are so nearly alike that they sl~ow no consistent nor significant difference from one another. For the color of the side there is no important difference between the hybrids of the F,, F,, and F, generations for the readings for red and for yellow. I n the colors green, peacoclr, and blue-violet, the F, generation averages slightly lighter than F2 or F,, as s h o~n by higher tint photometer readings. The amount of difference does not exceed 1.22 r+ .28 units for any color, and the differences are in general of slight statistical probability, ranging between 3 and 4 times their probable errors. The F, and F, generations average almost the same in the color of the side. The tint photometer averages show that all the hybrids, both of the first, second, and third generations are intermediate in color between the parent stocks. There is no certain indication of any change in color between the F, hybrids and those of later generations. The colors of these hybrids appear to be a blend of the colors of the parent races, and there is no indication of a segregation of the parental color either in the second or in the third hybrid generations. The characters of size and color distinguishing the subspecies rz~finzu and sonoriensis are shown above to be inherited in a blending manner. According to the theory of multiple factors without dominance, which is currently held by many geneticists to account for inheritance of the blending type, the F, hybrid generation should be more variable than F, and also more variable than either parent. I have therefore calculated the coefficients of variation for the measurements and tint photonieter readings of the parent stocks r u f i n z~s and sonoriensis, and of the first, second, and third hybrid generations. I n body and skeletal measurements, the parent sonoriensis stocl: has, in general, smaller coefficients of variation than the parent rufinzu stoclr . This probably indicates the greater amount of inbreeding to which the sonoriensis stock had previously been subjected. The F, hybrids do not differ greatly from their parent stocks in the variability of body dimensions. Only in body length is there a significant increase in variability in F,. The coefficient of variation of body length is 1.97 xk .61 per cent greater in the hybrids than in the parent r u f i n u s stoclr and 3.50 1 . 6 2 per cent greater than in the parent sonoriensis stock. The differences are respectively 3.2 and 5.7 times their probable errors. I n foot length both sexes of the F, hybrids have smaller coefficients of variation than the parent stocks, but only in the comparison of the feniale F, mice with the parent rzcfinz~s stock is the difference of importance, 1.51 & .27 per cent, a difference which is 5.5 times its probable error. I n ear length the F, hybrids have smaller coefficients of variation than either parent stocl:, but only in the comparison with ?.ufinus is the difference of possible significance, being 1.19 i .31 per cent, a difference 3.8 times its probable error. The F, hybrids show no significant difference in variability from the F, generation in most measurements of the body and skeleton. Only in length of hind foot is there a possible significant increase in the coefficients of variation, which are L e e R. Dice 1.70 t .44 per cent greater in I\", for the females and 1.68 k .61 per cent greater for males, the differences being respectively 3.9 and 2.8 times their probable errors. The coefficient of variation of the body length measurement is 2.40 t .70 per cent less in F, than in F,, the difference being 3.4 times its probable error, and possibly significant. Compared with the parent stocks the F, hybrids are not significantly more variable in any measurement. The I\", hybrids do not differ significantly from F, in the variability of any measurement of the body or skeleton. Compared with the F, generation the I\", is significantly more variable in body length, the difference in coefficients of variation being 3.50 t .65 per cent, a difference 5.3 times its probable error. I 1 1 foot length, however, in which F, was indicated to be possibly more variable than F,, F, is not significantly different in variability from F,. For pelage color the variability, as shown by the coefficients of variation of the tint photometer readings , is nearly the same, both for dorsal stripe and side color, in the two parent stocks, rzcfinzcs and sonoriensis. The F, hybrids do not differ significantly in the variability of the color of the dorsal stripe from either parent stoclr. The coefficients of variation of the tint photometer readings for the several color screens are slightly less in the F, hybrids than in either parent stock, and in no comparison are the differences significant. The side color of the F, hybrids is somewhat more variable than of either parent stoclr. The coefficients of variation of the tint photometer readings for red, however, do not differ significantly between the F, hybrids and either parent stock. For the other colors the coefficients of variation of the F, hybrids exceed those of the parent stoclrs by amounts ranging from 3.4 to 4.0 times their probable errors. Tlle I\", hybrids are less variable in the color of the dorsal stripe than the F, hybrids. The difference between the I?? and I\", hybrids in the coefficients of variation of the tint photometer readings is not significant for the readings for red, and for yellow the difference between the two generations is only 5.29 -+ 1.55 per cent, which is 3.4 times its probable error. For the readings of green, peacock blue, and blue-violet the differences are respectively, 4.7, 5.3, and 4.6 times their probable errors and therefore are of considerable significance. The F, hybrids do not differ significantly Prom the F, mice in the amo~ult of variability in the color of the side. This is true for all of the 5 color screens for which tint photometer readings were made. The coefficients of variation for each color screen are actually somewhat less in the F, hybrids than in the I?,, but the differences are not statistically significant. The 117, hybrids do not differ significantly from the F, in the variability of pelage color either of the dorsal stripe or side. My data fail to show any important increase of variability in the F, generation, as required by the theory of multiple factors. There is, it is true, an apparently slight increase of variability in foot length in F, as compared to I?,, but the variability of bocly length is less in F, than in F, by a possibly significant amount. F o r no other measurement is there a significant difference in variability between the F, hybrids and the I?, hybrids or the parent stocks. 3'01. ", "meta": {"ref_id": "OP312.json"}}

{"text": "The mice of the 2-year age class were aged ' when killed between 79 and 130 weeks. The field-cauglzt mice were caught in the field in the spring or summer and kept in the laboratory until the following spring before being prepared as specimens. The specimens prepared from mice killed immediately after their capture are designated wild-killed. The financial support for the care of the animals, for the preparation and measurement of the specimens, and for the computation of the data has been provided by the University of Michigan through the Museum of Zoology, Faculty Research Fund, and Laboratory of Vertebrate Genetics. The breeding stoclc of mice from each locality was collected within a small geographical area, usually less than a mile in greatest diameter. The attempt has been made to secure 5 to 12 pairs at each locality and to avoid inbreeding in the laboratory in order that the genetic variability of each wild popula-The males in slightly over half of the stocks of these mice average slightly longer in body length than the females. The differences are of no statistical significance except in the stocks 6 Lee R. Dice from Cambridge and Ann Arbor W, in which the males of the cage-bred 1-year age class have on the average 3.05 + 1.00 and 2.23 rt 0.71 mm., respectively, longer bodies than the females. I n the combined measurements of the 1-year age class of all the stocks the males average 0.91 + 0.31 mm. longer in body length than the females, a difference which is 2.9 times its standard error and probably significant. The indication is that the males on the average slightly exceed the females in body length. I n tail length and in ear length there seems to be no signifi- . cant difference between the two sexes. I n foot length the males exceed the females slightly in most though not in all the stocks. The greatest differences are in the stocks from Ann Arbor W and Hovey Lake. I n these 2 stocks the males average, respectively, 0.342 + 0.104 and 0.649 + 0.186 mm. longer in the hind foot than the females, the differences being 3.3 and 3.5 times, respectively, their standard errors. I n the combined measurements of all the stocks the males of the 1-year class exceed the females in foot length by 0.170 + 0.044 mm., a difference which is 3.9 times its standard error and is significant. I n weight the males of the 1-year age class exceed the females in each of the 6 stocks for which weights were taken, and in most of these stocks the sexual differences are statistically significant . The greatest difference occurs in the Sand Point stock, in which the males average 6.05 +-2.01 grams heavier than the females, a difference 3.0 times its standard error. The most significant difference occurs in the Ann Arbor W stock, in whic) the males average 4.54 + 0.77 grams heavier than the females, the difference being 5.9 times its standard error. The smallest difference occurs in the Asheville stock, in which the males average 1.92 + 0.87 grams the heavier, the difference being only 2.2 times its standard error. I n the measurements of the femur and of the skull there are no consistent sexual differences. I n some stocks one sex may exceed the other in certain skeletal measurements by an amount which standing alone would be considered significant, but in some stocks the other sex may average the larger. Likewise in the tint photometer readings of pelage color, both of the dorsal stripe and of the side, the sexes seem not to differ to any significant amount. The wood-mouse, Peromysczu leucopus lzoveboracensis, parallels the deer-mouse, Peromyscus maniculatus in sexual differences. I n both species the males slightly exceed the females in average length of the hind foot, and the males average heavier in body weight. I n the wood-mouse there is in addition an indication that the males slightly exceed the females in average body length. No sexual differences are demonstrated in the other measurements or in the tint photometer readings of pelage color. The differences between males and females in body dimensions are so slight that in comparing the characters of the stocks the measurements of both sexes from each geographical locality have been combined into a common mean. For the determination of possible growth after the first year of age in Peronzyscus leucopus lzoveboracensis there are available only about 20 specimens of the cage-bred 2-year age class in each of 2 stocks: Cedarvale and Moville. A comparison between the body measurements of the 2-year old and 1-year old mice of these stocks fails to disclose any important differences correlated with age. 1 NO . 1 % & : 1 1 . -/ BODY LENGTE 1 TAIL LENGTH 1 HIND N O T 1 -LENGTH . . . . . .

Body length averages greater in the 2-year old mice than in the 1-year old mice in both the stocks, but the differences are small, and the greatest difference in either stock is only 2.1 times its standard error. I n foot length both males and females of the 2-year old mice in both stocks average shorter than the 1-year old mice. The diff'erences, however, are slight and range only from 0.9 to 2.1 times their standard errors, and no reduction in foot length with increasing age is indicated. There is no consistent nor significant difference in tail length nor ear length between the 2 age classes. I n the measurements, also, of the femur and slrull there seems to be no significant difference between the 1-year old and 2-year old mice . I n pelage color there seems to be no important difference between the 1-year old and 2-year old mice . Only in the Cedarvale stock is there a significant age difference in the tint photometer readings of the dorsal stripe for reflected yellow, the 1-year mice averaging 0.90 & 0.23 units more than the 2-year old mice, the difference being 3.8 times its standard error. The readings for green and for peacoclc blue of the dorsal stripe in this stock also average greater in the 1-year old mice, and the differences for these colors are of probable significance being, respectively, 2.7 and 2.6 times their standard errors. The average readings for reflected red and for blue-violet of the dorsal stripe, on the contrary, and for all the colors of the side in this stock do not differ significantly between the age classes. I n the Moville stock there is no significant difference between the age classes for any color reading. I n view of the general absence of significant differences in pelage color between the age classes for most of the color comparisons of these two stocks, the significant difference for yellow in the dorsal stripe readings for the Cedarvale stock is considered unimportant. The failure of these data to disclose any growth in the woodmouse after the first year of life does not surely prove the absence of growth after the first year, for there are few 2-year old mice available for comparison. Nevertheless, if any growth does occur during the second year of life in this species the amount of increase in size must be relatively slight. The correlation between body dimensions and age in the species Peromyscus Zeucopus is shown by these data to be very different than in the related species maniculatus. I n previous studies it has been shown that in two subspecies, bairdii and rufinus, of the species nza?ziczclatzcs growth of most parts of the body and skeleton continues into the second year of life, and that in the subspecies gracilis some parts continue to grow even into the fourth year of life. I n lezccopus, on the contrary, there is no evidence that growth of any part of the body occurs during the second year of life. The effect of captivity on the characters of these mice can be determined in part by the comparison of the cage-bred mice with field-caught mice kept in the laboratory for a number of months before being prepared as specimens. Another useful comparison is of the cage-bred mice with wild-killed mice which have been prepared as specimens in the field or which have been kept under laboratory conditions for at most only a few days. Measurements of field-caught mice which were kept in the laboratory for at least 6 months before being killed are available in 3 stocks: Sawyer, Sand Point, and Ann Arbor W . The largest series of field-caught specimens, numbering 165, is from Sawyer. The other series are much smaller. Wild-killed specimens are available only from one locality, Sand Point, where 66 mice were captured in early May, 1931, and the following week were prepared. These wild-killed mice are indicated by the amount of wear on the teeth to be mature animals, and all of them must have been born the previous year or before. They were prepared in exactly the same manner as our other specimens. The body measurements, however, of these wild-killed mice were made by Philip Allan . . . . . . . . . .

They are therefore not included in the following comparisons. The measurements of the skulls and femurs and the tint photometer readings of the wild-killed specimens were made by the same persons who measured the field-caught and cage-bred animals of this and the other stocks, and all should be strictly comparable. I n body length the Sand Point field-caught mice average 3.24 -+. 0.88 mm. longer than the cage-bred mice of the 1-year age class, a difference 3.7 times its standard error and therefore statistically significant. I n the Sawyer stock, on the contrary, there is no significant difference between the field-caught and cage-bred series. I n the Ann Arbor W stock the cagebred animals average slightly though not significantly the larger. The indication is that the cage-bred mice do not usually differ to an important degree in body length from the field-caught mice. I n tail length the field-caught Sawyer mice exceed the cagebred mice of the 1-year age class by 4.29 + 0.66 mm. Likewise the Ann Arbor W field-caught mice exceed the cage-bred, 1-year class by an average of 5.23 -+. 1.02 mm. These differences are 6.5 and 5.1 times, respectively, their standard errors and are therefore highly significant. The longer tails of these fieldcaught mice are probably not due to greater average age than the 1-year old cage-bred mice, for there is no certain evidence that growth in tail length or any other dimension occurs in this species after the first year of age. I n the Sand Point stock, on the contrary, there is no significant difference between the field-caught and cage-bred series, though the fieldcaught mice have on the average a slightly longer tail. I n 2 stocks out of 3 there is therefore a strong indication that the cage-bred mice aged 1 year have shorter tails than field-caught mice kept for a number of months in the laboratory. I n the combined averages of the 3 stocks the tails of the field-caught mice exceed those of their cage-bred descendants by 1.56 + 0.55 mm., a difference 2.8 times its standard error and probably significant. ............

I n neither foot length nor ear length is there any significant difference between the field-caught and cage-bred mice in either of the 3 stocks compared. The femurs of the field-caught animals average longer in each of these stocks than those of the cage-bred animals of the 1-year age class. The differences are significant for the Sawyer and Sand Point stocks, but not for the Ann Arbor W stock. I n the combined measurements of the femur for the 3 stocks the field-caught animals exceed the cage-bred animals by 0.412 +-0.066 mm., a difference 6.2 times its standard error and significant. The femurs of the wild-killed mice from Sand Point average 0.526 -t-0.123 mm. longer than those of the 1-year old cage-bred mice of this stock, the difference being 4.3 times its standard error and significant. I n bullar width of the skull the field-caught animals of all the stocks average slightly broader than the cage-bred animals, but in none of the stocks are the differences of certain statistical significance. I n the combined measurements of bullar width for these stocks the field-caught mice exceed the cagebred mice by 0.141 -t 0.029 mm., a difference 4.9 times its standard error and significant. The wild-killed mice from Sand Point average 0.237 i 0.051 mm. larger than the cage-bred mice in bullar width, the difference being 4.7 times the standard error and significant. The other measurements of the skull show no consistent and important difference between the field-caught or wild-killed and the cage-bred animals. I t is shown above that our series of wood-mice born in the laboratory have considerably shorter femurs, somewhat narrower skulls , and probably slightly shorter tails than mice caught in the field and kept in the laboratory for a number of months, or than those killed in the field. If we assume these measurements not to be affected by the ages of the animals compared the differences must be due to life in the laboratory. Birth in the laboratory does not seem appreciably to affect any of the other measurements. Whatever the cause of the differences in certain of the measurements between the cage-bred mice and those captured in the field the effect, if due to life in the laboratory, must be produced very early in life, for many of the field-caught mice were quite young when captured. All the stocks of mice seem to be affected by captivity in the same general direction, and the several cage-bred series are therefore assumed to be comparable with one another in their measurements. I n dorsal pelage color the Ann Arbor W field-caught mice have significantly lower average tint photometer readings than the cage-bred 1-year old mice . I n the Sand Point stock, however, there is hardly any difference in readings between the field-caught and cage-bred mice, and in the Sawyer stock the field-caught mice have higher readings than the cage-bred mice, though the differences are not of statistical significance. I n the pelage color of the side of the animal the Sawyer fieldcaught mice averagk significantly higher in tint photometer readings than the cage-bred 1-year old mice . The field-caught mice of the Sand Point and Ann Arbor W stocks, on the contrary, both have lower average readings for the side than the cage-bred mice, though none of these differences are of statistical significance. It seems therefore that there is in general no consistent difference in pelage color between the field-caught and cage-bred mice. The wild-killed mice from Sand Point are much darker in pelage color than either the field-caught or cage-bred mice of the same stoclr. This is shown by much lower tint photometer readings in the wild-killed series for both the dorsal stripe and the side for all the color screens. All the differences are very significant. Although the wild-killed mice were prepared as specimens during the first week of May a t about the same date as the average of the laboratory specimens, they had been exposed to quite a different climate, for they had been outside living under natural conditions, while the laboratory animals, both the field-caught and cage-bred mice, had been living for many months in artificially heated rooms in much drier air, and with an artificial food ration. It is possible that a t some other time of the year the pelage colors of the Sand Point mice kept in the laboratory might approach or match the colors of the mice living under natural conditions. I n May, however, the laboratory mice of this stock are darker in pelage color than the mice living in the field. It should be noted that the wild-killed mice from Sand Point are very close in pelage color to the cage-bred mice from Byron. These two localities are only about 60 miles apart. The cage-bred mice from Sand Point are much paler than those from Byron and the similarity in color between the wildkilled Sand Point mice and the cage-bred Byron mice is believed to be only a coincidence. Although the mice living in the field may not have the same pelage color, at least in May, as those kept in the laboratory, yet the cage-bred mice of each stock have pelage colors similar to those of field-caught mice which have been kept for a number of months in the laboratory. I t may therefore be assumed that the cage-bred mice of the several stocks here described are comparable in pelage color. They are in fact probably more comparable than would be specimens taken in the field a t different localities at exactly the same time of year, for a t the different localities the seasonal pelage changes would not likely be exactly synchronous. I n none of the mice is there any indication of serious stunting or of any other important adverse effect of laboratory life on the characters of the animals. All the stocks of mice seem to be affected by birth and by residence in the laboratory in much the same manner, and the measurements and color readings of the several stocks of the laboratory-bred mice here described are therefore assumed to be comparable with one another. Included among the stocks of Peronzyscus leucopus noveboracensis here described are several from closely adjacent geographic localities. There is thus an opportunity to secure some measure of the variability of these mice within relatively Lee B. Dice small sections of the range of the subspecies. This information is of importance in evaluating the differences between stocks coming from more widely separated localities. I n the following discussion only mice of the 1-year age class are considered. From the vicinity of Ann Arbor 3 distinct breeding stocks of these mice were collected in different woodlots. The D stock comes from about 3 miles to the southeast of the center of the city; the W stock from about 4 miles to the west; and the S t stock from about 4 miles to the northeast of the city. The character of the hardwood forest is similar in each of these woodlots except that at the D station, overbrowsed by domestic stock, there is less underbrush than in the other woodlots. The soil at the St locality is more sandy than at the other two stations. The D and W stocks were each produced in the laboratory from what is believed to have been an adequate number of parents to portray the genetic variability of the wild populations, and there was no inbreeding. The St stock was produced from only 8 parents, and there was some inbreeding during the production of the cage-bred mice. The Ann Arbor D stock differs from the W stock in having a significantly shorter body, shorter hind foot, shorter femur, shorter mandible, shorter condylo-premaxillary skull length, and shorter condylo-zygomatic distance . The differences between the 2 stoclrs in some of these measurements are very considerable, but there is no important difference between the stoclrs in pelage color either on the dorsal stripe or side of the body . The St stock differs from the W stock in having a significantly shorter body, longer tail, shorter femur, shorter mandible, and shorter skull, and is significantly paler on the dorsal stripe for all color screens. Compared to the D stock the S t stock has a significantly longer hind foot, longer skull, greater condylo-zygomatic distance, greater bullar width, and paler color of the dorsal stripe for all color screens. It is obvious from these comparisons that the stoclrs from the spite of the fact that the greatest distance between any 2 woodlots is only about 8 miles. The D stock is the smallest of the 3 stocks in most body and skeletal measurements and the W stoclr: is the largest. The St stock is in general intermediate, but the S t stock exceeds the W stock in length of tail. I n pelage color the D and W stocks are closely similar. The St stock is paler on the dorsal stripe than either of the other stocks, but does not differ from them significantly in the color of the side. The 2 stocks from Posey County, Indiana, also come from closely adjacent localities. The Hovey Lake and Canebrake stations are woodlots which are not more than 3 miles apart. I am informed by Paul Hicliie, who captured these mice, that these woodlots are isolated from each other by a series of open fields in which mice of this species would not be expected to occur. The woods at the Canebrake locality are of deciduous type with a sparse undergrowth of cane, but some mice were trapped in the heavier growth of cane at the edge of the woods. At Hovey Lake the trees are mainly oalrs, with an undergrowth of shrubs instead of cane. The soil a t both stations is black gumbo. The main difference in mouse environments between the two localities is that at Canebrake there is a somewhat thicker growth of vegetation at the surface of the ground. The number of field-caught parents used to produce each of these stocks was adequate, and there was no inbreeding in the laboratory. The Canebralie mice significantly exceed the Hovey Lake mice in body length, tail length, femur length, and condylopremaxillary skull length. Further, the pelage color of the Canebrake mice averages slightly darker than that of the Hovey Lake mice. On the dorsal stripe the differences in color shade, as shown by the tint photometer readings, are significant only in the blue-violet, but on the side of the body the Canebrake mice are significantly darker than the Hovey Lake mice for all color screens. The amount of local variation from woodlot to woodlot shown by these mice both in Michigan and in Indiana is one of the most striking results of the study. Woodlots only a few miles apart shelter mouse populations which differ to a considerable degree in a number of measurable characters. The evidence seems good that the mice of the several woodlots described from near Ann Arbor, Michigan, and from Posey County, Indiana, represent local races or clans which are distinguished by differences in their hereditary constitutions. The paler color of the dorsal stripe of the Ann Arbor St mice as compared to those from the D and the W stations may possibly be correlated with the more sandy soil and correspondingly paler soil color of the St station. Likewise the darker pelage color, particularly of the side of the body, of the Canebrake mice as compared with the Hovey Lake mice may possibly be correlated with the heavier surface vegetation at the Canebrake locality. Evidence is presented elsewhere that in the southwestern deserts the pelage color of the small mammals tends to be correlated with the color of the soil of their habitats, and a similar correlation between pelage color and soil color probably occurs in all regions. No soil samples are available, however, from the stations described in this report, and the causes of the observed differences in pelage color between the several stocks of mice can only be conjectured. The important differences in certain of the dimensions of body and skeleton between the local races of these mice living in closely adjacent woodlots are not correlated with any known differences in the environments at the several stations. The stocks within each of the states, Michigan and Indiana, show a considerable diversity in characters. I n fact, in some measurements the variation within one state may approach the whole variation shown by all the stocks of noveboracensis here described. This is shown more by the tint photometer readings of pelage color than by the dimensions of body or slreleton. I n the tint photometer readings for reflected red from the dorsal stripe, for instance, the Sand Point, Michigan, stock has the highest mean of all the stocks, while the stock from Byron, Michigan, practically equals the lowest mean. Likewise, in the readings of reflected red from the side of the body the Wyandotte, Indiana, stock has the highest mean, and the mean of the Decker, Indiana, stoclc is not significantly different from that of the Byron, Michigan, stock, which has the lowest mean of all. I n body length the Merom stock averages largest among the 17 stocks here compared, but its mean does not significantly differ from the means of some of the other Indiana stocks nor from the means of the stocks from Missouri and from Wisconsin . The Hovey Lake stock is intermediate in this measurement, its mean being less than the means of some of the Michigan stocks. The smallest mean occurs in the North Carolina stock, which differs from the smallest of the Michigan stocks, Byron, by 1.80 + 0.73 mm., an amount which doubtfully may be significant. The stocks fr'om Iowa, Missouri, New York, and Maryland, and several of the stocks from Michigan are intermediate in body length. ", "meta": {"ref_id": "OP352.json"}}

{"text": "For example, if dyad \"A\" was observed 20 times and the heavier animal wins, but dyad \"B\" is observed only 2 times and the lighter animal wins; because o f the number o f entries for '\"A\" vs. \"B\" heavier animals would appear more dominant. To reduce the chance for biased results, repeated observations were removed when constructing dominance matrices. The interaction rate for each dyad was reduced to one interaction -the dominant animal and the subordinant animal. Thus, the unit o f analysis for factors influencing dominance was the dyad, not the interaction rate. If the dominance relationship could not be determined within a dyad, both animals were assigned a \" 1\", effectively canceling any effect o f their interaction on the results. Matrices were also constructed ranking females by age, size , and weight. Data on female reproduction come from field observations o f the number and sex o f young seen associating regularly with a given female. The number of fawns assigned to a female was based on repeated observations across the summer. Only after October could fawns be sexed reliably by the presence or absence o f antler buds. Unfortunately, many female/fawn pairs were difficult to observe this late in the year, and not all offspring were assigned sexes. For 1999, reproduction was determined for does with known surviving young in the late fall. For the year 2000, reproduction was determined two ways: first, by number o f young surviving in late fall; second, by number o f young still alive by early March 2 0 0 1 . 2 0 0 0 /0 1 was an especially harsh winter, with three feet o f snow from mid-December to late February, and it was the only year a large die-off of animals was observed on the E.S.G.R. . By March, only four tagged does still had living fawns. As also noted by , normal field observations resulted in few recorded instances o f aggressive interactions among E.S.G.R. females. Most dominance displays observed were at bait piles. Due to the small size o f female home ranges on the E.S.G.R , many females in the study areas did not come into contact with each other and were never observed interacting. Consequently, dominance results are for dyadic interactions, not population level rankings. Interactions were observed involving twenty tagged females of known ages . There were only inconsistencies within three dyads regarding which animal was dominant and which animal was subordinant. In two cases the animals were of the same age class, and in one the animals were only observed interacting twice, each winning once. Reduced to single interactions per dyad, these females made up 56 dyads and are the data set for the age-based matrix . Fifteen known, interacting females were harvested 2000/01 and their body measurements compared. These 15 females made up 45 dyads and are the data set for the girth, crown-rump, and weight-based matrixes . Female age was the only variable significantly associated with probability of \"winning\" a dyadic interaction . Neither girth, crown-rump, or weight were significantly associated with dominance . As Interactions marked above the diagonal were won by the animal with a larger girth, those below the diagonal won by the smaller animal. Shaded boxes along the diagonal indicate deer with the same crown-rump measurements. Boxes with a \" 1\" indicate the pair was observed interacting. Interactions marked above the diagonal were won by the larger animal, those below the diagonal won by the smaller animal. Numbers on the periphery are individual ID's. Female weight increases from left to right, and from top to bottom. Boxes with a \" 1\" indicate the pair was observed interacting.

Male offspring are generally presumed more costly to conceive and raise than female offspring . If this presumption is true, then females in good condition might best improve their reproductive success by producing strong and healthy male offspring that will be unusually successful in future reproductive competition. , formalized this hypothesis and predicted that dominant females should differentially produce sons in polygynous species. White-tails have a matrilineal social structure, comprising small family groups centered around a female, her yearling female offspring, and fawns of the current year . Research on the importance o f age and dominance to the reproduction o f female white-tailed deer has produced conflicting results. It is possible for females to conceive as fawns, though more common for first reproduction to happen as yearlings. Females can give birth to one, two, three, and very rarely four offspring. Several studies have attempted to relate reproduction to female age and condition . The results, however, have been contradicting. Female condition has been associated with level of fecundity. Well-fed females more often had twins and triplets sex ratio. There are reports that females in good condition produce surpluses of both daughters Verme 1983; Verme 1985) , and sons . I investigated the influence o f year, age, and condition on conception rates for female white-tailed deer harvested from the Edwin S. George Reserve in south-east Michigan. This study was carried out on the E. S. George Reserve in south-east Michigan . The deer population on the E.S.G.R. is managed by an annual harvest, and for four years body measurements, weights, and jaw s were taken from all harvested deer . During the first three years, weight was measured before animals were gutted.

Further, an examination of the Sylvilagus material at the National Museum of Brazil, Rio de Janeiro, suggests that there may exist specific variation from North to South even within the Mata Atlântica, and certainly that there exist numerous species-level taxa within \"Sylvilagus brasiliensis \" east of the Andean foothills. The principal hurdle in assessing and adequately describing this geographic and taxonomic variation is, however, the lack of a holotype for S. brasiliensis, habitual in many species described by Linnaeus. Further, there are no existing syntypes from which a potential lectotype could be selected. There are in fact no name-bearing type specimens associated with this species . A name-bearing type being necessary to objectively define Sylvilagus brasiliensis to ascertain the species limits and taxonomy, in accordance with Article 75 of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature , the purpose of the present work is to establish a suitable neotype, and begin the process of excision of valid biological species from a more naturally circumscribed S. brasiliensis. Morphological data: continuous characters-Cottontails of the genus Sylvilagus tend to be relatively homogeneous morphologically, and the range of intraspecific phenotypic variation in cranial characters among members of the genus so broad as to overlap interspecifically . Hence, we undertook analyses of mensural characters both on cranial and mandibular measurements as well as on mensural characters of lower premolar 3, a key dental feature in delineating species boundaries among Sylvilagus species , and White ; those that were not, or are modified, are defined below . Characters were: GLS, greatest length of skull; POSTORB, width of postorbital constriction; BROSTR and DEPROSTR, breadth and depth of rostrum-these were listed by Ruedas as being measured at plane of extremity of anterior zygomatic process but following the terminology of Wible would be modified to be measured at the anterior extremity of the masseteric spine on the maxillary portion of the zygomatic arch; BBRAIN, breadth of braincase; ZYGO1, greatest width across the masseteric spine on the maxillary portion of the zygomatic arch; ZYGO2, zygomatic breadth; LZYGO, length of zygomatic arch from anteriormost portion of masseteric spine on the maxillary portion of the zygomatic arch to posteriormost extension of jugal spine; NASALL, greatest length of nasal bone; NASALW, greatest width across left and right nasal bones; I2P2, least alveolar length of I2-P2 diastema; P2M3, greatest alveolar length of P2-M3 toothrow; HBRAIN, height of braincase; HBULLA, height of bulla, from ventralmost point of ectotympanic to dorsalmost point of external auditory meatus; CONDL, condylopremaxillary length of cranium; LPALFOR, WPALFOR, length and width of incisive foramina; PALONG, palatal length: from posterior edge of I2 alveolus to posterior extremity of palatal bridge; PALBRDGE, greatest anteroposterior dimension of palatal bridge; BASIOC, anteroposterior length of basioccipital; WIDBULL, width of auditory bulla, measured perpendicularly to the longest axis of the bulla , across its broadest dimension from the most external portion of the ectotympanic to the suture between ectotympanic and exoccipital, about even with the middle of the occipital condyle; ANTBULL, anteroposterior length of auditory bulla, from the most anterior projection of the ectotympanic to the most posterior point between the occipital and the paracondylar processes of the exoccipital; INTBD, least breadth across the basioccipital between the ectotympanic bones; OCCOND, width across the occipital condyles; INTBOC, length between the posteriormost edge of the palatal bridge and the suture between the basioccipital and basisphenoid bones; CHOANA, breadth of choanae-we measured this at the posterior narial opening, at the level of the second molar, hence this is technically the nasopharynx; MASTOID, greatest breadth across the mastoid exposure of the petrosal; DEPZYGO, least anteroposterior length across the maxillary bone at the base of the masseteric spine on the maxillary portion of the zygomatic arch; IP3, least alveolar length of i-p3 on mandibular body; MANDEP, depth of mandibular body below m1; P3M3, greatest alveolar length of p3-m3 in mandibular body; HMAND, height of the mandible from ventral aspect of angular process to most dorsal aspect of condyloid process ; HPTT, distance from ventral aspect of angular process to most dorsal aspect of pterygoid tuberosity; BCON, breadth of condyloid process, below articular facet; LMAND, length of mandibular body, from anterior edge of incisive alveolus to posteriormost aspect of angular process. Dental characters recorded from the third lower premolar included: wpostlof, greatest width of the posterior loph of pm3, wpm3, greatest width of pm3, aplpostl, greatest anteroposterior length of posterior loph of pm3, wantloph, greatest width of anterior loph of pm3, lantloph, greatest anteroposterior length of anterior loph of pm3, lpm3, greatest anteroposterior length of pm3, antlofar, area circumscribed by enamel in the anterior loph of pm3, pstlofr, area circumscribed by enamel in the posterior loph of pm3. Statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Analysis System software, version 6.03 . Similarly, no attempt could be made to determine presence or extent of sexual dimorphism in the taxa examined, although sexual dimorphism has been reported in measurements of Sylvilagus and, given small sample sizes, could affect results of multivariate analyses . Univariate statistics were calculated using the UNIVARIATE procedure of SAS. Two series of multivariate analyses were undertaken, the first only comparing specimens of S. andinus with S. brasiliensis, the second including those two species as well as S. tapetillus. In each instance, a principal component analysis was carried out first on the correlation matrix of the raw cranial data of complete specimens in the species under consideration measured in all the focal species: S. andinus and S. brasiliensis in the first analysis, then those two taxa as well as S. tapetillus, in order to determine whether any group separation occurred using the measurements taken. Such a posteriori grouping methods are preferred over a priori grouping methods because there is no prior hypothesis as to the putative identity of specimens examined. We undertook the principal components in a stepwise manner because we undertook the comparisons in a stepwise manner. For the initial comparison between S. andinus and S. brasiliensis only, given that the analysis is sample dependent, having included samples potentially ascribable to other taxa could have confounded the resulting variation in multivariate space in the direction of an added sample that was not germane to the particular comparison. We were interested first only in assessing whether there was any overlap by S. brasiliensis, of which we currently know of only the neotype , with other putative taxa. In the first instance, that was S. andinus, for which we had a broader sampling for morphological variation. The second, more complete series of principal component analyses, on all three focal taxa of this work, were carried out on the correlation matrix of raw data recorded only from specimens deemed adult based on ossification of occipital sutures and tooth wear, and for which a complete suite of measurements would assure inclusion in the principal component analysis. Morphological data: Discrete characters-Drawings of p3 crown enamel patterns were made by tracing from photographs taken using a Canon EOS 30D digital camera mated to a Canon MP-E 65 mm f/2.8 1-5X Macro Photo lens. Among leporids, p3 generally constitute the most informative dental elements for taxonomic and systematic purposes further noted that although P2 eventually might prove to be diagnostic, adequate descriptive work was lacking for that tooth. Discrete characters were deemed the most important in this particular research; accordingly, resulting figures were oriented and scaled to the same size in linear dimensions to carry out size-independent comparisons of interspecific characters. Characters considered are described in Appendix I of Ruedas ; the presumed plesiomorphic condition is exhibited by Lepus californicus, in the genus hypothesized as sister to Sylvilagus , Palacios et al. , and Erbayeva . Morphological data: Cladistic analysis of morphological characters-We analyzed the morphological data in order to assess the utility of the characters in evolutionary analyses, as well as to determine the distribution of character states across resulting trees. Cladistic analyses were carried out in PAUP* 4.0b10 , specifying Lepus californicus as the outgroup. We used the heuristic search algorithm with stepwise addition to obtain starting trees for branch swapping, specifying the tree bisection-reconnection algorithm to be used for branch swapping, with the addition sequence used in the stepwise addition set to random, and using 100 randomaddition-sequence replications. Bootstrap and jackknife explored 10,000 replications using the same specifications except for the use of 10 random-addition-sequence replications at each search, holding a single tree at each search. An initial analysis was undertaken using the dental characters employed by Ruedas , absent characters xix-xxiii, which are characters of the third upper premolar and were not surveyed in the South American taxa under consideration herein, and one additional character not used by Ruedas : character xxiv, lacunar remnant of p3 paraflexid present or absent . It may be unclear in certain species whether the lacuna on the lingual side of p3, in the area of the metaconid, is in fact formed by a fusion of the anterior and posterior lophs of p3, usually at the central angle, causing the lingual portion of the hypoflexid to become pinched off and perhaps reduced. For example, the latter could certainly be the case in the instance of some of the specimens illustrated by White , including †Alilepus hibbardi, , †A. vagus, , †?Alilepus sp. , †A. wilsoni, , †?A. browni, , †Pratilepus kansasensis, , †Aluralagus bensonensis, , †Nekrolagus progressus, , †Aztlatonolagus agilis, , and Romerolagus diazi, . However, in the specific instance of the character as we describe herein, the specimen of Lepus californicus that we examined had a distinct enamel-ringed lacuna cranial to a fully developed hypoflexid extending from labial to lingual sides of p3, hence is inferred to be a remnant of paraflexid, rather than the lingual aspect of the hypoflexid. We further note that this character may not be present in all specimens of L. californicus . In the first instance, we combined the taxa from the analysis of Ruedas as well as those examined in the present manuscript. That analysis resulted in an unresolved polytomy among Sylvilagus species. We then reduced the taxa to include S. andinus, S. brasiliensis, S. tapetillus, S. dicei, and S. floridanus, rooted by L. californicus. Ancestral state reconstruction was carried out in Mesquite . Once it was demonstrated that this analysis had some resolving ability , a subsequent, expanded analysis was undertaken that included additional taxa and in particular, included the cranial morphological characters used in the diagnoses of S. andinus, S. brasiliensis, and S. tapetillus. The additional characters, again polarized with respect to L. californicus, are as follows: xxv, braincase pitting , absent , present . xxvi, antorbital process present , absent . This character can be considered synonymous with characters 5 of Wible and 130 of Asher et al. : supraorbital notch absent or present , given that a supraorbital notch depends on the presence of an antorbital process. xxvii, postorbital process fused to cranium , free ; we note that although we scored this as plesiomorphic in Lepus, that is the condition exhibited by L. californicus: other species of Lepus display this character in its derived condition, thus additional paleontological material should be examined in order to indubitably ascertain the polarity and distribution of this character in modern and extinct lagomorphs. xxviii, caudal aspect of postorbital process rounded , or sharply pointed . Our characters xxvii and xviii are dependent on character 4 of Wible , which is equivalent to character 129 of Asher et al. : postorbital process present or absent ; we did not use this character because a postorbital process is present in all the Leporidae we examined, hence has no information content. xxix, zygomatic fossa present , absent . This is the character 19 of Wible and 119 of Asher et al. . However, those authors scored it as absent or present . In the present analysis, because a zygomatic fossa, the depression in the anterior zygoma for the lateral masseter, was present in our outgroup, L. californicus, the plesiomorphic condition in the analysis was presence rather than absence. xxx, frontoparietal suture interdigitated , smooth . We considered for this character any amount of interdigitation along the frontoparietal suture as character state : some of the individuals we examined had a smooth frontoparietal suture in the medial half of either suture line, and an interdigitated suture for the lateral portion of either suture . xxxi, frontonasal suture sharp, or V-shaped , broader, or U-shaped ; it is likely that this character may be found, upon broader taxonomic sampling, to constitute extremes of a continuum. For the taxa under consideration herein, however, this character is consistently binary. xxxii, nasal process of frontal long or short . In species of lagomorphs, there is variation in a process extending facially from the frontal bone between the posterodorsal process of the premaxillae and the nasal bones. This nasal process may be short or absent , or extremely long, up to a third of the length of the nasal bone. xxxiii, single or multiple foramina in the basisphenoid bone. In the plesiomorphic condition, the basisphenoid bone is pierced by a single aperture, the craniopharyngeal canal . The craniopharyngeal canal, a developmental remnant of the connection between the roof of the pharynx and the developing pituitary gland , can be identified by its orientation: running obliquely in a posteroventral to anterodorsal direction, and is generally the only opening present in the basisphenoid of lagomorph species, or the principal opening. Additional openings in the basisphenoid, possibly fenestrae rather than foramina, may be present and appear to be consistent at the intraspecific level. J. H. Wahlert noted with respect to this character that the more anterior perforations also have been identified as the craniopharyngeal canal . The precise identity of the perforations in the basisphenoid therefore bear further scrutiny. Lastly, character xxxiv: premolar foramen absent , present ; this character is extensively detailed in the main text of the present work.

Brazil: Rio de Janeiro, Porto Real. Naturalis , two uncatalogued specimens, coll. H. du Dréneuf, 1890 , coll. H. du Dréneuf, 1892 . Molecular data-The analyses are based on sequences from the mitochondrial 12S ribosomal and cytochrome b loci as used in previous studies investigating the phylogeny of Leporidae , following the manufacturer's recommendations. Primers used for amplifying and sequencing 12S rRNA were 12C and 12G , and for cyt-b were CytB1F and CytB5R . 12S rRNA polymerase chain reaction program consisted of an initial denaturation of 94ºC 3 min., followed by 35 cycles of 94ºC 40 sec., 42ºC 2 min. and 72ºC 3 min, ramping 1°C/sec, and final extension 72°C for 30 min. Amplifications were carried out in a total volume of 50 μL with about 30 ng of DNA, 10X buffer, 6 ng/µL of each primer, 0.5 mM of dNTPs, 5 mM of MgCl 2 and 1.25 U of Taq DNA polymerase . PCR program for amplification of cyt-b fragment comprised an initial denaturation 94°C 3 min., followed by 40 cycles of 94ºC 45 sec., 52ºC 30 sec., and 72ºC 1.5 min, and final extension 72°C for 10 min. PCR was undertaken in a final volume of 25 μL with about 30 ng of DNA, 10X buffer, 4 ng/ µL of each primer, 0.1 mM of dNTPs, 5 mM of MgCl 2 and 1 U of Taq DNA polymerase . PCR products from both reactions were purified using 20% polyethylene glycol /2.5 M NaCl solution. Sequencing products were precipitated in an ethanol/EDTA solution, re-suspended in Hi-Di formamide and sequenced with BigDye 3.1 Terminator kit in an ABI PRISM 3730 Genetic Analyzer . Both strands were sequenced to improve accuracy of base calling. Sequence chromatograms were visually inspected and manually corrected using Chromas Lite, v.2.1.1 . DNA also was harvested from dried skin clips for one specimen, Sylvilagus andinus UMMZ 77075, using a modified version of the Fulton et al. and Moraes-Barros & Stenghel Morgante extraction protocols. Hair and the outer dermal layer were scraped from the sample using a sterile scalpel. The skin clips were then sterilized in a 0.5% bleach solution for 30 seconds before three, 1-minute rinses with UltraPure ™ distilled water . The sterilized skin clips were then cleaned and initially rehydrated in 1 mL of UltraPure™ distilled water at room temperature for seven days. The water was replaced each day. After seven days in water, the sample was fully rehydrated in 1 mL of TE buffer for two days with replacement of the TE buffer each day. At the end of the two-day rehydration period, the sample was washed three times in a 0.5 M EDTA solution. Finally, DNA was isolated from the sample using the standard Qiagen DNeasy instructions with the following modifications. Initial digestion conditions included 180 uL buffer ATL, 20 µL of Proteinase K, and 20 µL of 1M DTT. After the ethanol washes, the column bound DNA was eluted into 50 µL of H 2 O. 12S and cyt-b were amplified in 150-350 bp overlapping fragments using primers developed in Primer3 , Sylv247F , Sylv423F , Sylv747F , Sylv905F , Sylv298R , Sylv590R , Sylv850R , Sylv1012R , and SylvR . 12S primers were as follows: 12sSylvF , 12sSylv305F , 12sSylv535F , 12sSylv232R , 12sSylv663R , and 12sSylvR . Amplifications of each fragment were performed in 12.5 µL aliquots using the following conditions: , 0.75 µL Primer 2 , 3.75 µL H 2 O, 1 µL DNA . Thermal conditions were as follows: 95 ºC for two minutes, 40 cycles of 95ºC for 30 seconds, 45ºC for 45 seconds, and 72ºC for 45 seconds, followed by a final 72ºC, 5-minute elongation. Prior to loading, the thermal cycler was heated to 80ºC per the requirements of the HotStarTaq. Approximately 2 μL of PCR product was visualized on a 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresed at 300 volts for 20 minutes. Successful reactions were purified via QiaQuick PCR purification kits eluted into 50 uL of H 2 O. Eleven µL of purified PCR product and 4 µL of the appropriate sequencing primer were mixed and sequenced using the Power Read service provided by Eurofins Genomics . Sequences derived from the complete mitochondrial genomes of the domestic rabbit, Oryctolagus cuniculus and collared pika, Ochotona collaris were used as references to align our sequences. Reference sequences were 961 and 956 nt , and 1139 nt . We also included new and GenBank sequences as follows, for 12S rRNA: Bunolagus idahoensis, AY292695, U58921, S. floridanus, AY012126, AY292698, new, Texas A&M AK11178, AK114511, S. gabbi , new, Angelo State University Natural History Collections nos. 2328 , 2329 , 2330 , new Texas A&M AK11525, S. audubonii, AY292696, S. nuttallii, AY292697, U63886, S. aquaticus, AY292700, S. palustris, AY292701, U63885. For cyt-b: B. idahoensis, AY292721, S. floridanus, AY292724, S. obscurus, AY292725, S. transitionalis, AF034256, S. aquaticus, AY292726, S. palustris, AY292727, S. nuttallii, AY292723, S. audubonii, AY292722 . Chimeric 12S+cyt-b sequences used the following: B. idahoensis, AY292695 + AY292721, S. floridanus, AY292698 + AY292724, S. obscurus, AK11516 + AY292725, S. transitionalis, AK11525 + AF034256, S. palustris, AY292701 + AY292727, S. aquaticus, AY292700 + AY292726, S. audubonii, AY292700 + AY292726, S. nuttallii, AY292697 + AY292723. To adequately date cladogenic events within Leporidae, for the analysis undertaken in BEAST, we added to the chimeric sequences noted above the following chimeric sequences: Lepus americanus, AY292707 + AY292733, L. brachyotis, AB058613 + AB058616, L. californicus, AY292705 + AY292731, L. capensis, AY292706 + AY292732, L. europaeus, AJ421471 + AJ421471, L. saxatilis, AY292704 + AY292730, L. timidus, AB058610 + AB058607, L. townsendii, AY292703 + AY292729, Oryctolagus cuniculus, NC001913 + AY292717. GenBank accession numbers for the new sequences generated for this paper are listed in Table 1 . Initial alignments were produced using Clustal X, version 2.0 and its default values for alignment parameters. The 12S rRNA gene alignment was further refined following the two-dimensional structure model of stems and loops proposed by Springer et al. . Final alignments were adjusted in Mesquite 3.02, build 681 . Best-fit selection of nucleotide substitution models was based on the Bayesian Information Criterion , as implemented in jModelTest2 version 2.1.6 and model corrected, were calculated in PAUP* 4.0b10 . Maximum likelihood analyses were undertaken on 12S and cyt-b separately, then combined; each analysis used a separate model of evolution elucidated as described above. The ML analyses were conducted using RAxML v. 8.2.4 , which uses a GTR model of evolution. The dataset was initially partitioned for the different loci in order to assess the complementarity between the two data sets: while the 12S rRNA gene shows strong phylogenetic signal among Leporidae, the utility of cyt-b has been questioned at the intergeneric level . We ran 1000 replicate ML searches, assessing clade confidence with 1000 bootstrap pseudoreplicates using the thorough bootstrapping algorithm. Phylogenetic analyses of Sylvilagus taxa were rooted using Brachylagus idahoensis, the presumed sister taxon to Sylvilagus . Bayesian analyses were undertaken using MrBayes 3.2.4 . We ran four independent Markov chain Monte Carlo analyses, each with eight Metropoliscoupled chains, an incremental heating temperature of 0.1, and an exponential distribution with a rate parameter of 25 as the prior on branch lengths. Analyses were run for 100 million generations, with parameters and topologies sampled every 1000 generations. We assessed stationarity and convergence by plotting the -ln L per generation in the program Tracer 1.6 , and dropped samples prior to achieving -ln L asymptote as burn-in. We assessed whether the four analyses reached stationarity at a similar likelihood score and that the topologies were similar, and used the resultant trees to calculate posterior probabilities on a 50% majority rule consensus tree. For molecular dating methods , we used fossil based dates of divergence coupled to a relaxed molecular phylogenetics technique as implemented in the program BEAST, v.1.8.1 , which simultaneously estimates phylogeny and divergence times among the sampled taxa. We used an uncorrelated lognormal relaxed molecular clock model and a Yule prior on the tree to simulate the process of speciation . Operators were tuned in successive runs of BEAST under the chosen model of evolution, with slight changes to the scaling factors until the Effective Sample Size for each parameter exceeded 200 . When optimum operator scaling was achieved, we re-ran the analysis for 20 million generations. Burn-in was assessed based on having reached a stable negative log likelihood , and trees prior to reaching an asymptote discarded from the beginning of the run; all samples were examined in Tracer to verify an effective sample size exceeding 200 for all parameters being estimated. We initially calibrated our molecular clock analyses using a divergence estimate, derived using fossils, of 47.6 MYA between Ochotonidae and Leporidae. This date was suggested by Benton et al. based on the rationale that the fossil material described by Rose et al. was referable to Leporidae. This latter taxonomic assignation we feel is not justified at this time: the robust Shanghuang taxon is located within the Rose et al. phylogeny based on a single calcaneus, resulting in six characters being represented in a data matrix of 228 characters, or 2.6% representation; their gracile Shanghuang and Vastan lagomorphs' taxonomy is based on two calcanea and a single talus resulting in the presence of 20 of 228 characters, or 8.8% representation in the data matrix . Notwithstanding, the first occurrence of Ochotonidae is definitively documented in the Eocene, specifically the Uintan North American faunal stage, 42-46.2 MYA , and †Litolagus, 33.9 MYA . Given the foregoing uncertainties, combined with the long branches and rate variation in the matrix, as well as the fact that we were fundamentally interested in timing cladogenic events within Sylvilagus, the final analyses in BEAST were conducted using Sylvilagus, Brachylagus idahoensis, and Oryctolagus cuniculus, with Lepus as the outgroup. The 19 taxon analysis relied on two fossil calibration points: basal diversification of Sylvilagus at 4.4 million years ago , and basal diversification of Lepus at 4.5 MYA . Justification for assigning that age to Sylvilagus is presented below [see: Restoration of Sylvilagus andinus ]. Assignment of Lepus to that age is more controversial. The oldest undisputed Lepus fossils date from the Blancan to Irvingtonian transition in North America and Middle Pleistocene of Kenya . Dawson listed a fossil record for Lepus of Pleistocene of Eurasia, North America, and Africa, with possibly a Mid-Pleistocene origin from †Nekrolagus. Older assignments remain problematic: a Barstovian age, for example, is based on a single astragalus \"similar to that of Lepus\" in the Rosamond Series of the Upper Miocene .

{"text": "As a consequence of the foregoing, including morphological, molecular, and chromosomal data, we suggest that Thomas' hypothesis that Sylvilagus tapetillus in fact constitutes a species distinct from S. brasiliensis is not currently falsifiable and should stand. Statistical analyses The main distinguishing feature is, as noted, size. The principal component analysis including the holotype-and only known specimen-of S. tapetillus and comparing it with the specimens of S. andinus and S. brasiliensis support this important distinction. As in the previous principal component analyses, PC 1 is size based ; the large neotype of S. brasiliensis and small juveniles of the S. andinus series at either end of the distribution in multivariate space of PC1 support this hypothesis. The distinction in principal components between S. andinus, for which a somewhat larger sample is available, and S. brasiliensis on the one hand, and S. tapetillus on the other is on the basis of the shape-based principal component 2. That component is loaded heavily on interorbital breadth , and width of alisphenoid constriction and incisive foramina ; dentary toothrow to some extent also contributes to this PC . The measurements of these characters in S. tapetillus can be confirmed to be somewhat divergent from those of S. andinus and S. brasiliensis: S. tapetillus, despite its small overall size, has the broadest interorbital breadth among the specimens examined for this work. The alisphenoid constriction of S. tapetillus is, in contrast, the smallest among the specimens measured. Similarly, the width of the incisive foramina of S. tapetillus is equal to those of S. andinus UMMZ 77077 and UMMZ 77078, which we consider subadult and young adult based on fusion of cranial sutures, and only 70% that of the adult neotype of S. brasiliensis. We further note that all the S. andinus specimens have much narrower incisive foramina than the neotype of S. brasiliensis, adults averaging 4.91+0.47 mm, in contrast to 6.4 mm in S. brasiliensis. Hershkovitz suggested that the holotype of S. tapetillus also was not an adult and explicitly compared it to Field Museum of Natural History no. 26877, a young female from Teresópolis, Rio de Janeiro , noting that there were strong overall similarities in size. While we caution that we have not NHMUK 1892.11.24.3 . Among the specimens examined, the first three principal components together account for 90.8% of the variation . Results of this principal component analysis are graphically summarized in Fig. 26 . Character abbreviations as in Table 1 examined the FMNH specimen firsthand, there are mensural discrepancies between the measurements provided by Hershkovitz and those we took from the holotype of S. tapetillus. In particular, the length of the nasals for FMNH 26877 was listed as 21.5 mm, to 25.3 mm for the holotype of S. tapetillus, the mean of adult S. andinus for this dimension is 25.18+3.16 mm, contrasting with 31.4 mm in the neotype of S. brasiliensis. Similarly, alveolar length of maxillary toothrow was reported by Hershkovitz for FMNH 26877 as 11.1 mm; we recorded this dimension as 13.0 mm in the holotype of S. tapetillus. The mean of this dimension in adult S. andinus was 12.40+0.89 mm, the same measurement in the neotype of S. brasiliensis was 14.6 mm. Thus, the proportional differences in mensural characters between the holotype of S. tapetillus and the specimen identified by Hershkovitz as a young adult, FMNH 26877, as revealed by the principal component analysis and direct comparison of mensural data, all support Thomas' hypothesis that the holotype of S. tapetillus is an adult, and therefore represents a species distinct from S. brasiliensis. Cranial morphology Sylvilagus tapetillus: diagnosis. Sylvilagus tapetillus is distinguished from other species of Sylvilagus by the following combination of characters: cranium extensively pitted with minute, shallow pits; pitting extending through frontal bones rostrally well into interorbital region and along frontal suture almost to antorbital region; antorbital process present only as an emargination rather than a process; narrow, relatively long postorbital process ending bluntly, tightly fused to the frontal throughout caudal half, on the tuberculum frontoparietale; masseteric spine projecting strongly rostrally from anteroventral aspect of zygomatic arch; strongly interdigitated frontoparietal suture, strongly U-shaped, between each frontal and parietal bone; frontonasal suture intermediate between V-and U-shape; short but evident process between posterodorsal process of premaxillae and nasal bones; and premolar foramen absent. Mandible relatively robust dorsoventrally; large, labially located mental foramen, with extensive ventrocaudally oriented trail of minute foramina originating from mental foramen. Crown enamel pattern of third lower premolar relatively simple, with single marked anteroflexid invagination near rostrolingual aspect of anterior lobe; protoflexid marked, with uniformly slightly thick enamel throughout; deep paraflexus with some complexity at terminus and on rostral margin; shallow but distinct hypoflexus with clearly marked mesial and distal hypercones. Sylvilagus tapetillus: general aspects of cranial morphology.-As noted in the diagnosis, aspects of some cranial characters further support maintaining S. tapetillus as distinct. The NHMUK 1892.11.24.3 . Data are reduced to include as many specimens as possible in the analysis. As in Fig. 23 , the clusters of three S. andinus in the leftmost area of the graph are specimens aged by us as immature. Note the divergent position of S. tapetillus along principal component axis 2 relative to remaining Sylvilagus taxa examined. That axis is shape based and mostly determined on the dimensions of interorbital breadth , width of incisive foramina, and width of alisphenoid constriction . skull of the holotype is shown in Fig. 26 . Thomas noted in the description of S. tapetillus that the slender postorbital processes were \"anchylosed terminally to the skull in the type, and merely leaving a narrow foramen about 2 mm. in length.", "meta": {"ref_id": "Ruedasetal."}}
{"text": "This character is shown in the complete perspective of the cranium of S. tapetillus and in detail, in comparison with the neotype of S. brasiliensis in Fig. 27 . The neotype of S. brasiliensis has a postorbital process that is fused to the frontal bone at the tuberculum frontoparietale, near the angulus sphenoidale of the parietal bones. The width of the postorbital process is ca. 2.2 mm and the length of the suture between the postorbital process and the frontal bone is ca. 1.7 mm in straight line distance , the length of the resulting foramen is ca. 4.2 mm. In the holotype of S. tapetillus, as noted by Thomas, the postorbital process is more slender: ca. 1.5 mm, and is in fact tightly fused to the frontal bone. The length of the fusion is ca. 3.2 mm on either side. However, it is not a simple rostrocaudal fusion, as in S. brasiliensis: the caudal terminus of the postorbital process ends on the tuberculum frontoparietale, in FIGURE 26-Views of the cranium of the holotype of Sylvilagus tapetillus : dorsal , lateral , and ventral . Greatest length of skull was not recorded by us due to the fact that the cranium is broken at the occiput, hence that linear dimension is unreliable; however, it was recorded by as 61 mm; zygomatic breadth, 32.2 mm. a laterally oriented fusion ca. 0.7 mm in length. Thus, the postorbital to frontal fusion is in effect L-shaped and inverse L-shaped when viewed dorsally, such that the frontal bone cups the terminus of the postorbital process. The resulting foramina are, as Thomas noted, ca. 2 mm in length. If this degree of fusion between postorbital process and frontal bone results from ontogenetic variation, then the impression of the holotype of S. tapetillus as an adult is reinforced, contra Hershkovitz' suggestion that it is immature. The adult nature of the holotype of S. tapetillus also is reinforced by the fact that the pitting present in the dorsal surface of the skull, as it is in the neotype of S. brasiliensis, is more worn than in the also adult neotype. With respect to the frontonasal suture, this character is more equivocal and subject to population variation. In spite of that reservation, the frontonasal suture of the holotype of S. tapetillus appears to be more V-shaped than the frontonasal suture of the neotype of S. brasiliensis, which we characterized above as having a broadly rounded rostral terminus. Mandibular morphology The mandibles of the pertinent specimens examined for this work are shown in Fig. 28 . In the neotype and referred specimen of S. brasiliensis, there is variation in the size of the mental foramen; the neotype has a relatively inconspicuous mental foramen, the referred specimen, UFPE 470, has a more evident, somewhat longer and slender mental foramen. The mental foramen is small and inconspicuous in the holotype of S. andinus. The holotype of S. tapetillus has a relatively larger, more substantial, mental foramen in both vertical and horizontal dimensions. In addition, the mandibular body of S. tapetillus bears some fenestration, or the presence of numerous pinhole size openings, leading ventrocaudally from the mental foramen toward the ventral margin of the mandibular body. This fenestration is completely absent from the neotype of S. brasiliensis. The referred specimen of S. brasiliensis has some rugosity present in this portion of the mandibular ramus. The holotype of S. andinus has even less rugosity than the referred specimen of S. brasiliensis but is not as featureless in this character as the neotype of S. brasiliensis. Additional pitting is visible in the holotype of S. tapetillus at the rostral edge of the mandibular ramus where it meets the mandibular body. This pitting is absent from any of the key reference specimens examined herein. The relative location of the coronoid process in the holotype of S. tapetillus differs from that of S. brasiliensis in that it is located on the rostral aspect of the mandibular ramus approximately midway between the articular head of the condylar process and the sulcus ascenden; in the S. brasiliensis specimens, the coronoid process is located about a third of the distance down the rostral aspect of the mandibular ramus. The holotype of S. andinus is more similar to S. tapetillus in this character. The anteroposterior dimension of the mandibular ramus relative to its height also appears to differ among the specimens examined: the ratio of width to height of mandibular ramus is 0.34 in S. tapetillus, 0.30 in S. andinus, and 0.29 and 0.28 in the neotype and referred specimen of S. brasiliensis, respectively. Indeed, although the holotype of S. tapetillus has the shortest dorsoventral dimension among adults of the comparative series examined , it has the broadest anteroposterior mandibular ramus: S. tapetillus: 10.3 mm; S. brasiliensis neotype and referred specimen: 10.2 mm FIGURE 28-Comparison of the right dentary bones of : holotype of Sylvilagus tapetillus ; neotype of S. brasiliensis ; referred specimen of S. brasiliensis ; holotype of S. andinus . Images not to scale. and 9.4 mm, respectively; holotype of S. andinus, 10.2 mm. The masseteric line, wherein inserts the superficial masseter muscle, on the ventral edge of the angle of the mandibular ramus, also differs somewhat among the specimens examined. However, it may represent to some extent ontogenetic variation : the neotype of S. brasiliensis has a prominent masseteric line ending rostrally in an ovoid process and caudally in the masseteric and pterygoid tuberosities; the masseteric line and ovoid process are not as prominent in the referred specimen of S. brasiliensis. The caudal aspects of the mandibular ramus are not available for inspection in any of the critical comparative material examined herein. Notwithstanding, the masseteric line is thin but evident in S. tapetillus; in S. andinus, the masseteric line is reduced in size but still evident, but the anterior ovoid process is extremely reduced. The ovoid process in S. tapetillus is manifested as a large, diffuse region in the anteroventral portion of the mandibular ramus, rather than as a discrete process, as in the neotype of S. brasiliensis . A final distinction between S. tapetillus and remaining specimens examined is the prominent vacuity present in the mandibular ramus. A vacuity often is present in the ramus of Sylvilagus specimens. Habitually, it is located in the ventrocaudal region of the angle, however, in the holotype of S. tapetillus, it is large and located in the center of the masseteric fossa. Wible pointed out that there is a small ridge in Ochotona in the same region of the angle as these vacuities are present in S. brasiliensis and S. andinus. One may speculate that in the absence of this ridge, the edges of the vacuity may provide insertion points for a subdivision of the masseter muscle. In S. tapetillus, the vacuity is located at the insertion point of the posterior deep masseter, whereas the vacuities in the ventrocaudal region of the angle are at the insertion of a branch of the superficial masseter . The location and size of the vacuity in the ramus therefore strongly suggests a functional distinction in the masticatory apparatus between S. tapetillus and remaining species examined, and as such may also be phylogenetically informative; a broader population sample will be required to assess more fully the extent and significance of this character. Dental morphology The dentition of S. tapetillus is similar to that of S. brasiliensis, but somewhat simpler. In particular, the third lower premolar has a single anteroflexid, to a double in S. brasiliensis. Specimens of S. andinus show a great deal of variation in this character, thus it is possible that the number of anteroflexida will vary. Both specimens have a slight depression in the area corresponding by homology to the paraflexid, but the paraflexid is absent in both. The thickness of the enamel in this region of the rostral loph differs between the holotype of S. tapetillus and the neotype of S. brasiliensis . The protoflexid of the holotype of S. tapetillus is shallow, and shaped as a somewhat open, shallow V. Above, we characterized the protoflexid of the neotype also as broadly U-shaped. The holotype of S. tapetillus in addition displays enamel of homogeneous thickness throughout the protoflexid, in contrast to the neotype of S. brasiliensis, which tapers from extremely thick on the labial margin of the protoconid, to extremely thin on the labial wall of the protoflexid. The hypoflexid is similar in both specimens, with the rostral margin showing a single central angle and thick enamel, and the caudal margin being constituted by thin enamel and almost devoid of crenellations. The second upper premolar differs between the two specimens in that the mesoflexus of S. tapetillus is shallow and surrounded by thick enamel, contrasting with deeper mesoflexus and thick enamel lingually transitioning to thin labially in S. brasiliensis. The hypoflexus is absent in the neotype of S. brasiliensis but present and shallow in the holotype of S. tapetillus, distinctly isolating a mesial hypercone, which is absent in the neotype of S. brasiliensis. In terms of size of the teeth, the anterior loph of lower premolar 3 of the holotype of S. tapetillus is 2.2 mm in greatest width to 3.1 mm in the neotype of S. brasiliensis, and 1.7 mm in anteroposterior length , to 1.9 mm in the neotype of S. brasiliensis. Both specimens are subequal in greatest anteroposterior length of pm3, 2.6 mm in the holotype of S. tapetillus to 2.7mm in the neotype of S. brasiliensis. The second upper premolar of the neotype of S. brasiliensis is 3.1 mm in width, the corresponding measurement in S. tapetillus is 2.9 mm. It remains to be ascertained how these characters will stand up to the scrutiny of a larger population sample, however, in the absence of such a sample; they reinforce the distinct nature of the two species. Cladistic analysis of morphological characters As outlined in the materials and methods, an initial analysis of the morphological characters was undertaken by combining the taxa from the analysis of Ruedas with those examined in the present manuscript. Because that analysis resulted in an unresolved polytomy among Sylvilagus species, we then reduced the taxa to include the taxa focal to this research, namely: S. andinus, S. brasiliensis, S. tapetillus, and S. dicei, as well as S. floridanus, rooted by L. californicus . Two equally most parsimonious trees resulted from that analysis . Including in the analysis only the aforementioned taxa recovered S. brasiliensis as basal, and a con-sistent sister taxon relationship between S. floridanus and S. tapetillus. The relationships of S. andinus and S. dicei in the analysis were not consistent, and bootstrap and jackknife analyses yielded an unresolved polytomy at the base of an ingroup Sylvilagus exclusive of S. brasiliensis. Ancestral state reconstruction carried out in Mesquite indicated that, for this limited analysis, basal nodes a and f, discriminating between Lepus and Sylvilagus are defined by character xvi of Ruedas , and character xxiv, defined above. The former refers to p3, central angle angled such that an [almost closed] lacuna is formed in the medial portion of the hypoflexid , vs. no lacuna formed by CA in hypoflexid . Nodes d and j, uniting S. floridanus and S. tapetillus, are defined by characters x and TABLE 5-Distribution of character states used in the morphologically based phylogenetic analyses . .

Figure 31-Divergence dates and 95% credibility intervals resulting from the analysis of the expanded 12S rRNA dataset using the uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock method implemented in BEAST . The neotype of S. brasiliensis is denoted by an asterisk. xiii of Ruedas . We expanded the analysis by including additional taxa and in addition, the cranial morphological characters used in the diagnoses of S. andinus, S. brasiliensis, and S. tapetillus. The expanded analysis yielded six equally most parsimonious trees, 56 steps in length, with a consistency index of 0.518 and a retention index of 0.449 . Twenty-four of the characters were parsimony informative. A number of clades were recovered more consistently in this analysis. Dental characters defining clades were covered above. With respect to the additional cranial characters, none supported the generic dichotomy between Sylvilagus and Lepus. Within Sylvilagus, S. nuttallii was consistently recovered as outgroup to remaining Sylvilagus . However, this localization was due to retention of primitive characters rather than the species being defined by any autapomorphy, dental or cranial. A monophyletic clade comprising S. brasiliensis and S. palustris was recovered in all the equally most parsimonious trees, albeit of uncertain affinities. This clade received support from 56% of the bootstrap trees and 70 of the jackknife trees . The group is defined only by dental character xv, reflected angle of p3 hypoflexid not highly reflected, versus reflected in remaining taxa. The cranial morphological characters we used define the clade by their combination rather than any single or multiple characters being consistently derived in this clade to the exclusion of remaining species. All other recovered groupings were not defined by any consistent autapomorphic characters; rather, by the distribution and combination of characters. This included for example the clades comprising S. andinus and S. tapetillus, represented in three of the equally most parsimonious trees, 28% of the bootstrap trees, and 38% of the jackknife trees; {{S. andinus + S. tapetillus} S. dicei}, represented in three of the equally most parsimonious trees, 18% of the bootstrap trees, and 28% of the jackknife trees; and {S. floridanus + S. tapetillus}: two of six trees, 32% of the bootstrap trees, and 36% of the jackknife trees. While the morphological characters we employed, both dental and cranial, served in combination to diagnose the species, few were diagnostic of clades. Additional morphological characters will be required in order to indubitably define the clades based on synapomorphies unique to the constituent species pairs or groups. However, we wish to highlight two findings. First, although S. andinus and S. tapetillus appear as sister taxa in three of the morphological trees, there are no synapomorphies exclusive to this morphological clade, the clade is not supported at a level greater than 50% in either bootstrap or jackknife analyses, and the distribution of characters is such as to lead us to conclusively reject the hypothesis of conspecificity for this pair of species. Similarly, in none of the analyses did S. andinus obtain as sister to S. brasiliensis, thereby highlighting from a morphological perspective the stark taxonomic and evolutionary differences between the two taxa, whose hypothesis of conspecificity is definitively rejected by the ensemble of our data. Molecular systematics of the South American [30] [31] [32] [33] We first undertook analyses of the molecular data on each mitochondrial gene separately. For the 12S rRNA gene, 1070 nucleotides were recovered from the neotype of S. brasiliensis, encompassing the complete gene sequence. The degraded nature of the DNA recovered from the S. andinus specimens proved more problematic, 588 nucleotides in two segments were recovered from UMMZ 77075. The gap between the two segments almost completely overlapped a loop feature from the proposed two-dimensional structure model of the 12S rRNA , which would have rendered alignment in that region difficult. As a consequence, analysis of the 12S sequences was ultimately undertaken on a 660 nucleotide segment of the gene. The model of evolution resulting from jModelTest for the more complete 12S sequence dataset was the GTR+I+Γ . The transition:transversion ratio for the data set was 5.0681, nucleotide frequencies were: A, 0.3744, C, 0.2454, G, 0.1576, and T, 0.2226. The proportion of invariable sites was 0.4240, with rates at variable sites conforming to a gamma distribution with shape parameter of 0.488. For the cyt-b mitochondrial gene, we recovered 1057 nucleotides from the neotype of S. brasiliensis, and 237 nucleotides from S. andinus UMMZ 77075. The model of evolution resulting from jModelTest for the cyt-b data was the HKY with Gamma-distributed among-site variation. The ti:tv ratio was 7.9733 for this marker, nucleotide frequencies were: A, 0.2765, C, 0.3265, G, 0.1199, T, 0.2771. The Gamma shape parameter was 0.186. We also created chimeric species by concatenating the 12S rRNA and cyt-b sequences corresponding to the same species. Since these were from the same studies, it is likely that they correspond to the same individual, hence there should be no doubt as to the taxonomic identity, or about \"creating\" an artificial species by joining sequences from distinct genes.

Articular process of the mandible generally moderately tall and wide, with a moderately broad lower articular facet; coronoid process of the mandible moderately high relative to mandibular length ; entoconid usually present on M 3 , typically vestigial , but occasionally well-developed . The tall, broad, slightly curved humerus has somewhat elongated processes, but it is among the least modified within the C mexicana-group . Comparisons.•Cryptotis phillipsii has the least modified forelimbs of any member of the Cryptotis mexicana-group: it has the smallest forepaws and the shortest and narrowest foreclaws; the humerus is among the longest and least curved; teres tubercle is short, medial epicondyle is short and has a straight proximal edge, and teres tubercle and medial epicondyle are broadly separat-ed. Cryptotis phillipsii also has the longest tail relative to head-and-body-length . There may be a local tendency for some C. phillipsii to develop without U 4 s in the region of the type locality, resulting in a reduced dentition. Cryptotis mexicana: Cryptotis phillipsii has shorter, narrower foreclaws and a relatively longer tail; less modified humerus; broader palate ; simple M 3 , lacking metacone; entoconid of M 3 usually vestigial when present. Cryptotis nelsoni: Cryptotis phillipsii has shorter, narrower foreclaws and a relatively longer tail; narrower palate ; simple M 3 , lacking metacone; entoconid of M 3 usually vestigial when present. Cryptotis obscura: Cryptotis phillipsii has a relatively longer tail; upper unicuspids concave on posterior surface, appearing curved, rather than convex and coneshaped; more likely to have two well-developed dorsal foramina ; simple M 3 , lacking metacone; entoconid of M 3 usually vestigial when present. Cryptotis goldmani-group: Cryptotis phillipsii is smaller in head-and-bodylength, and has much shorter, narrower foreclaws, a much less derived humerus, and a relatively longer tail; higher coronoid process ; shorter posterior portion of mandible ; much more likely to possess vestigial entoconid of M 3 . Remarks.•The type series of Cryptotis phillipsii was collected in 1964 by William J. Schaldach, Jr. and Allan R. Phillips during a trip to southern Oaxaca to obtain specimens of birds and mammals. Schaldach originally described a new species, Notiosorex phillipsii, on the basis of three specimens: a skin with skull and a skin without skull from Rio Molino and a skin with skull from Rio Guajalote . Originally identified as Cryptotis mexicana, the main consideration in sub-sequently referring these three specimens to Notiosorex appears to have been the presence of only three unicuspids in the upper toothrow, rather than the four unicuspids typical of Cryptotis. A fourth specimen , collected at Rio Molino and possessing four unicuspids, was reported as Cryptotis mexicana . Noting strong differences in external, cranial, and dental characters between the type series of N. phillipsii and specimens of Notiosorex crawfordi and Megasorex gigas that he used for comparison, Schaldach erected a new subgenus, Xenosorex, to distinguish the new shrew. Choate reexamined the type series of Notiosorex phillipsii and reported a number of distinctive cranial, mandibular, and dental characters that clearly established N. phillipsii as a member of the genus Cryptotis, despite its reduced dentition. He justifiably placed Schaldach's N. phillipsii as a junior synonym of Cryptotis [mexicana] peregrina, where it has remained until now reported the humid, shaded ravines along the slopes of the valley of the Rio Molino at the type locality contained remnant, pine-and oak-dominated cloud forest, with a dense understory of ferns, mosses, vines, and shrubs .

{"text": "Setzer's alertness to governmental funding sources and to the appeal of this research theme was acquired early in his research career. Much of his specimen collection related to the study of Dipodomys ordii was supported by the Office of Research and Inventions, U.S. Navy , in an effort to determine the geographic ranges of suspected hosts of tularemia . A contemporaneous and direct geographic connection to Setzer's articulated goals may be found in the publications of his colleague Hoogstraal, especially that on \"Faunal Exploration as a Basic Approach for Studying Infections Common to Man and Animals,\" which Setzer occasionally cited. Hoogstraal drew attention to the uniformly poor understanding of vertebrate hosts and their parasites in Africa and underscored their inadequate taxonomy as the primary need to be redressed. Nation-states, understandably, must be concerned with supplying any martial advantage to their own armed forces, and Setzer's faunal objectives found a willing and receptive audience, one with very deep pockets, in those army and navy biomedical units charged with preventing contagious diseases. National priorities inevitably shift and budgets with them, and it is doubtful that such lavish governmental support for fundamental biological inventory, over so sweeping a geographic scale, will ever exist again. The Mammals of Africa: An Identification Manual Setzer, 1971-1977) will remain a foremost achievement of Setzer's African research, if second only to the AMP collections themselves. Its undertaking was organized and coedited with his friend and colleague Jurgens A. J. Meester, founder and initial director of the Mammal Research Institute, University of Pretoria. Conceived as a feature contribution to the nascent International Biological Program, the publication was partially funded by the U.S. and South African national committees of that organization and, significantly, enjoyed the earnest backing of S. Dillon Ripley, then Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution . Certainly, the utility and currency of the Identification Manual are now diminished, especially for the identification and taxonomy of the shrews, bats, and rodents whose convoluted alpha systematics have been dramatically overhauled by the multifaceted research of the past decade. The fruitful collaboration of Meester and Setzer, however, must be understood in the context of its era and original twofold purpose. At the time, the only pan-African treatment of mammals was Glover M. Allen's classic \"A Checkhst of African Mammals,\" which, as Setzer repeatedly emphasized in his AMP funding requests, was based on a literature compilation, not critical review of specimens. Of their two purposes, the first was simply \"to serve as an identification manual, for use by non-taxonomists,\" in particular the growing user communities of African ecologists and conservationists. Beyond this, the coeditors never pretended that the Identification Manual would dispel the confused state of African mammal taxonomy, notwithstanding the AMP, and achieve a definitive synthesis of valid species, synonyms, and geographic ranges. And so their second purpose-\"to identify the remaining problems most urgently in need of solution\"-encapsulates the enduring value of the Identification Manual, and those problems to be resolved are copiously mentioned by the various experts who composed the taxonomic chapters . In this regard, Meester and Setzer's publication succeeded famously, far surpassing Allen's checklist as a window to poorly understood groups and a catalyst to future taxonomic investigation. Few systematic papers that deal with African mammals can omit citation of Meester and Setzer as a milepost of taxonomic understanding, and few researchers could hope to bequeath a greater scientific legacy. One is still led to wonder whether Setzer had envisioned a more definitive \"Mammals of Africa,\" modeled after Mammals of North America, the landmark faunal synthesis by his former thesis advisor E. Raymond Hall , to follow the Identification Manual. Although the AMP quietly dissolved in 1972, Setzer's early funding proposals had identified future fieldwork by multiple teams through 1975, and he clearly intended to survey many other countries , including the return to Ethiopia, whose planned inventory was aborted in 1962. Hall, of course, had a much sounder framework of taxonomic and distributional understanding to build upon in composing his seminal Mammals of North America. \"Mammals of\" faunal studies existed for numerous states by the middle 1950s, and more importantly, taxonomic revisions of most North American genera and families had been completed, many accomplished by Biological Survey staff and reported in the august series North American Fauna. Eaunal treatments of African countries are much improved, many of them benefiting from AMP material and vouchered distributional records . However, the gritty, collections-based revisionary studies of problematic African groups required to resurrect valid species from names long buried in synonymy remained undone within the lifetimes of Setzer and Meester. Another generation of African researchers would be required to achieve this level of understanding, even now ongoing. In retrospect, the modest accomplishments that Meester and Setzer intended for their Identification Manual were the appropriate and achievable aims at the time. Aside from the AMP and the Identification Manual, Setzer can legitimately claim his own niche in the progress of taxonomic understanding of African Mammalia. As exemplified by Rodentia , the species-rich order that attracted most of his taxonomic attention, he described 35 species-group taxa, most from the northeastern region of the continent where he undertook his early research and fieldwork . Knowledge of the diversity of African rodents initially grew slowly in the post-Linnaean discovery phase , and an eruptive phase of natural history exploration and taxonomic description commenced in the late 1800s , during which the subspecies emerged as a standard rank to nomenclaturally identify intraspecific variation. By the conclusion of this era, over 600 species of African rodents were recognized . During the middle 1900s , a decrease driven by widespread acceptance of the biological species concept and its taxonomic application as intergrading geographic races . New subspecies continued to be named at a high rate, and many species described during the preceding eruptive phase were cursorily demoted to subspecies. Setzer's descriptions of new African forms occurred within this last period , and the majority of Verheyen Setzer 35Roberts 190Allen 21Osgood 39Thomas 387Lichtenstein 11Linnaeus Valid Species 1750 1800 1850 1900 1950 2000 Year FIGURE 2.

In his generic and species revisions, he also was predisposed to interpret population-level variation at the subspecific rank . The prevailing acceptance of the biological species over the middle 1900s, widespread employment of polytypic species to convey geographic variation under the concept. and Setzer's early training under Durrant and Hall tellingly molded his taxonomic approach at the species level. In the modern era , a foremost systematic mammalogist, Walter N. Verheyen, named 13 of his 18 new rodent discoveries as species. The revived appreciation of greater species richness in African Rodentia signaled a paradigmatic transition between the times of Setzer and Verheyen , a change impelled not only by new field discoveries and reinvigorated museum-based revision but especially by improved methodologies for evaluating and taxonomically interpreting intra-and interpopulation differences. It is noteworthy that the fresh appreciation of small-mammal diversity, as exemplified by the investigations of Verheyen and his students, has been informed in no small way by the AMP collections . The scientific value of any museum collection accrues with its repeated use and the citation of its vouchers under a paper's \"Specimens Examined.", "meta": {"ref_id": "TheSmithsonianInstitutionAfricanMammalProject(1961"}}

Rosevear precisely outlined High Forest and Guinea, Sudan, and Sahel savannas and criteria for their recognition, and many collectors mentioned his book in their field notes. Although the tallies in Table 8 suffice to convey the relative intensity of AMP survey among major biotic zones, we acknowledge some arbitrariness in classifying any individual site for reasons of geographic intermediacy, indefinite ecological characterization, or lack of habitat information altogether. In such cases, we accepted geographic location as the deciding factor in categorizing the locality. Such ambiguity sometimes confronted the AMP collectors in the field, as underscored by the complaint of H. J. Herbert in Nigeria : \"the area is High Forest. . . yet the area where all my collecting has been done is in open fields and farmed pasture lands.\" ", "meta": {"ref_id": "TheSmithsonianInstitutionAfricanMammalProject(1961"}}
{"text": "The literature on methods of biological inventory and comparative studies of collecting hardware are vastly richer than that available at the inception of the AMP in the early 1960s. Having characterized the collecting tools and field procedures employed by AMP collectors, it is instructive to consider their taxonomic results in light of certain inventory methodologies now recommended as standard for conducting a geographic inventory and assessing diversity of mammals . African Mammal Project traplines predominantly consisted of snap traps placed on the ground, whereas placement of arboreal traps was, overall, sporadic and opportunistic. mostly confined to reachable heights of 1.5-2.5 m where attempted. Prolonged, systematic efforts to trap arboreal small mammals at greater heights, such as canopy platform stations erected at 10-12 m , are not apparent. Canopy traps could have been effectively employed at the relatively few high-forest localities in western Africa but would have been an impractical method for the desert biotopes and low-canopied woodlands and savannas that form the majority of AMP localities. Although greater emphasis on trapping in trees may have improved sample sizes of certain scansorial or arboreal Rodentia and lorisiform Primates , we doubt that it would have expanded the taxonomic diversity of these groups as obtained by trapping, hunting, and purchasing. Mist nets were erected to catch foraging bats, but only one or two nets were typically deployed, and their use in flight paths was clearly secondary to the capture of resting bats at their diurnal roosts. Techniques such as sustained maintenance of many mist nets in staggered patterns and using rigging systems to elevate nets into canopy spaces are not in evidence, and the era of the AMP predates the harp trap as a popular bat-collecting device . Here again, adopting these devices and techniques may have substantially increased specimen numbers but would less likely have increased their familial and generic diversity. African Mammal Project collectors aggressively sought roosting sites, and their extensive collections of resting bats would seem to compensate for the lower effort devoted to mist-netting. The 1,225 specimens of Soricomorpha, obtained mainly by snap trap or purchase, represent approximately 2% of AMP collections , a proportion that seems incommensurate with the richness and ecological ubiquity of the order in Africa . The AMP ended about 15-20 years before the conventional use of pitfalls to collect small mammals, although the method has a much longer history of sporadic use . Trapping arrays of pitfalls linked by drift fences are highly effective for capture of small terrestrial mammals and are demonstrably superior for procuring a wide variety of shrews over small rodents , including African soricomorphs . In this instance, using pitfall traps would have certainly enhanced the numbers and diversity of Soricomorpha. Of course, the foregoing observations have the great advantage of hindsight, and our judgments must forever contain some element of conjecture. Faunal results of the AMP invite comparison with previous African surveys conducted by Smithsonian personnel in the early 1900s. Setzer deUberately, and reasonably, developed his funding proposals to cover continental regions other than the eastern sector of Africa, whose mammalian fauna he explicitly considered well known as a result of those earlier surveys. The two largest and historically most important were the Smithsonian African Expedition , and HoUister and a self-described hunternaturalist . The expedition included three experienced field scientists: Edmund Heller, who mainly assisted Teddy and son Kermit with the preservation of larger mammals; Edgar A. Mearns, who emphasized bird collecting but also obtained a wide variety of mammals; and J. Alden Loring, who focused on collection and preparation of small mammals. Independently wealthy, devoted to reckless adventure, and occasionally a philanthropist, Paul J. Rainey was a fervent big-game hunter who assumed all expenses for the second African expedition that bore his name. Eortunately, those expenses covered the services of Edmund Heller, who participated as the enterprise's sole naturalist and scientific collector of mammals. The itineraries of the two surveys overlapped in colonial British East Africa, but collecting efforts were concentrated in the territory equivalent to modern day Kenya, with marginal stops in Uganda, northeastern Tanzania, and southern Sudan. The significantly longer duration of the AMP naturally accounts for a much larger collection of mammals in total , but conspicuous proportional differences are apparent among the various orders . In concert with the overriding hunting pursuits of their principal benefactors, the African surveys of Roosevelt and Rainey obtained higher numbers for those orders that include big game , these amounting to nearly 20% of all mammals collected compared to about 2% for the AMP. The lack of mist nets must explain, in large measure, the lower numbers of bats, absolutely and relatively, in the collections made in the early 1900s, but we are surprised by and cannot readily account for the comparatively higher success in procuring soricomorph shrews by those earlier collectors. As in the AMP, rodents are also predominant among the early eastern African col- \"HoUister reported a total of 7841 USNM specimens for these two expeditions. Some were subsequently traded to other institutions , but their absence does not materially alter the percentages of the orders. lections, given their great diversity in species, abundant populations in all manner of habitats, and deployment of snap-trap lines by Heller, Loring, and Mearns. Other differences among orders are slight and unremarkable or reflect continental patterns of endemism or a lack of deliberate collecting effort .

Setzer's early visit to Chad was only an exploratory survey to identify possible areas for future work ; L. W. Robbins' fieldwork in Algeria and Niger was designed as a transect across the Sahara, not as broadscale inventory of those countries; LeDuc's and C. B. Robbins' efforts in Togo were curtailed by bureaucratic hurdles; and activities in The Gambia and Lesotho were little more than side excursions by AMP teams working in their larger neighbors . Collecting effort in each of the 14 remaining countries totaled at least 80 days of survey and may be expected to provide better documentation of their small mammals. A strong association logically exists between the total collecting effort and the number of specimens obtained per country . Teams active in Ghana and Morocco realized extremely productive results for the total number of days spent collecting, as indicated by the large, positive residuals relative to the regression line. Collecting activities at a cardinal locality ranged anywhere from 1 to 16 days . Slightly more than 25% of the localities were visited on a single day , and nearly all of these involved opportunistic acquisitions, such as side trips to bat haunts, pickups of roadkills, and purchasing or shooting specimens while traveHng between localities. In three countries, the length of survey effort was necessarily constrained to mostly one-day stops: G. L. Ranck in Libya logistically relied upon army convoys for much of his fieldwork, especially into the interior; collecting by L. W. Robbins in Algeria and Niger was essentially a one-way, by-road transect across the middle Sahara, accomplished in about 10 weeks. Most two-day stays appear to represent localities where collectors abruptly terminated their inventory because of unpromising initial trapping results. Approximately 60% of the localities encompass 3-8 days of faunal inventory , and only a few were longer . We regard the 3-16 day range of collecting periods to represent dedicated site inventory, that is, localities where AMP field teams employed a variety of survey methods and equipment, applied them in a sustained manner, and obtained a representative mixture -\" ", "meta": {"ref_id": "TheSmithsonianInstitutionAfricanMammalProject(1961"}}

Mammal inventory in western Africa was surprisingly broad and immensely successful owing to the intense efforts of 15 major collectors over the relatively short span of four years . Eor whatever reason, field workers in western Africa devoted greater emphasis to collection of bats, and the abundance of Chiroptera mainly accounts for differences in specimen totals among regions . Rosevear's Bats of West Africa is specifically mentioned by several collectors in their field journals, particularly in the context of describing habitats and designating biomes for their collecting area . As a result, a majority of cardinal localities in western Africa are characterized using Rosevear's terminology of High Eorest and Guinea, Sudan, and Sahel savannas for the more or less distinctive vegetation belts that stretch across the region. Another contemporaneous book carried in the field and valued for its field-guide format was Booth's We combined coverage of Senegal and The Gambia because the principal field team, composed of Richard M. Davis and Dean E. Fiarvey, traveled between the two countries in making their single itinerary. More time and effort were understandably devoted to survey in geographically larger Senegal ; only three localities are recorded for The Gambia. Although Harvey did set traplines and collected mammals during the Oct 1965 to Jul 1966 trip, Davis maintained the field catalog, and only his name is Hsted as collector on mammal specimens taken during that time. In his field journal, Harvey emphasized the \"picking\" of ectoparasites among his other activities as well as general collecting of insects and herps.

Evolutionary change occurs via interacting forces of mutation, migration, drift, and selection. The neutral theory, as described by Kimura . Evidence supporting the neutral theory includes many observations of faster rates o f silent than of replacement substitutions and faster evolution at the third positions of codons . The neutral theory does not predict the frequent action o f positive, Darwinian, selection; however, positive selection has also been hypothesized to act on molecular sequences. Indeed, evidence for the action of positive Darwinian selection has been found in particular categories o f genes, including genes expressed on the surfaces of parasites and viruses , genes involved in defensive systems or immunity, reproduction, digestion, toxin production, electron transport, and cytokine production . The relative importance o f genetic drift and natural selection are different depending on the situation. One approach to studying the relative importance o f these forces is to experimentally manipulate the rate of recombination, population size, or selective forces acting on organisms in the laboratory . An example of this approach is the experimental formation of very large neo-Y and neo-X chromosomes in Drosophila melanogaster, which, after 35 generations, showed that nonrecombining chromosomes can degenerate rapidly . Alternatively, we may retrospectively examine genetic material evolving naturally with characteristics that are more or less subject to either genetic drift or natural selection. In particular, genetic linkage and small population sizes are expected to cause natural selection to work inefficiently. Clonally inherited genetic material, which is completely genetically linked, is found in the genomes o f asexually reproducing organisms. Completely linked genetic material is also found in the non recombining portions of the genomes of sexually reproducing organisms. The degree of linkage also varies even within the recombining portions of the genome . Small effective populations can be found in organisms that have experienced a recent population bottleneck or a founder effect, as well as in chromosomes such as the Y that are present in fewer copies than others. In small populations random sampling error becomes relatively more important than purifying selection against deleterious alleles or positive selection for beneficial alleles. Drift may lead to decreased polymorphism . Positive selection for one allele o f a gene can cause the fixation of other closely linked alleles in a process called \"hitchhiking\" . These linked alleles may be mildly deleterious ) and would not be expected to go to fixation when purifying selection acts efficiently. At an extreme, one haplotype can be \"swept\" to fixation in an entire population. This effect, known as a selective sweep, has been hypothesized to explain the reduced polymorphism in regions with low recombination in the Drosophila genome . New, beneficial variants on linked chromosomes may be removed from a population because they are 'trapped' in a genetic background with deleterious mutations . Another potential effect of linkage is caused by Muller's ratchet . A completely linked chromosome in a finite population will accumulate chance mutations over time, which cannot be removed by recombination. Thus the least mutated chromosome cannot be restored once it has been mutated. This effect is referred to as a ratchet because it cannot run backwards . Also, background selection against deleterious mutations, which are subject to strong negative selection, can reduce the effective population size of other neutral or weakly selected linked alleles, thereby causing Muller's ratchet to accelerate . On the other hand, recombination itself may be mutagenic. The pseudoautosomal region has a high recombination rate since for every meiosis there is an obligate crossover in this small region. Fxy, a gene that crosses the pseudoautosomal boundary in Mus musculus, but not in other related species, has an increased synonymous substitution rate within its pseudoautosomal portion in M. musculus. . In addition to their effects at the population level, linkage and genetic drifr have been proposed to act together in the Hill-Robertson effect interfere with selection at the species level . The action of selection on one locus reduces the effective population size of other linked loci since some haplotypes will be passed on to future generations in larger numbers than others. This decrease in the effective population size increases the susceptibility o f the linked loci to random genetic drift This effect can be seen between species as an increase in the rate of fixation o f slightly deleterious mutations to synonymous substitutions as the nuclear genes . Using the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions corrects for any differences in the synonymous substitution rates between the organelle genes and the nuclear genes. The relatively high number of nonsynonymous substitutions in organelle genes may indicate that natural selection cannot remove these mutations from nonrecombining organelle genes as efficiently as it removes them from recombining nuclear genes. When natural selection is not efficient, due to a predominance of drift, deleterious mutations that cause a loss of fitness may accumulate. Deleterious mutations have been shown to accumulate in non-recombining genomes in laboratory populations of RNA viruses and in bacteria . A synthetic Y chromosome in Drosophila melanogaster, which lacked recombination, experienced a significant decay in fitness after 35 generations . A decay in fitness of Y chromosomes can also be inferred from natural populations o f Drosophila. A novel chromosome formed less than 5 million years ago by the fusion o f the Y with an autosome in Drosophila miranda has lost expression of several Y chromosomal genes . In Drosophila americana americana, a newly arisen neo-Y chromosome has lost sequence diversity relative to the neo-X chromosome, an expected first stage of Y chromosome degeneration . The Y-linked Dhc-Yh3 gene in Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans has a low level of polymorphism within populations . This was attributed to a selective sweep, or alternatively to a large variance in male fertility, which causes a low effective population size and the effects related to it . In a dioecious plant, Silene latifolia, the Y-linked gene, SLY-1 has a lower level of polymorphism than its X-linked ancestral homologue SLX-1, attributed to background selection or Muller's ratchet . The mammalian Y chromosome has a small effective population size and is completely linked. It is transmitted as a single, indivisible unit from one generation to the next. The combined results from the Y chromosomes of other taxa and from other non-recombining chromosomes predict that genes on the mammalian Y chromosome will also have high ratios o f nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions across species and low levels o f polymorphism within species. There are differences between these other systems and the mammalian Y chromosome that may cause them to evolve differently. For instance, the natural population sizes of insects are larger than those of mammals. Muller's ratchet might not affect large Drosophila populations, but may be a factor in the evolution of small mammalian population . Y-linked genes would also be expected to be affected by mating systems, which likely differ between mammals and insects: if only a few males contribute gametes to the next generation, the effective population size o f Y-linked genes will be reduced relative to X-linked, autosomal, and mitochondrial genes . Also, the Y chromosome in mammals has fewer genes to serve as targets for mutation than the Y chromosome in Silene or the synthetic Drosophilid Y chromosome . When three Y chromosomal loci were compared with X linked and autosomal loci in humans and in mice, the variability in the Y loci was not consistently lower, as would have been expected as a result of hitchhiking or background selection . One explanation for this surprising result is that the low gene density on the Y led to few targets being available for selection . The mammalian Y chromosome is the topic of the remainder o f this chapter, with a focus on Y-linked genes compared across species. A brief introduction to the formation of the sex chromosomes is followed by an explanation of some methods used in the study of Y-linked genes, and a review of recent discoveries, reported in the literature and in subsequent chapters o f this dissertation, about the pattern of evolution of some of these genes in mice. Sex determination can be environmental, genic, or chromosomal. Chromosomal sex determination may have evolved from genic sex determination by the gradual accumulation of sex-specific genes in the region of the sex-determining gene, where they would be more likely to be inherited by offspring of the correct sex . Although these male-benefit alleles are hypothesized to accumulate near the male sex determining locus, occasional recombination would cause them to be inherited by females. This would increase the genetic load in females, causing selection for a reduction in recombination in this region, or for sex-linked expression. Suppression of recombination may be the less complex mechanism, and hence is more likely to evolve. This may then start a \"chain reaction\" in which more sexually antagonistic genes accumulate near the non-recombining region, causing selection for a larger non recombining region . This \"functional coherence\" has been found in the human Y chromosome which has collected genes involved in male fitness ). This appears to be a general phenomenon since similar functional coherence has been reported in mice and even on the Y chromosome of a plant, Silene latifolia . In mammals, the sex-determining gene is on the Y chromosome. It is thought that the mammalian sex chromosomes originally evolved from an autosomal chromosome pair ). It appears that the mammalian Y and X chromosomes evolved through a series of additions of DNA to both chromosomes, loss of recombination, and eventual degeneration of the non-recombining Y genes through several possible mechanisms and plant sex-determining chromosomes as further examples. Distinguishable, homologous, X and Y chromosomes are found in all mammalian groups including eutherians, monotremes, and marsupials . Similar, but independently evolved, Z and W chromosomes are found in birds, in which females are the heterogametic sex. The avian sex chromosomes appear to have also evolved from a homologous pair of chromosomes . Some dioecious plants also have chromosomally based sex determination. In these atypical plants, as in mammals, the male is the heterogametic sex. Silene latifolia is a well-studied species with sex chromosomes that appeared between 8 and 24 million years ago Properties of Sex chromosomes These independently evolved sex chromosomes share characteristics such as genetic linkage and small effective population sizes that may cause their genes to evolve with different rates and patterns from genes on other chromosomes. Inheritance only through males may cause an increase in the neutral mutation rate of mammalian Y chromosomal gene because the increased number of germ cell line divisions in male gametogenesis allows more chances for a mistake in copying the DNA . Evidence for a higher mutation rate in male-specific genes has been found in mammals and plants, although in Silene, the difference is too great to be solely due to the number o f DNA replications during pollen production . Because this effect, known as \"male-driven evolution\", acts on the neutral mutation rate, it is not expected to interfere with natural selection. Some differences between the Y chromosome and autosomes are expected to interfere with either purifying or positive natural selection. The Y chromosome is present in just one copy and only in males. In those diploid mating systems in which equal numbers o f males and females mate, there are four copies o f each autosome for every one Y chromosome. The relatively small effective population size o f the Y chromosome is further reduced in populations with polygynous mating systems where only a few of the pool of Y chromosomes are passed on to the next generation . Another difference from other chromosomes is that most of the Y is completely genetically linked except a for small pseudo autosomal region. At the population level, linkage's interference with natural selection is also expected to decrease polymorphism because it reduces the number of distinct Y chromosomes in a population. In completely linked genetic regions, such as the Y chromosome, selection acts on the whole chromosome at once so a beneficial mutation can cause a single Y chromosome to \"sweep\" to fixation in a population. The Hill Robertson Effect is likely to affect the molecular evolution of the Y chromosome. The effects o f linkage on the Y chromosome may be similar to linkage's effects on other clonally inherited genetic material. Most Y chromosomal genes have a counterpart on the X chromosome --a gametolog , but in some mammals, such as humans several genes are found only on the Y . Also, Y chromosomal genes often diverge significantly from their X chromosomal counterparts, thereby becoming haploid in their gene dosage. These genes are more exposed to natural selection since deleterious alleles on a haploid chromosome cannot be hidden from selection like recessive diploid alleles . This would enhance selection and so act in the opposite direction to other forces acting on the Y chromosome. On the other hand, Y chromosomal genes that do share a function with a gametolog would act like heterozygotes, so selection against deleterious mutations would be reduced . There is evidence that some o f these genes may not act as complete recessives, so there may indeed be selection against them . To determine if natural selection works inefficiently on the Y chromosome using data from cross-species comparisons, the interfere with purifying selection, dN/dS should be less than 1 for Y-linked genes, but greater than the baseline dN/dS ratio predicted for purifying selection. This baseline purifying selection ratio might be determined by an overall survey o f autosomal genes, on the assumption that purifying selection is the dominant force in molecular evolution. These averages have been calculated as 0.07 to 0.14 for rodents. In a comparison of 12,615 mouse-human orthologs, the median dN/dS was 0.115, and 13,391 predicted protein domains had a median dN/dS of 0.062 . Another possibility is to compare a Ylinked gene to an autosomal or X-linked gene that is thought to be exposed to purifying selection. In this chapter, I review comparisons of Zfy to Zfx and Smcy to Smcx. or calculate numbers o f substitution based on ancestral reconstructions . Using a phylogenetic context is preferable to making pairwise comparisons because in pairwise comparisons a single internal branch may be inadvertently sampled several times . The maximum likelihood methods and log likelihood ratio comparisons using Chi square tests that were used for the Zfy and Sry studies are not appropriate for the comparison of Smcy and Smcx. The ancestral reconstruction method was used for comparisons of Smcy and Smcx because it is more appropriate for these very similar sequences. This method involved reconstructing sequences at ancestral nodes of Smcx and Smcy gene trees and counting the numbers of nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions on each branch. The significance o f the differences between nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions in the two genes was computed using Fisher's Exact Test. In this review, the results o f the counting method will be indicated by lower case n and s. One potential difficulty with these methods is deciding if an elevated dN/dS or n/s represents: evidence for inefficient purifying selection on a functional gene, a partial release from selection because the gene is not important, or positive selection on only part o f the gene. There is no solution to this problem. Looking at gene function may help, since a gene with a new function in one species is more likely undergoing positive selection than a gene that retains a single function in all species. Another approach is to use a model that can assign particular characters within a coding segment to a category of characters experiencing positive selection . Three Y chromosomal genes have been studied in a phylogenetic context in the same mouse genus, Mus . One advantage o f using the same taxa in these comparisons is that taxonomic history is not responsible for any differences in the results. For Zfy and Smcy, comparisons with their X chromosomal gametologs in the same taxa are also available . A brief review of the structures, functions, and evolution of these genes follows. The structure of Sry is slightly different among mammalian taxa. It always contains an HMG box, which is highly conserved in eutherians and marsupials, as well as various nonconserved flanking sequences . Sry is the sex determining gene in mammals . XX mice transgenic for mouse Sry develop as males, not females, although sex reversal does not occur in mice in response to human SRY . The Sry protein is a transcription factor that binds to and bends DNA . The ability to bind and bend DNA is located in the High Mobility Group box. When primate SRY proteins are expressed in Escherichia coli, the HMG-boxes have similar affinities for SRY's binding site and bent the bound DNA to a similar angle . Mutations causing sex reversals in humans are associated with a change in the DNA binding or bending properties o f the HMG box, while mutations that do not cause sex reversal maintain these properties . Sry is most closely related to Sox3 , a gene found on the X chromosome in eutherian and marsupial lineages . Sox3, like Sry, consists of a single exon with a DNA-binding domain. Maximum likelihood and parsimony analyses o f Sox family members and Sry show that Sry is most closely related to Sox3 . Evidence for a higher than average dN/dS has been found in Sry in rodents and primates . Full length Sry appears to evolve more slowly in the family Bovidae , although it evolves with a higher dN/dS within the conserved HMG box than rodent and primate Sry . In pairwise comparisons of rodent Sry sequences, the dN/dS value ranges from 0.33 to 0.45 and in primates from 0.47 to 1.88 . While the results of most of these pairwise comparisons are less than one, they are higher than the average dN/dS ratios in mouse and rat, which is 0.07 to 0.14 . The dN/dS values for Sry are also high in comparison to Sox3 . In human-mouse comparisons of Sox3, the fast-evolving terminal parts have a combined dN/dS value of 0.088, and no nonsynonymous substitutions are detected in the HMG box region . Sry was reanalysed in mice , using a maximum likelihood method that takes the phylogenetic structure into account . Models that allow different dN/dS levels in different lineages do not fit the data significantly better than a model that requires the same ratio over the entire Mus tree . However, maximum likelihood models that allow positive selection on particular sites in Sry fit the data significantly better than models that do not allow positive selection. When all characters are forced to share a ratio, dN/dS = 0.478, a value that is similar to ratios obtained using pairwise distance comparisons of many of the same species . Zfy, Zfy-1, and Zfy-2 have a highly acidic amino terminal domain and a carboxylterminal domain of 13 Cys-Cys-His-His zinc fingers Mardon et al. 1990 ). The zinc finger domains are similar between Zfx and Zfy proteins, while the amino-terminal portions are not . Zfa is a processed transcript lacking an intron of Zfy that was retrotransposed during rodent evolution . The ZF genes are thought to act as transcription factors . When maximum likelihood models are applied to Zfy, Zfy, and Zfa in mice, models that allow a separate dN/dS for each gene fit the data significantly better than models that force the same dN/dS for all genes. In these analyses, Zfy has a dN/dS = 0.04, Zfy has a dN/dS = 0.38, and Zfa has a dN/dS = 0.27 . Mouse Zfy proteins appear to have diverged rapidly from human ZFY, while mouse Zfx, human ZFX and human ZFY are relatively conserved . Human ZFY and ZFX proteins are 97% identical to mouse Zfx, but mouse Zfy proteins are only 80% identical to the others . Zfy and Zfy appear to have experienced gene conversion in human , crab-eating fox , and in Felidae . Pamilo and Bianchi also report gene conversion in mouse, based on a short sequence of the last exon . More recent studies using several species of Mus and a longer portion o f Zfx and Zfy do not show evidence for gene conversion in mouse . Perhaps gene conversion in primates is the cause of the relatively slow evolution of the ZF genes in human compared with mouse. In mice, Smcy and Smcx share the same genomic structure o f 26 exons . Smcy encodes several of the H-Y antigens that can cause the rejection of male-donor tissue transplants in female recipients . Both Smcy and Smcx are members of the jumonji family of transcription factors . They share domains that are typical of this family: jumonji N-terminal and C-terminal domains , a dead ringer domain , a PHD finger , and an atypical PHD finger. The jumonji Cterminal domain appears to be a member o f the cupin superfamily due to sequence similarity, secondary structure similarity, and conservation of presumed active-site residues . This indicates that JmjC domains are likely to be metalloenzymes that interact with zinc, and are potentially involved in NAD+ generation . The presence o f two PHD fingers in the Smcy and Smcx genes suggests that they are involved in chromatin-mediated transcriptional regulation . Smcy is detectable in marsupials, indicating that Smcx and Smcy diverged at least 120 million years ago . Ancestral sequences o f Smcy and Smcx were reconstructed on a robust nuclear gene tree of the genus Mus. A counting method that is appropriate for the small sample sizes of the substitutions in Smcy and Smcx was used . The numbers o f nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions were counted along each branch of the nuclear gene tree. Significantly more nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions occurred in Smcy than in Smcx. Using the ACCTRAN method to construct ancestral sequences, Smcy had 22 nonsynonymous and 17 synonymous substitutions, while Smcx had 5 nonsynonymous and 14 synonymous substitutions. Maximum likelihood models similar to those used to study Zjx and Zfy were not significantly better when a separate dN/dS value was used for each gene . Smcx/y, Zjx/y, and Sry/Sox3 have a higher dN/dS or a higher n/s in the Y chromosomal gene. The fact that all o f these genes show the same general pattern argues that the pattern is caused by their sex chromosomal inheritance. To determine if this might be affected by other gene-specific factors, some of these factors are compared below. There are several categories in which the three Y chromosomal genes and their X chromosomal counterparts can be compared . Some of these categories interrelate: X inactivation status and expression pattern may indicate something about functional differences in genes. Some categories have implications for the explanation of differences between X and Y chromosomal dN/dS, for example, differing expression patterns are known to influence dN . Others, such as the X chromosomal strata of gametologs, may not be directly related to a Y chromosomal effect on dN/dS. There are two types of Y chromosomal genes: recombining pseudoautosomal genes and non-recombining genes. Genes in the pseudoautosomal regions of the sex chromosomes act like genes on paired autosomes. It appears that there is a gradient of recombination along the pseudoautosomal region . Different genes are found pseudoautosomally in different lineages, for instance IL3RA is pseudoautosomal in human but autosomal in mice . It is likely that pseudoautosomal regions are recent additions to the sex chromosomes, which will eventually undergo the same process o f Y chromosomal degradation as previous additions and are widely expressed in mammalian tissues. They also appear to exist in only one copy on the Y chromosome. The X chromosomal gametologs o f these genes escape X-inactivation, the process by which gene dosage is equalized in mammals. Because o f their expression patterns and the known functions of several of these gene pairs, this class of genes is expected to be involved in essential housekeeping functions . In human these genes include RPS4Y, ZFY, USP9Y, DBY, UTY, TB4Y, SMCY, and EIF1AY. Only three examples o f Y chromosomal genes with X chromosomal gametologs that escape inactivation are known in mice, Smcy , Uty , and eIF-2gamma ). Class 2 includes the genes that exist only on the Y chromosome, have no X-linked gametolog, and are expressed only in the testes. They are often found in multiple copies on the Y chromosome. These genes probably encode male-specific functions . In human, these genes include TTY1, TSPY, PRY, TTY2, CDY, XKRY, DAZ, and BPY2 . This class is not found in mice, for example, human TSPY is a class 2 gene, but in mice it is a pseudogene . Class 3 includes Y-linked genes with tissue-restricted expression that retain X chromosomal gametologs: SRY, RBMY, AMELY, VCY, and PCD H Yin human . In mouse, Zfy, Ubely, Usp9y , Sry, and Rbmy may be categorized this way. Class 3 genes are probably evolving either toward class 2 or toward loss-of-function as pseudogenes . In some species of mice Sry has been duplicated on the Y chromosome, a step towards class 2 Lundrigan and Tucker 1997 ). Here we review genes from the first and third class in the genus Mus. Because each o f the Y chromosomal genes had elevated dN/dS or a higher n/s than its X chromosomal gametolog, this effect is not dependent on the class to which the genes belong. Lahn and Page discovered human X chromosomal strata by measuring the synonymous distance between X and Y gametologs. They found that the distances fell into four distinct groups that corresponded to the order o f the genes along the human X chromosome. The first o f these four \"strata\" was formed before the divergence of monotremes ), the second between the divergence o f monotremes and marsupials , and the third before the divergence of simians . The fourth stratum was formed after the divergence of simian and prosimian lineages . The fourth stratum appears to have diverged at different times in different mammalian orders . The plant genus Silene has two X-Y gene pairs that diverged 5 and 15 million years ago, which shows that sequential inactivation of recombination has occurred for gametologs in plants as well as in mammals . Two WZ gametologs have been found in birds. One, CHDIW/Z appears to have been present in ancestral bird lineages . The other, ATP5AIZ/W, has diverged independently in several lineages , indicating that it has diverged functionally from its ancestral homolog on the X chromosome, Sox3 Katoh and Miyata 1999 Lee, Ota and Vacquier 1995) . This competition would result in an evolutionary arms race similar to that seen between hosts and parasites or diseases, systems in which several examples of positive selection have been found . Wang, Zhang, and Zhang have shown that positive selection is not acting to a greater degree on Sry in polygamous rather than monogamous primates, which was a predicted consequence o f the arms-race proposed by . Sry has been viewed as a broadly defined reproductive gene . Like some other reproductive genes, such as lysin in abalone , and the zona pellucida gene in mammals , it has been proposed that Sry may be diverging in response to selection, and thereby acting as a reproductive isolating mechanism . However Sry functions to determine sex, not recognize gametes, so it is unclear how it could act as a traditional reproductive isolating mechanism and Smcx's escape from X inactivation . O f the three Y chromosomal genes examined, Smcy is the most likely to share a function with its gametolog. It also has the least difference in n and s from its gametolog. The fact that it does have more nonsynonymous substitutions than Smcx provides further support for a Y chromosomal effect. The alternative is that Smcy is very slowly changing to a new function but remains very similar to Smcx and so has a lower n/s than many Y chromosomal genes. Data from Wyckoff et al Genes that are expressed in many tissues have a lower dN/dS than genes that are expressed in few tissues . Zjx is expressed ubiquitously , but Zjy has more limited expression. In mice Zjy is expressed in the adult testes, the germ cells, the genital ridge, and at lower levels in other tissues Nagamine et al. 1990; Zambrowicz et al. 1994) . The limited expression o f Zfy could be responsible for its relatively high dN/dS . Smcy and Smcx are each expressed in all tissues that have been examined , so the number of tissues in which Smcy is expressed is not the cause of its elevated n/s. Widely expressed genes may have more functional constraints than genes expressed only in a few tissues . This could explain the small difference between the n/s o f Smcy and Smcx compared to the larger difference between Zjy and Zfc in many of the same taxa . Sry and Sox3 both have limited expression. In mice, Sry is expressed in the male genital ridge, with some expression in the brain , while Sox3 is expressed in the brain, with some expression in the genital ridge and humans . Smcx also appears to escape X inactivation in other primates, horses, dogs, whales, and elephants . More detailed experiments show that the levels of escape from X inactivation vary by tissue type and through development, as well as from cell to cell within early development Sheardown et al. 1996; Lingenfelter et al. 1998 , Zfy and Zfy , Smcx and Smcy . 2-Sry and Sox3 , Zfy and Zfy Mardon et al. 1990; Nagamine et al. 1990; Zambrowicz et al. 1994) , Smcx and Smcy ). 3Zfy , Smcy ). Chapter 4. Calculated using PAML program ®Low levels of expression in brain 7 Low levels of expression in genital ridge %Smcy and Smcx difference in dN/dS was not statistically significant ^ *® , and background trapping . All of these mechanisms involve the action of a selective force, either positive or negative, on some genes to cause other linked genes to be insensitive to selection . These effects can cause mildly deleterious mutations to accumulate on the linked Y chromosome. In addition, the mammalian Y chromosome is inherited only through the male, has a small effective population size, and is hemizygous. The Y chromosome's low effective population size may cause random factors such as genetic drift to become relatively more important than natural selection in determining patterns of change. Linkage and genetic drift have been proposed to act together in the Hill-Robertson effect to interfere with selection at the species level reviewed and modeled by . Muller suggested that lethal mutations in Y chromosomal genes are hidden from selection by their X chromosomal counterparts ). Without purifying selection against deleterious mutations, the Y chromosome would degenerate . Alternatively, Y chromosomal genes may diverge in function from their X chromosomal gametologs thereby becoming more like haploid genes . These genes would be more exposed to natural selection so would be expected to show evidence of more efficient selection, the opposite of the effect of other Y chromosomal properties. Inheritance only through males may cause an increase in the neutral mutation rate of mammalian Y chromosomes . This effect, male-driven evolution, is not expected to alter the efficiency of natural selection and will not be addressed further in this study. We are interested in determining if genes on the Y chromosome show patterns o f evolution consistent with inefficient purifying selection, or if these genes evolve in a locus-specific manner related to their particular functions. Zfy, a similar pattern should be seen in other Y chromosomal genes, including Smcy. Over time, many Y chromosomal genes in the nonrecombining region of the Y chromosome have diverged in function or expression pattern from their gametologs on the X chromosome. If their functions become different, then differences in their dN/dS could be caused by selection. Transgenic Sry can cause sex-reversal in XX mice , indicating that it has diverged functionally from its ancestral homolog on the X chromosome, Sox3 Katoh and Miyata 1999 ). It is not known if Zfx and Zfy have different functions. Generally, genes expressed in many tissues have a lower dN/dS than genes expressed in few tissues . Zfx is expressed ubiquitously , but Zfy has more limited expression . In mice, Sry is expressed in the male genital ridge, with some expression in the brain, while Sox3 is expressed in the brain, with some expression in the genital ridge and Smcx , in species of the rodent murine genus Mus . In mice, Smcy and Smcx share the same genomic structure of 26 exons . Smcy is present in marsupials, indicating that Smcx and Smcy diverged at least 120 million years ago . Smcy encodes several o f the H-Y antigens that can cause the rejection o f male-donor tissue transplants in female recipients . Both Smcy and Smcx are members of the jumonji family of transcription factors . Smcx escapes X inactivation in mice ) and humans . Smcx also appears to escape X inactivation in other primates, horses, dogs, whales, and elephants . In gene pairs in which the X-linked gene escapes inactivation, males may be constrained to have exactly one functionally equivalent gene on the Y chromosome to maintain an equivalent gene dosage . Many of the same species used in the study o f rodent Sry were used here to make the results more comparable . The sister group to Mus is unknown, although there is evidence from DNA hybridization for a sister group relationship with the Praomys group . Members of the Praomys group were used as outgroups for rooted trees in this study. Mus mus cuius mus cuius and Mus domesticus are often represented as subspecies due to their ability to hybridize along contact zones ). These hybrids suffer from a loss o f fertility and the species are genetically and morphologically distinct away from the hybrid zones. Herein they will be discussed as distinct species, not as subspecies o f Mus . Mus musculus molossinus is the result of hybridizations o f M. musculus musculus, M. musculus castcmeus, and occasionally M. domesticus, in Japan . Genomic DNA was extracted from frozen tissues . The polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify a fragment of Smcy that includes two complete exons . Amplifications were performed using various cycling conditions determined empirically using several primer sets in different taxa. Denaturation cycles ranged from 15 seconds to 1 minute , annealing ranged from 30 seconds to 1 minute , and extension ranged from 1 to 3 minutes . These cycles were repeated 25 to 45 times. Most reactions were preceded by a 94 or 95 °C soak for 3 to 10 minutes and all were followed by a 72 *C extension for 7 or 10 minutes. Most reactions were done with AmpliTaq polymerase or a TaqMaster kit using the recommended concentrations o f ingredients. A Dynazyme EXT kit and AmpliTaq Gold were also used, as directed. PCR products were separated by size and excised from agarose gels. Samples were either purified using a QIA-Quick Gel Extraction Kit or using the \"freeze squeeze\" method followed by clean-up with Amicon Microcon centrifugal filter columns . Sequencing o f PCR products was done using dye-terminator sequencing kits . The dye-terminator reaction results were separated by size and recorded using an ABI automated sequencer. Most reactions were sequenced in-house, but some were sent to the University o f Michigan DNA Sequencing Core. All sequences were verified by sequencing both strands o f the template DNA. Sequences were proofed and edited using Sequencher version 4 . All sequences have been deposited in Genbank . Smcy and Smcx nucleotide sequences were aligned using Clustal X Smcx and Smcy intron and exon data were also combined with sequences from four other nuclear genes from Lundrigan et al. : Sry, B2m, Zp-3, and Tcp-l, in a total evidence parsimony analysis. This tree was rooted using the outgroups Mastomys and Hylomyscus. The branch and bound option in PAUP*4.0bl0 was used for maximum parsimony analyses. Characters were equally weighted and unordered. Bootstrapping was done using the full heuristic option with 1000 replicates. Silent and replacement substitutions were analyzed using a codon based likelihood approach that allows variation in the rate of substitutions in different lineages, in a phylogenetic context . These methods are implemented in the computer program PAML 3.13 . Roots were removed from rooted trees for this analysis. Two models were examined with PAML. The one-ratio model forced a single dN/dS ratio on all lineages in the tree. The chromosome-specific model allowed a separate dN/dS ratio for Smcy and Smcx lineages. The chromosome-specific model also allowed a third ratio for the branch connecting Smcy and Smcx. Likelihood ratio tests were used to determine if the chromosome-specific model fit the data significantly better than the one-ratio model. LRTs were performed by comparing the negative of twice the difference o f the log likelihoods o f the two models to a chi-square table with degrees of freedom equal to the difference in the number of parameters for each model. These methods were used to allow comparison with the many other studies that use dN/dS as a metric for types o f natural selection. Because of the small number of substitutions in the sequences studied, a method that is appropriate for small samples was also used . For this analysis, the uncorrected numbers o f replacement and silent substitutions were counted along the branches of the most parsimonious nuclear tree, with its root removed. Ancestral sequences were reconstructed using the program anc-gene . This program first determines the ancestral amino acid sequences using a distance-based bayesian method, then reconstructs the nucleotide sequence at each node. Both the Poisson model and the J IT empirical model of amino acid substitution under the extended parsimony mode o f anc-gene were used. The resulting ancestral sequences were compared using the Nei and Gojobori method implemented in MEGA 2.1 . The numbers o f replacement and silent changes were mapped along each branch on the nuclear tree topology. The numbers of replacement and silent changes were rounded to the nearest whole number and then compared using Fisher's exact test, which is appropriate for small samples, implemented in the Fisher program . Similar analyses were done with parsimony ancestral reconstructions using the ACCTRAN and DELTRAN methods o f ancestral reconstruction in PAUP* 4.0b 10 . Mean pairwise distances were determined using MEGA 2.1 with the Jukes Cantor option because this simple method is expected to work well for distances less than 0.25 . Standard error was estimated with MEGA 2.1 using the bootstrap method with 10.000 replicates. Eight unrooted equally most parsimonious trees were recovered from the branch and bound search o f 26 OTUs . A strict consensus o f these is shown in Figure 2 .1, with bootstrap support. Two distinct clades, one exclusively o f Smcy, one exclusively of Smcx, show as expected, that these two genes have evolved separately since before the origins of the species examined here. This topology also suggests that if gene conversion has occurred, it did not include the entire gene. The tree topology built using only Smcy and Smcx is unresolved in several clades. An outgroup-rooted gene tree was built using nuclear sequences from Lundrigan et al. along with Smcy and Smcx. One most parsimonious tree was recovered. The topology of this tree differs from the Smcyand Smcxspecific tree in the previous analysis in two ways. The branches that were previously unresolved are now resolved, and the relationship o f Hylomyscus and Mastomys is changed . For input to the PAML analyses, this topology with 13 OTUs representing 13 taxa, was duplicated and a branch was added connecting the roots o f the two trees to make one large tree. The tree was converted to an unrooted topology for these analyses. This new \"duplicated nuclear\" tree has 26 OTUs representing Smcy and Smcx for each taxon. For the Anc-Gene analysis, the two genes were analyzed separately, using the unduplicated nuclear gene tree as program input. Again, these trees were converted to unrooted topologies for the analysis. Both the duplicated nuclear tree topology and the Smcy/x-specific consensus topology were used in PAML analyses. Both topologies produced similar results; only the results from the duplicated nuclear tree topology are reported here. Using the chromosome-specific model, which allows different dN/dS for Smcy and Smcx, dN/dS for Smcy was 0.379 and for Smcx was 0.195. However, the chromosome-specific model did not fit the data significantly better than the one-ratio model, in which Smcy and Smcx share a ratio of 0.321 . Mean pairwise distances for coding sequences were: Smcy 0.02904 ± 0.00351 and Smcx 0.01047 ± 0.00216. The mean pairwise distance between these two sets of coding sequences was 0.31945 ± 0.02411. The relatively high rate o f replacement substitutions in the Y chromosomal genes, shown that in particular instances, Sry is not evolving because of locus-specific positive selection . If indeed Sry's and Zfy's patterns of evolution are due to a Y chromosomal effect rather than to locus-specific effects related to their functions, the pattern should also be seen for other Y chromosomal genes. To begin to address this hypothesis, a pair of genes o f which one is on the Y chromosome and one on the X chromosome , were examined. These genes were chosen for this analysis because they once were allelic, and are expected to continue to share a function . Additionally, they have similar expression patterns, which eliminates a confounding factor: differences in dN/dS associated with the number of tissues in which a gene is expressed . Maximum likelihood tests show that Smcy has a higher dN/dS than Smcx, as predicted if there are Y chromosomal effects on gene evolution. That these results are not significantly different from a dN/dS that is the same for both genes, shows that this pattern is either not a true effect, or that it is subtle in these similar genes. Although the Chi-square test fails to reject the null hypothesis, other evidence suggests that the difference found in the dN/dS o f Smcy and Smcx is real. Neither Smcx nor Smcy has diverged rapidly, although the mean pairwise distance between the Smcy sequences is nearly three times that o f Smcx. A test that is more suitable than maximum likelihood for these similar sequences , showed that Smcy had a significantly higher number o f replacement substitutions than Smcx had. This result is consistent with a three-taxon study of Smcy/x in human, mouse, and horse, in which the median dN/dS was 0.17 for Smcy and 0.02 for Smcx . Although the exact numbers reported by differ from those that we found using other methods, this shows that Smcy has a higher dN/dS in both closely related and distantly related taxa. Widely expressed genes, such as Smcy and Smcx, tend to have a lower dN/dS than genes with limited expression . Possibly, widely expressed genes have more functional constraints than genes expressed only in a few tissues . This may explain the small difference between the dN/dS of Smcy and Smcx compared to the larger difference between Zfy and Zfy in many of the same taxa . Zfy has limited expression and much higher dN/dS than the more widely expressed Zfy . Data from Wyckoff et al also show that the difference in dN/dS between Smcy and Smcx is smaller than the difference in several other X/Y gene pairs in mouse and human. The higher level of replacement substitutions found in Smcy is consistent with a Y chromosomal effect on gene evolution. However, there are alternative explanations. Positive selection on a few codons in particular lineages might cause a pattern of evolution like that seen in Smcy and Smcx, Such selection would not cause the overall dN/dS to be above one, so it would not be distinguishable from inefficient purifying selection, using the methods we have used. Although Smcx escapes X-inactivation in mice , indicating that the two genes require equivalent dosages in males and females, and therefore share a function , more detailed experiments show that the levels of escape from X inactivation vary by tissue type and through development, as well as from cell to cell within early development Sheardown et al. 1996; Lingenfelter et al. 1998 ). For most tissues, it is not known if a need for equivalent gene dosages requires Smcy expression to vary together with expression of Smcx. In the mouse brain, there is a difference in the levels of expression, with female brains expressing more Smcx from both X chromosomes than males express o f Smcx and Smcy combined . If this means that there has been divergence in their function, the observed difference in dN/dS could be due to a few codons in Smcy evolving according to positive natural selection. The results o f this study, combined with the results of studies o f other Y-linked genes in these same taxa strongly suggest that there is a Y chromosomal effect on gene evolution in the genus Mus. Also, in pairwise comparisons of six X/Y gametologs in mouse and human, the dN/dS was always higher in the Y chromosomal gene . Katoh, K. and T. Miyata 1999 .

The male-to-female mutation rate ratio is approximately 2.5, which is similar to previous estimates in more distantly related rodents. Thus, closely related rodent species do not appear to exhibit a lowered male-to-female mutation rate ratio like that found in closely related primates. Several mechanisms cause mutations, including damage to DNA due to mutagens and replication errors . If mutations are caused by mistakes during DNA replication, genetic material that has been replicated many times should have a higher mutation rate than that replicated few times. In mammals, DNA replication occurs more often in the male germline in than the female germline, so the male germ line may be a major source of mutations relative to the female germ line . \"Male-driven evolution\" is the hypothesis that male-originating mutations drive the mutational aspect of evolution.

{"text": "The 95% confidence interval o f a was calculated by substituting Y/X\" and Y/X+ in the rate ratio formula. We made two types of corrections to account for the effect of ancient nucleotide polymorphism on closely related species, following Makova and Li . The first correction was to calculate a for only non-terminal branches. The second correction was made to pairs o f closely related species. Branch lengths along the shortest path between the two species in each pair were added together for Smcx and Smcy, separately. An estimate of ancient nucleotide polymorphism was subtracted from the total branch length for each Smcx comparison. We used the average nucleotide polymorphism ) from four X chromosomal genes in Mus domesticus as an approximation o f ancient nucleotide polymorphism for Smcx. The corrected Smcx branch lengths were used in the equations above to calculate a . Synapomorphies for Smcx and Smcy in the same species were rare, and only one base long, so gene conversion is unlikely to affect this analysis . Most Smcy branch lengths were longer than Smcx branch lengths. Y/X varied greatly among branches, ranging from 0.002 to 10.247. As noted by Chang, Hewett-Emmett, and Li , widely varying Y/X ratios may occur because of random fluctuations due to a small number of observed differences. Following their lead, analyses were based on groups of branches. Adding together all of the branch lengths, we get Y/X = / = 0.2202/0.1270 = 1.734 + /-0.2922. a is 2.7393 . As a correction for ancient nucleotide polymorphism, we also calculated a for terminal and non-terminal branches separately . Y/X for terminal branches is / =1.7109 +/-0.3336. a is 2.6544 For non-terminal branches, Y/X is / = 0.0751/0.0422 = 1.780 +/-0.4650. a is 2.9200 . For the second method o f correcting for ancient nucleotide polymorphism, five pairs of species were chosen to sample different parts of the tree topology. The Smcx branch length for each pair was corrected by subtracting an estimate o f ancient nucleotide polymorphism. Y/X for each species pair was calculated by dividing the total Smcy branch length by the corrected Smcx branch length. The corrected Y/X ratios range from 0 to 33.42857, and a ranges from 0 to infinity . The male to female mutation rate in rodents was previously estimated, from Y/X comparisons, to be about 2 . Our uncorrected results are in agreement with those studies and with the predicted a based on the number of cell divisions in rodent germlines . Our results are also similar to a previous study using Smcy and Smcx in mouse, human, and horse, that found an a of 3 . Their estimate may be higher than ours because it includes human sequences, which generally have a higher a than rodent sequences. The results of this study do not support the conclusion of Makova and Li and that closely related species are unsuitable for analyses of male-driven evolution because they give incorrectly low estimates of a . In this study, a calculated from terminal branch lengths was only slightly lower than a calculated from all branch lengths, a calculated from non-terminal branch lengths was higher than a calculated from all branch lengths. The 95% Cl o f all o f these estimates overlap. In Makova and Li's study the 95% Cl of a calculated from terminal and non-terminal branches also overlapped, but the higher a obtained by examining only non-terminal branches brought their result closer to previous estimates of primate male-driven evolution . In contrast, the increase in a in the current study caused it to diverge from previous estimates in rodents. There is no reason to believe that the non-terminal branches give a more accurate estimate o f a in this case. Correcting for ancient nucleotide polymorphism by subtracting an estimate of j z from the X branch lengths between pairs of species, resulted in different estimates of a , depending on which species pairs were used. Makova and Li had estimated ancient nucleotide diversity based on polymorphism data collected for their study. Polymorphism data were not available for Smcx, so the average it for four X chromosomal genes in a random sample of 10 Mus domesticus, 0.078% , was used. This estimate o f n may not be accurate for this purpose since it is an average calculated from four X chromosomal genes . Additionally, ancestral Mus populations may have had different levels o f polymorphism from extant species. Estimations of a for species pairs varied widely depending on which species were compared. The corrected values also varied widely , and neither support nor refute the utility of correcting for ancient nucleotide polymorphism in this way. Both o f the correction techniques used here were intended to correct for ancient polymorphism on the X chromosome. If there was low polymorphism in the ancestral Mus populations, these corrections would not be expected to have a large effect. Since estimations of a from the terminal and non-terminal branches were similar, it is possible that low polymorphism in the ancestors of Mus is the cause. Data from birds support a faster rate of evolution in males . Since in birds, males are the homogametic sex, the fact that they also show evidence o f male-driven evolution suggests that this effect is not due to some other consequence of male heterogamy in mammals. Plants also show a faster rate of evolution in genetic material that goes through more replications in males Whittle and Johnston 2002) . Despite this evidence, the precise portion of mutations due to male gametogenesis is not known. Different autosomes evolve with different neutral rates, which would not be expected if male-driven evolution is the only force at work . pointed out that autosome-specific mutation rates can be caused by replication-dependent and replication-independent mechanisms, as follows. Replication-dependent effects include: the time during the cell cycle when DNA replication occurs for a particular chromosome , different repair efficiencies per chromosome of replication-caused mutations , and an GC-content effect on mutation or repair during replication . These mutational mechanisms can work in concert with male gametogenesis to cause both a male-driven evolution effect, and different neutral mutation rates for different autosomes . On the other hand, replication-independent effects caused by GC content such as: a bias in gene conversion , or a bias in recombination rates in autosomes , since they found evidence for male-driven evolution by comparing ancestrally homologous sequences from the Y and an autosome, without using X chromosomal sequences. A low mutation rate on the X chromosome may remain a factor in X/Y comparisons such as those reported here. This study adds to the several studies supporting a male to female mutation rate in rodents o f about 2 and shows that this result is not dependent on the analysis of distantly related species.

Over time segments o f DNA were added to both chromosomes. Eventually most o f these segments lost recombination, and most Y genes deteriorated ), genes expressed only in the testis with multiple Y-linked copies, and some genes with a mix o f characteristics ). The X chromosome has remained very conserved during mammalian evolution ). Lahn and Page measured K s, the synonymous distance, between the X and Y members o f gametologs, and discovered that the divergences fell into four distinct groups. Remarkably, the groups corresponded to the order of the X-linked genes along the human X chromosome. The first of these four \"strata\" was formed before the divergence of monotremes ), the second between the divergence of monotremes and marsupials gene Iwase et al. 2003 ). The exact position of the strata break-point is determined by an abrupt change in the K s between physically adjoining DNA sequences, and confirmed by phylogenetic analysis . An inversion in the middle o f the gene would have destroyed its function, so some other mechanism likely is responsible for suppressing recombination in this region . Since three o f the four recombination suppressions occurred before the divergence of primates from other mammals, evidence of these should also be found in non primate mammals, including mice. The ancestral mammalian X chromosomal gene arrangement appears to be retained in humans, since this arrangement is also found in horses , cattle , pigs , and cats . The physical order of genes on the mouse X chromosome has been rearranged relative to the order on other mammalian X chromosomes during evolution . Therefore genes from each stratum will not be found in the same physical order in mice, but the relative order of divergence o f groups of gametologs should be the same as in humans, if the strata theory is correct. The strata theory was tested in mice by calculating the neutral divergence rate using the statistic Ks substitutions per synonymous site) between pairs of genes in Mus musculus. Mouse orthologs that represent genes from each o f the first three strata identified by were used. Additionally, Ks for Smcx/y and Zjx/y-2 was calculated for seven rodent taxa of the genus Mus. These data confirm that strata results obtained for Mus musculus were representative of the genus. At least two orthologous gene pairs from each o f the first three strata identified by were chosen. The fourth stratum is expected to be different in different mammalian orders, since it was formed after the divergence of placental mammals, so the fourth stratum is not examined here. The choice o f gametologs in mice was limited because some genes have been lost from the mouse Y chromosome over evolutionary time. Mus musculus gametolog sequences were obtained from Genbank: Rbmx NM_011252, Rbm ylal NM_11253, Sox3 AF434675, Sry U70654, Usp9x NM_009481, Usp9y NM_148943, Utx XM_135790, Uty AF057367, Eif2s3x NM_012010, Eif2s3y NM _0l20l 1, U belxNM_009457, U belyl NM_0l 1667, Smcx AF127245, Smcy AF127244, Zfic NM_011768 Zfy M24401. Sry and Sox3 do not align outside the HMG box, so only the HMG box region was used . For other genes, the entire alignable coding region was used . For the analysis of multiple species of Mus, Zfx and Zfy-2 were taken from Genbank . Smcx and Smcy sequences o f several Mus species were collected using PCR and sequencing. The genus Mus is a member of the rodent family Muridae and the subfamily Murinae, the Old-world Mice and Rats. Muridae is the largest mammalian family, containing 281 genera and 1326 species . DNA was collected from seven Mus species and subspecies . Genomic DNA was extracted from frozen tissues . The polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify a fragment of Smcy that includes two complete exons in length) and a 9 bp portion of one other exon in all taxa. The beginning of the fragment corresponds to base 3443 and the end to base 4129 of an Smcy sequence from Mus musculus, accession number AF127244, obtained from Genbank. The analogous fragment o f Smcx had exons of 582,70, and 9 bp in length. The beginning o f this fragment corresponds to base 3728 and the end to base 4387 o f an Smcx sequence from Mus musculus, accession number AF127245, obtained from Genbank.

{"text": "No \"hypsilophodonf teeth have been reported from any unit in the Big Bend region, and it seems likely that reports of possible hypsilophodont remains may refer to juvenile hadrosaur or adult pachycephalosaur material. The sauropod dinosaur Alamosaurus sanjuanensis is currently known only from the Javelina Formation and upper El Picacho Formation . While Alamosaurus has recently been labeled a form taxon by Sullivan and Lucas , form taxa are not employed under any nomenclatural code applicable to vertebrates. The characteristics of Alamosaurus sanjuanensis are well founded , and are being explored by Coulson and Lehman . It is perhaps significant that sauropod and hadrosaur fossils are never found in association in the Trans-Pecos Region . Much ofthe remaining vertebrate fauna of Trans-Pecos Texas consists of pterosaurs, crocodilians, chelonians, and fish, and the pterosaur Quetzalcoatlus northropi, along with a smaller, unnamed species ofthe same genus are known from the Javelina Formation . At least four crocodilian taxa are present in the section, including Deinosuchus riograndensis from the McKinney Springs tongue ofthe Pen Formation, the Terlingua Creek Sandstone, and the upper shale member ofthe Aguja Formation, Goniopholis cf. G. kirtlandicus from the lower and upper shale members and the Javelina Formation, and two other taxa known only from teeth . A great variety of chelonian taxa, most not identifiable below the generic level, are present in Big Bend . Amiid and lepisosteid fish are found throughout the section . Articulated, or even associated, hadrosaur material is rare in Big Bend National Park. This may indicate a bias in collecting, especially as most prospecting has been conducted in the eastem part ofthe Park, where exposures are largely confined to the lowermost upper shale member. It is possible that articulated specimens will eventually be recovered from higher in the section, in coastal or inland floodplain facies, representing environments where rapid burial may have been more likely. Lehman's general observations about the disarticulation sequence of ceratopsians appear to hold for hadrosaurs as well. Lehman points out that the representation of ceratopsian skeletal elements at sites in the Aguja Formation is consistent with a disarticulation sequence from distal to proximal, as is commonly observed in the disarticulation of corpses in the presence of water . This interpretation is consistent with the taphonomic scenarios presented below. Several hadrosaur specimens from Big Bend show what appears to be unusually complete preservation ofthe pes or both the pes and manus. This would generally be interpreted as indicating subaerial disarticulation . It should be remembered, however, that none of these specimens were actually discovered in a state of physical articulation. With the exception of some theropods most dinosaurs retain discrete, but often tightly appressed, metatarsi. This may be associated with the need for shock absorption in these generally large animals. Even among some theropods with tightly appressed metatarsals, pedal kinesis has been hypothesized in connection with shock absorption .These loose articulations may then be associated with extensive syndysmotic joints and a network ligamentous tissue tightly binding the metatarsus. In hadrosaurs, the metatarsus and metacarpus are tightly appressed, probably ligament-bound stmctures, and it is possible that the ligaments retarded the progress of disarticulation. The manus and pes may then have separated from the antebrachium or epipodium, respectively, as part ofthe ordinary disarticulation sequence, but at a stage of disarticulation well prior to that at which the manus or pes itself completely dissociated. These skeletal units would then have behaved as independent elements. Being somewhat larger than their component elements, they would have exhibited different hydraulic characteristics . They may have been transported less easily, increasing the potential for their representation with the large and more steadfast portions ofthe skeleton. At localities where the metatarsus is represented , most, if not all ofthe metatarsals are present, along with a substantial portion ofthe pedal phalanges. Often, many manual elements are also present ; TMM 42452, interpreted here as a heavily current winnowed specimen, preserves all but the distalmost phalanges ofthe manus. When discussing transport of elements, it is important to keep in mind the transient nature of transported bone. The presence of easily transported elements at a site may indicate that the assemblage is largely intact, however, it may also indicate an assemblage made up wholly or in large part of transported bone. Assemblages ofthe former type will have a high proportion of elements resistant to transport, relative to the latter type. Lehman proposed that the comparison ofthe number of vertebrae and ribs in a ceratopsian or hadrosaur deposit might be compared with the number of other elements to assess the degree of transport ofthe specimen. In the case of hadrosaurs, it seems clear that this measure must be modified, as hadrosaur skull bones appear to be very easily transported. In Figure 20 , they are included along with vertebrae and ribs. One caveat for this application of Lehman's method is that it was originally based on the assumption that there are approximately the same number of vertebrae and ribs as other elements in the skeleton ofthe animals considered . Unlike ceratopsians, hadrosaurs have a considerable caudal skeleton; the proportion is approximately 60% as calculated by Lehman. As calculated above, the proportion of ribs and vertebrae to remaming skeletal elements in hadrosaurs is closer to 70%. However, the resulting index illustrates relationships similar to those proposed here, suggesting that it may nonetheless be a useful statistic. The baseline for comparison should be ahered to around a 70% vertebrae and rib fraction for hadrosaurs, as show n in Figure 20 . As shown by Lehman , Voorhies' have pointed out that the effect of incomplete disarticulation on the representation of faunal elements cannot be stressed sufficiently. The hadrosaur metacarpus and metatarsus appear to be preserved more readily than would otherwise be indicated. Caudal vertebrae appear to be more resistant to transport than other vertebrae due to their size. Additionally, in life they were bound by a lattice of ossified tendons, which appears to favor disarticulation into segments of several vertebrae , and probably increased their resistance to transport. In many Alberta hadrosaurs, the tail is incompletely known, presumably because of progressive loss of distal elements . This may be a strong indication of locally differing taphonomic regimes. The head, neck and cranial dorsal vertebrae, which were not held together by ossified tendons, disarticulated early in decomposition , allowing these elements to be winnowed rapidly. The hadrosaur neck was supported by strong nuchal ligaments, probably connecting altemate vertebrae, as in birds , and not was connected to the \"withers\" as reconstmcted by Paul after the pattem in ungulates. Evidence for such powerful ligaments is present in the extreme recurvature ofthe neck in articulated hadrosaur skeletons, which curvature appears to sometimes extend onto the dorsum and distort the ventral flexure ofthe back . The neck may have indeed been swan-like and only weakly muscled {contra Czerkas, 1993) , as it is commonly restored, which would have greatly contributed to its easy disarticulation. Although not common, skulls of hadrosaurs are sometimes encountered in near isolation {e.g., TMM 41442-1; Head, 1998; Sternberg, 1953) . This indicates that the skull sometimes remained articulated as a unit during transport. Such sites usually yield a small quantity of bone from representation group II . Presumably, a whole skull, at least a non-lambeosaurine skull, would belong to that representation group. Lehman observed that the ceratopsian cranium apparently exhibited taphonomic behavior different from that of mammal skulls, in that it commonly disarticulated prior to burial. Thus, the skull was not transported as a single unit, as in mammals. This is also tme of hadrosaurs, which lacked the large, tightly integrated cranial elements of ceratopsians. The preponderance of articulated hadrosaur skulls in the famous latest Cretaceous hadrosaur-bearing strata of northem North America appears to be an artifact of special preservation, and is not characteristic of other regions. Table 1 also presents a tabulation of representation groups ofhadrosaur cranial elements, which are numbered so as to be approximately equivalent to the representation groups for postcrania. Outside of Big Bend, the hadrosaur dentary is the most commonly encountered skull bone, while within the region, the maxilla predominates. It is possible that collection bias may account for part of this, as cranial bones are considered more diagnostic. However, the common occurrence of maxillae may have more to do with the combined robustness and ease of transport ofthe maxilla. Significantly, maxillae are often encountered in deposits containing a high percentage of transported material {e.g., levee-type and some tidal creek-type settings). The maxilla may simply be closer in hydrodynamic characteristics to elements likely to attract the attention of collectors. Localities are here described by \"study area\" , these names being applied informally for the purpose of this study. Detailed information is on file at the .-21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 106 Discussion.-This locality presents a variation on the typical tidal creek deposits ofthe upper shale member. The specimen is intimately associated with inclined, rhythmic interbeds of siltstone and hgnite. The disarticulated, slightly winnowed, and apparently current-aligned nature ofthe specimen suggests that it was deposited on the streambed, and subsequently covered by point bar deposits. The association of small oysters with the site probably attests to the presence of brackish conditions, and the rhythmic lithological heterogeneity ofthe channel deposits argue for a paralic, tidally influenced setting. The grain size difference between the channel deposits and the surrounding mudstones suggests a stream carrying a substantial sediment load derived from outside the coastal marsh and swamp belt environment. This does not appear uncommon in the lower shale member at the Rattlesnake Mountain study area, and may suggest that many of these were true coastal streams draining small but relatively extensive areas ofthe coastal plain rather than just interdistributary marshes. This deposit represents a single burial, with the preserved elements somewhat channelized along an approximate east-west axis, and preserves many easily winnowed elements. The left manus, parts of at least one pes, and parts ofthe skull and cervical series were preserved along with parts ofthe pelvis, while the remaining elements of representation groups I and II were winnowed away by current action. The complete absence of representation group III suggests that the preserved portions ofthe skeleton had already moved some ways down stream from where the body first entered the water. It is possible, however, that these elements were present at the site but were concealed beneath the overburden, and were simply not found. The manus and part ofthe skull of this specimen were partially encmsted with iron oxide cements . These element groups were somewhat disarticulated, indicating that they may have been loosely bound by rotting flesh. Carbonized plant debris, abundant in the surrounding sediments, was found in the core of both groups. -26, 27, 28, 29, 104 Discussion.-This site is also a typical levee microvertebrate site. Abundant material from this site may represent a new species of turtle . The hadrosaur maxilla from this site is much larger than the other material at the site, approached in size only by some pieces of turtle. Especially unusual is the preservation of the medial wall ofthe alveolar chamber, and pieces of a number of teeth were also recovered. This suggests that the maxilla was transported intact, with the teeth in place; this must have been a rather dense sedimentary particle. As with site TMM 42534, the presence of a maxilla indicates the possibility of substantial flow velocities during initial -15, 31, 32, 33, 107 Discussion.-The bones were recovered from a dark grey mudstone at the base of a chaotically-bedded very fine sandstone layer containing reworked concretions, carbonaceous plant fragments, the bones listed here, and shell fragments . The upper and lower contacts ofthe sandstone unit are undulose, and the unit appears to represent part of an inclined, heterolithic set. A previously unidentified form of bivalve shell was recovered from above the level ofthe sandstone bed in a very finegrained sandstone unit. While the maxilla, a rib, and the theropod tooth were recovered from just below the sandstone, the chevron and vertebrae were found in the sandstone along with another rib fragment and the crocodilian tooth . Although the possibility of a substantial time lag between the deposition of these elements cannot be discounted, it seems reasonable to assume that all ofthe hadrosaur elements belong to the same animal, and the bones and sandstone may represent parts ofthe same depositional event. It is likely that the animal's remains were worked into a stream channel, and subsequent flooding resulted in entombment within, or just below, the sandstone. All ofthe elements present are believed to be easily transported , and are all roughly cylindrical, and thus probably exhibited similar hydrodynamic behavior . This suggests that the assemblage was transported. An hypothetical sequence of events might begin with the death ofthe animal within the stream, or close enough to be worked into it without calling on floodwaters as the agent of initial transport. The body disarticulated in place during a period of low flow stage in the stream. The next flood stage transported much ofthe skeleton downstream, depositing skeletal elements along with its sediment load as the stream lost energy. Between flood stages, the stream retiuned to a low-energy environment, and was recolonized by a faima including bivalves and other burrowmg animals, which turbated the sandstone substrate and would ultimately contribute their skeletal elements to the sediment load ofthe next flood pulse. This deposit is therefore interpreted to represent channel deposit, although perhaps not directly comparable to deposits recognized as such in other areas . The ephemeral nature of high energy flow hypothesized here would allow for the more ready preservation of bone, and the significant accumulation of mud-sized sediment between flood stages might shield bones from reentrainment and the destructive consequences of continual transport . Cycles of flood-stage reactivation of generally quiet waters such as those hypothesized here fall within the category of channel fill deposits presented by Behrensmeyer . She notes that standing water in inactive channels may support stands of vegetation, and may attract animals {ibid. p. 193), similar to the situation hypothesized above for stream channels. Lehman 1982 , Davies 1983 Lithostratigraphy.-upper shale member, Aguja Formation Hadrosaur specimens.-\"WPA 3 individual\" of Davies Figure 2 and Plate 1 of Lehman Discussion.-The WPA quarries are discussed in detail by Lehman and Davies . All ofthe hadrosaur bones from the WPA 3 quarry are quite large, and there is only one case of duplication of elements . The matching pedes, hindlimb elements, and the presence of two ilia and two ischia lead Davies to suggest that all but one ofthe bones from the WPA 3 locality represent a single individual. Davies' mensural comparison of this specimen to Kritosaurus notabilis {= K incurvimanus), met with results that fell within 10% of each other for the long-bones ofthe hindlimb and the ischium. Qualitatively, this value is a more than acceptable, as the specimen used for comparison is much smaller , and, in most dinosaurs, hindlimb proportions change with growth {e.g., Holtz 1994 ). Study Area.-Talley Mountain Site Number.-\"WPA 3\" of While the ilium and ischia are roughly the same size, detailed comparison suggests that they are not in the proportions that would be expected if they belonged to the same animal, a conclusion also evident from Davies' data. It is worth noting that the ilium is incomplete. However, authors {ibid, and this study) are not in agreement regarding the amount of length missing , although any reasonable amount is not likely to constitute much of a difference. Assuming that the lengths recorded by Lull and Wright are all entirely incompatible, resulting in an almost 5% error in ischiadic length, and that Davies' reconstmction is correct, the ischium falls within one standard deviation ofthe mean. The only evidence linking ilium P.37.7.222 to the remaining bones from the WPA 3 locality is its large size and association with single or paired elements from the rear half of a large hadrosaur. Physical attempts to fit ischium UTEP P.37.7.220 to ilium UTEP P.37.7.222 proved equivocal; it is possible that the bones do not fit properly, although the size ofthe elements, their state of preservation, and the possibility of a cartilaginous pad at the joint prevent a definitive statement on the matter. Davies' own calculations show the ilium to be much shorter than expected for an up-scaled Kritosaurus notabilis , as well as much wider. Also, these comparisons were made with a specimen that appears to have a short ilium relative to other specimens of Kritosaurus. Davies suggests that a quarry photograph {ibid., Plate I.l, Figure 36 of this study) may indicate that ilium UTEP P.37.7.222 was found closely associated with another ilium , and possibly the ischia recovered at the site. However, this photo shows WPA workers standing on the quarry floor, \"preparing [the bones] for plastering,\" according to the quoted caption. The arrangement ofthe bones suggests that they had been recognized as similar elements, but little can be said about morphological similarities, since no details can be made out. There is no compelling ev idence to associate ihum UTEP P.37.7.222 widi the remainder ofthe postcrania. Given the preservation of ossified ligaments, and possible ligamentous binding of these elements during transport, it is interesting that neither the sacrum, to which hadrosaur iha are tightly bound, nor any ofthe caudal dorsal vertebrae, to which the ilia are attached by ossified ligaments are found in the WPA 3 collection. One would expect a sacrum freed from its ilia to have hydrodynamic properties similar to the linked caudal vertebrae found at the site . Ilia themselves would have peculiar hydrodynamic properties, presumably much different from the remaining elements in the assemblage, which are all less plate-like. TMM 42309 contains two left ilia of nearly the same size, as well as three ischia, caudal vertebrae, haemal arches, and a rib. The WPA 3 quarry may contain pelvic material from two or more similarly sized hadrosaurs, but vertebral material from only one of them The remaining postcrania are more robust than isometrically scaled elements of A^. ''incurvimanus,\" which is not surprising given the size difference in the specimens compared. There appears to be no reason to dispute their association, and this is tentatively accepted. This assessment is also supported by information on the Works Progress Administration excavations themselves. Quarrying at site WPAl was abandoned when the excavation reached a point where the overburden was too deep to continue, and WPA2 was closed when bone ceased to be found, but WPA3 was abandoned when the project was terminated . The collection from WPA 3 then does not necessarily represent the complete deposit, and the hypothesis that nearly all ofthe material corresponds to a single animal relies on negative evidence, the absence of extensive material from another animal. -25, 39, 40, 41, 42 Discussion.-The presence of thick concretionary coverings on nearly all bones greatly complicates identifications. Table 3 represents a best approximation ofthe recovered elements from this site. The table is somewhat misleading, in that some elements are represented only by fragments, and some numbers are minima based on a number of fragmentary specimens. Since collection was concentrated in the area from which the maxillae were recovered, the site was unevenly sampled. Elements ofthe smaller hadrosaur were undoubtedly left uncollected. This sample appears to consist of less transportable elements, mostly of representation group II or III . It appears that the assemblage has been winnowed by current action, but not extensively. Unfortunately, the heavily damaged and encmsted nature ofthe specimens makes them nearly useless for serious systematic work. Mosaic fracturing, often infilled with concretionary matrix, splintery fracture with the grain ofthe bone, and minor abrasion mostly comparable to Stage 1 of Behrensmeyer all suggest that this material was exposed at the surface for some time prior to burial. Although several bones exhibit more severe weathering, this is not unexpected . The presence of highly weathered, rounded and smoother \"bone pebbles\" indicates some long-lived \"background\" bone . However, most ofthe elements present show a roughly comparable degree of preburial weathering. Recent weathering is evident on most specimens, and is easily distinguished by the separation of blocky fragments perpendicular to the grain ofthe bone , often resulting in the complete removal of all cortical bone on the specimen. These cracks often penetrate the surrounding diagenetic concretion. Bones ofthe smaller hadrosaur exhibit a ropey or \"woven\" texture similar to that described by Behrensmeyer as \"type 3\" weathering. However, the areas which show this are mostly around the neural arches of vertebrae. Hadrosaur neural arches observed at this locality and others {e.g., TMM 41442) characteristically show a \"woven\", remodeled texture. It seems likely that the thin cortical bone ofthe specimens was completely removed as the concretionary coating spalled off, a commonly observed phenomenon at the site, resulting in the exposure ofthe tme bone texture below. This site, then, appears to represent two single burials of hadrosaurs, a large adult and a juvenile, which may or may not have died together. The other remains in the assemblage appear to constitute background and sparse transported elements. 40, 43, 44, 45 Discussion.-If the excavation pit at this site is correctly identified, the specimen was recovered from tan clay just below a channel deposit. Some extraneous bone fragments were located at the site, and appear to confirm that the pit was indeed fossiliferous at one point. Since Brown's notes were not consulted, and the specimen has not yet been examined, little more can be said. It is possible that this site represents a levee deposit, although it would be one ofthe lowest, stratigraphically. Discussion.- Davies presented stratigraphic columns of this locality . Although he suggested that the two columns were at different heights in the section, in this area very little ofthe Aguja Formation is exposed above the Terlingua Creek Sandstone Member. It seems most likely that this site is in the Terlingua Creek Sandstone itself, or just above it. This site contains only elements considered \"highly transportable\" , and is almost certainly a transported assemblage. It is not surprising that it contains the remains ofthe pelvis and tail of two very similarly sized hadrosaurs; the represented elements probably had very similar hydrodynamic properties has described the rare, hadrosaur bearing facies ofthe Javelina Formation as being \"Aguja-like.\" ", "meta": {"ref_id": "Wagner"}}

{"text": "Indeed, this situation bears witness to the inherent lack of meaning in Linnaean ranks, as the same set of species, with the same hypothesized exclusive relationships, may be accommodated at three separate supraspecific ranks . Note that I am uncertain regarding the ancestral shape ofthe hadrosaur dentary. Although the rostral end is deflected ventrally in most non-hadrosaurid hadrosaurs, this may or may not be homologous with the deep ventral flexure ofthe mandibular ramus in Hadrosaurinae {sensu stricto) and Lambeosaurinae, or even whether these latter two conditions are homologous. The phylogenetic hypothesis accepted here . Is equivocal on the matter: the flexed condition in these two groups might be homologous and symplesiomorphic for the group, with the situation in Brachylophosaurus considered a convergent with that in Saurolophinae, or they may be convergent, with the condition in Brachylophosaurus and Saurolophinae being symplesiomorphic. HADROSA URINAE Lambe 1918 Definition. However, the preserved material is very similar to that of Kritosaurus, a fact alluded to by several authors . This association is fiirther supported here, allowing the referral of Kritosaurus to Hadrosaurinae. Although all so-called \"flat-headed\" hadrosaurids were suspicious of all but the type species of Hadrosaurus, although they believed that the species was valid. Hadrosaurus foulkii was distinguished from Edmontosaurus annectens by those authors using four characters: the craniocaudally short proximal caudal vertebrae, the more pronounced rake of the middorsal neural spines, the morphology ofthe teeth, and the distinctive ilium of Hadrosaurus foulkii. Examination of illustrations ofthe vertebrae of Hadrosaurus foulkii reveals their strongly opisthocoelous nature, which suggests that they are, in fact, cranial dorsals. Such a degree of angulation is often observed in hadrosaur cranial dorsal centra. As discussed below, the length of proximal caudal centra appears to vary with position, from long at the proximal and distal extrema to short near the base ofthe tail. Proportions of these vertebrae have not been analyzed systematically, but there does not appear to be any evidence to support this distinction. The difference in dental morphology appears to stem from the apomorphically short tooth crowns of Edmontosaurus annectens. Hadrosaurus can not be supported, as papillation is variable throughout the toothrow of hadrosaurids . The teeth are short , relative to non-Kritosaurus hadrosaurs other than Edmontosaurus annectens . The pelvis of Hadrosaurus foulkii is certainly different than that of Edmontosaurus. In these cases, the morphology observed in Hadrosaurus foulkii is ancestral, and of little use in referring the species. Baird and Homer synonymized Hadrosaurus with Kritosaurus, a change widely acknowledged and adopted, and one which has influenced reconstmctions and popular accounts ever since. These authors gave no evidence for this referral, and, in abstract form, the proposed synonymy was hardly a compelling nomenclatural act. This view has been subsequently abandoned by most authors, generally without comment. Davies set out to graphically demonstrate that Kritosaurus and Hadrosaurus were not synonymous by comparing elements ofthe type ofthe latter genus using illustrations of ROM 4514 and MCSNM v345 {K. notabilis [Pinna, 1979] ). Although Davies suggests, quite reasonably, that the similar size ofthe first two specimens should make comparison quite reasonable, he does not account for the possibility that different growth rates in different species, and possibly even different individuals, might cause individuals ofthe same size to reflect proportions associated with later ontogenetic stages in others. In this regard, Davies' comparisons ofthe caudal vertebrae of these two genera are unconvincing. Since the angulation ofthe caudal neural spine varies through the series, it is likely that the vertebrae he compared were from different parts ofthe tail. This is confirmed by the craniocaudally thicker neural spines ofthe Kritosaurus vertebrae, which are indicative of proximal caudals. Davies notes that the Hadrosaurus vertebrae have a traverse process, yet one ofthe more shallowly inclined Kritosaurus vertebrae does not, implying it is from more distal in the column. However, ofthe four proximal caudals illustrated by Pinna , Davies chose the two with the least inclined neural spines. The twelfth and sixteenth caudals show much more pronounced caudal rakes which compare well with the representative vertebra of Hadrosaurus foulkii . Additionally, the \"rake\" ofthe neural spines on hadrosaur caudal vertebrae changes throughout the column, being steepest distally, but also most proximally, and approximately one-third ofthe distance along the tail at the \"transition point\" . Davies ' comparison of femora shows small differences in the shapes ofthe proximal and distal ends, the head, and the fourth trochanter. However, the head ofthe femur of ROM 4514 was reconstmcted by Parks , and the proximal and distal ends ofthe femur of Hadrosaurus foulkii appear to be abraded, especially the greater trochanter. Overall the correspondence of these bones is good, and the differences can reasonably be attributed to individual variation. The same is almost certainly tme ofthe humems, as the difference noted by Carpenter is quite modest. Indeed, the difference in that bone is so slight as to be almost imperceptible in cranial view, and, were one not told the outlines of Davies were of different bones, one might readily believe they were the same bone viewed from slightly different angles. Davies' comparison ofthe metatarsals of these animals is complicated by the fact that he compares metatarsal III of Kritosaurus notabilis with an isolated metatarsal IV attributed to Hadrosaurus foulkii . The latter bone agrees well with metatarsal IV of Kritosaurus. However, Davies has pointed out, and Hunt and Lucas echoed, that the pelvis of Hadrosaurus foulkii is different in outline from that of ROM 4514. This observation is comphcated by a number of factors. Parks' drawing ofthe latter bone does not match his photograph, being too thick and elliptical rostrally, too broad caudally, the iliac peduncle being too short. The photo matches TMM 42309-2, AMNH 8053 and other ilia referable to Kritosaurus very well, although it still shows subtle differences in the outline ofthe dorsal margin, and the short preacetabular process. Both of these may be the result of postmortem deformation and breakage, respectively. In any case, restoration ofthe ilium of Hadrosaurus foulkii is also somewhat suspect. From illustrations and photos, the dorsal margin appears cmshed, obscuring the development ofthe overhanging rim and bending the antitrochanter dorsally. Although heavily restored, the base ofthe preacetabular process appears to have been flattened somewhat, exaggerating differences relative to Kritosaurus in the shape of the embayment dorsal to the pubic peduncle. While the dorsal margin ofthe caudal process is angled dorsally as in Kritosaurus and non-hadrosaurids, fragments ofthe ventral margin have been reassembled to form a strange shape which more closely resembles the more horizontal postacetabular process of non-Kritosaurus hadrosaurids. From illustrations , this reconstmction appears dubious. Further, it creates a ventral inflection or pendant ventral knob unknown in other hadrosaurs. Waterhouse Hawkins' cast reconstmction of Hadrosaurus foulkii shows a smooth ventral margin , suggesting that he too lacked confidence in this aspect of Leidy's reconstmction . Davies asserts that the differences in the ilium that separate Hadrosaurus foulkii and Kritosaurus spp. are as great as those which separate the latter species from Saurolophus. It seems clear that, from the perspective of discrete characters, the greatest apparent difference among these bones is 132 found among the ilia Davies {ibid.) referred to Kritosaurus sp. . On the other hand, many ofthe differences between the ilia of Kritosaurus notabilis, Saurolophus maximus and S. osborni are the result of reconstmction in the latter . Ilia ANSP 10005 and TMM 42309-2 appear more similar to each other than either they do to any other hadrosaur ilium. That their lateral outlines differ, especially in the possibly greater dorsal inflection ofthe postacetabular process in the latter, is cause for caution. In light ofthe deformity and ambiguity ofthe type of Hadrosaurus foulkii, and , which does not recognize obhgatory taxa, the will not apply to genera and species at first, a genus name must be selected. It seems best to retain Hadrosaurus as valid and nomenclaturally distinct from Kritosaurus until the type species is better known. It seems appropriate, additionally, to restrict this genus to the type species until another species can be demonstrated to be more closely related to it than to another species. Should Hadrosaurus foulkii be found to be part of a clade with some species of Kritosaurus and not others, the data may then be sufficient to confirm the validity of Hadrosaums.

Gryposaurus was synonymized with Kritosaurus by authors ahnost immediately upon its pubhcation , and that synonymy was accepted for many years. Recentiy, Homer separated the two taxa on the assertion that Kritosaurus navajovius lay phylogenetically closer to Saurolophus osborni within the widely recognized {e.g., Weishampel and Homer, 1990; Weishampel et al, 1993; Homer, 1992) Edmontosaurus-Saurolophus clade . Indeed, Homer postulated that Kritosaurus lay closer to Saurolophus osborni than to \"Prosaurolophus\"\" maximus on the shared possession of a crest which extends caudally over the frontals, nasals which penetrate between the frontals on the midline ofthe skull roof, and broad medial overlap ofthe prefrontals onto the nasals.

All these features are synapomorphic for Saurolophinae. The postcranium of Kritosaurus navajovius, although poorly known, lacks the apomorphically reduced dorsal neural spines of saurolophines . Kritosaurus also does not exhibit \"coalescence\" ofthe circumnarial fossae over the intemarial bar, a slitlike narial foramen, a slightly reduced buccal cavity caused by a lateral bulge on the dentary in front ofthe coronoid process, and eversion ofthe prefrontal margin as a ridge lateral to the circumnarial fossa, all of which are characteristic of Saurolophus {sensu lato). Another character mentioned by Homer have resulted in the noted \"w\"-shaped suture . This is supported by the fact that the nasofrontal suture in K. notabilis is in a position rostral to that in K navajovius . The overlap ofthe nasals by the prefrontals may be a common stmctural adaptation to support the crest, explaining its convergent development in high-crested species of Saurolophus and Kritosaurus. Kritosaurus and Gryposaurus as synonyms is a matter of nomenclatural/za^ There has never been an objective basis for genus-level separation of members of an exclusive group. Given the historically recognized synonymy of these genera, the general disutility of monospecific genera, and the \"lumping\" predilections ofthe author, synonymy is here retained for Kritosaurus and Gryposaurus. Note that species of Kritosaurus are presented out ofthe conventional order here to preserve the phylogenetically hierarchical format ofthe text. Kritosaurus latidens Synonymy.-Gryposaurus latidens Revised Diagnosis.-Extensive premaxillary palate with a socket ventrally for the rostrodorsal process ofthe maxilla; mandibular teeth very broad . Age.-Early Campanian Discussion.-\"Gryposaurus\" latidens was recognized by Homer based on remains of an animal very similar to Kritosaurus notabilis, but with a more \"robust\" humems, wider dentary teeth, some mesial examples of which have \"split\" median carinae, and a socket in the premaxilla for the rostrodorsal process ofthe maxilla. He ftirther suggested {ibid.) that, since some of these features were \"primitive\" for hadrosaurines {sensu Homer 1988 Homer , 1990 Homer , 1992 , this species was a \"metataxon\" lacking evidence of monophyly. The synthetic approach to species adopted here . As explained below, currently available evidence fails to support the claim that specimens referred to this species have an exceptionally elongate humems . The resemblance of tooth morphology of this species to that of earlier iguanodontians, such as Camptosaurus and Iguanodon {e.g., Norman 1990a), in the \"split\" carinae and wide enameled faces ofthe teeth appears to represent homoplasies, and not plesiomorphy. Consensus of phylogenetic hypotheses presented by all current workers places a number of taxa {e.g., Bactrosaurus johnsoni, Protohadros byrdi, Telmatosaurus transylvanicus) closer to hadrosaurids. All of these have narrower teeth and show progressive reduction of all but the median carina. This strongly indicates that this morphology constitutes an autapomorphic reversal . The divided carinae of Kritosaurus latidens may also be pathological, and as their relationship to secondary ridges is unproven . It seems best not to place too much emphasis upon them. Kritosaurus latidens is then characterized only by its wide teeth, which appear to be consistent among specimens , and the presence of articular sockets for the rostrodorsal process ofthe maxilla in the premaxillary palate. This latter state is indicative of a general elongation ofthe premaxillary palate , which extends caudodorsally, surrounding the rostrodorsal processes in articulation. As the maxilla is only illustrated in lateral view, it is not possible to determine whether there are corresponding modifications ofthe rostrodorsal process. The species is also characterized by plesiomorphies, including the rostral placement ofthe peak ofthe narial crest , and the consequently wide nasal contribution to the narial foramen. Homer's reconstmction ofthe skull of Kritosaurus latidens shows the premaxilla sitting well above the maxilla rather than lapping it laterally. This position provides almost no physical contact between the two bones. From the illustration provided , the premaxilla of AMNH 5465 appears distorted, and it seems most likely that the premaxilla lapped the maxilla laterally as in other species of Kritosaurus. This is home out by the illustration of a maxilla referred to this species , which appears to show a standard Kritosaurus articular surface for the premaxilla on the lateral face ofthe rostroventral process. \"incurvimanus \") . This feature may also be observed in photographs ofthe type of that species , and TMM 42314-1 from the Oldman Formation of Alberta , which is also referable to K notabilis . In contrast, the third maxillary foramen of Kritosaurus navajovius observation that these foramina are often cmshed closed or not prepared or illustrated, making evaluation of variation in their pattems somewhat problematic. It is also worth noting that foramen II in species of Saurolophus is enlarged, and is set in a fossa. In some illustrations it appears to be two foramina . This condition, however, appears to be distinct from that observed in Big Bend and San Juan Basin specimens, and the lack of similar morphology in Brachylophosaurus peeblesorum , Edmontosaurus regalis , and Lambeosaurinae suggests that this feature is convergent. In Kritosaurus latidens and K sp. nov. , the nasal arch extends broadly rostrally , encompassing a rostrocaudally broad narial foramen. In contrast, the nasal arch is \"laid\" caudally against the \"brow\" ofthe skull in adult \"male\" K. notabilis and especially K navajovius, in which this condition is present even in an apparently subadult, possibly female specimen . This difference is difficult to quantify, especially given the absence of complete specimens of either ofthe former two taxa. However, the easier transition from the more rostrally placed arch in K latidens and K. sp. nov. to the long ancestral, nearly straight nasals of forms such as Iguanodon bernissartensis , Bactrosaurus johnsoni , and Gilmoreosaurus mongoliensis suggests that this is the ancestral condition . On the other hand, Lophorothon atopus has a nasal crest set close to the \"brow\" ofthe skull , and a similar crest has been restored for a mounted reconstmction of Secemosaurus australis study remains a comerstone ofhadrosaur osteology, and has made the species a pivotal part of our understanding of hadrosaurs. It has previously been synonymized with K. navajovius by Brett-Surman and Hunt and Lucas , although, at the time, the latter species was very poorly known. Differences in the nasal arch, maxilla, and prepubic process ofthe pubis readily separate these species; sample size is too small to confirm other reported differences . Parks named Kritosaurus incurvimanus on the basis of ROM 4514, a superbly preserved skeleton, including a partial skull, from the Judith River Group of Alberta. Although this species has been widely accepted by many authors {e.g., Carrano et al, 1999; Homer, 1992; Lull and Wright, 1942; Pinna, 1979; Weishampel and Homer, 1990 ), others have suggested that it may represent a sexual dimorph ofK. notabilis. The primary features used by that Parks to distinguish this animal from Kritosaurus notabilis were the smaller size, lack ofthe orbital emargination Lambe observed in the type of Kritosaurus notabilis, a somewhat different shape ofthe orbit, greater separation of the jugal and quadrate below the infratemporal fenestra, the more rostral position ofthe narial crest , and the presence of several wedge-shaped manual phalanges. Parks also mentions the presence of a fourth manual phalanx in the context of differentiating the species from other genera, as the manus of Kritosaurus was otherwise unknown at the time. The absence ofthe \"emargination\" observed by Lambe in other specimens ofK. notabilis {e.g., Pinna, 1979; Weishampel and Homer, 1990) suggests that it represents little more than damage to the prefrontal bone dorsolateral to the lacrimal canal. The smaller size is easily attributed to the skeleton belonging to a younger animal, and the shape ofthe orbit may be due to this as well. Further, the distinctive \"knotted brow\" shape ofthe orbit in other Kritosaurus specimens is partially due to the abmpt inward flexure ofthe bones surrounding the orbital foramen immediately medial to the orbital fenestra itself Specimens in which this intemal emargination is not exposed due to incomplete preparation , or is obscured through distortion have much less \"stem\" countenance. Separation of the jugal and quadrate is a feature which is variable with the state of preservation of a specimen, and therefore of dubious systematic value. Examination of the jugal and quadratojugal of TMM 42452-1, and the quadrate of TMM 41442-1, suggests that the quadratojugal and quadrate were bound together in life by soft tissues, while the jugal and quadratojugal most likely met at a sliding lap joint. This scheme is opposite that advocated by Weishampel , but constitutes a better explanation for the stmcture ofthe relevant joints, and for the observed variability in the positions of these bones. The presence of a more rostrally placed nasal crest, inferred by Parks from the lack of a preserved crest in his skull, is confirmed by RTMP 80.22.1 , a small specimen which is presently undescribed. This specimen shows that Park's reconstmction was too long in the snout, and the crest of this morphotype, rather than being simply more rostrally placed, is extremely reduced. RTMP 80.22.1 shows only a very subtle dorsoventral thickening ofthe intemarial bar that barely rises above the plane ofthe skull roof . The characters ofthe manus listed by Parks are discussed elsewhere . They are not at all anomalous, and do not justify the erection of a new species. Of other differences among the named species of Kritosaurus listed by Davies , none appears to be significant. However, Homer points out two additional differences in justifying the separation of \"Gryposaurus latidens\" and \"Gryposaurus incurvimanus'' from Kritosaurus navajovius.

{"text": "Indeed, the observation ofthe \"light\" and shallow\" nature of the jugal in Brachylophosaurus may be extended with little reservation to Kritosaurus . That the maxillary process of the jugal in Brachylophosaurus is in the form of an isosceles triangle is symplesiomorphic; the elongate form ofthe triangle is seen in some Kritosaurus. It is possible that the form ofthe maxillary articulation of the jugal in Brachylophosaurus could be constmed as an autapomorphy ofthe genus, as Homer has provided some evidence that this process is, to some extent, diagnostic ofhadrosaur species . Some ofthe symplesiomorphies reported in justification ofthe exclusion of these forms from the rest ofthe Hadrosauridae, such as the broad nasal, short shelf over the foramen magnum and the wide caudal portion ofthe skull are very difficult to evaluate. The first is phrased in a manner difficult to interpret. It appears, however, to be autapomorphic for Brachylophosaurus , as such broad nasals are not present in non-hadrosaurid hadrosaurs. The nature ofthe overhang on the foramen magnum is very difficult to evaluate, as much depends on the degree to which a specimen is cmshed; it may represent little more than another autapomorphy of Brachylophosaurus. The wide \"postorbital\" portion ofthe skull appears to be a misinterpretation. Although Kritosaurus certainly is transversely wide through the quadrates, Brachylophosaurus seems little wider than other hadrosaurids, especially relative to the width through the postorbitals themselves {e.g., figures in Heaton [1972] ). Although data are limited, non-hadrosaurid hadrosaurs also appear to have occipital skull roofs significantly narrower than the width behind the orbits; apart from Iguanodon and Tenontosaurus, this appears to be a general feature of Cretaceous iguanodontians. Other characters cited by Homer, such as the faint circumnarial fossa and the nonreflected beak attachment surface on the premaxilla , appear to be the result of changes in the formation ofthe circumnarial stmcture . coalescence of circumnarial fossae over intemarial bar; loss of invasion of premaxillary beak attachment surface by circumnarial fossa ; elongate, horizontal rostrodorsal process ofthe maxilla; dorsal ascending process of caudal process of jugal reduced ; prominently developed squamosal buttress on quadrate; pedal unguals with plantar \"keel\" as well as referred specimens shows that the nasals ofthe type, and indeed most ofthe skull, is slightly disarticulated. Proper articulation shows that the snout, while somewhat deep, is smoothly and shallowly tapered rostrally. The nasal is somewhat more curved than in ancestral taxa, but is in no way recurved as it is in Kritosaurus . A new restoration of Brachylophosaurus peeblesorum shows that the two species of Brachylophosaurus are very similar in overall head form , and are distinct from Kritosaurus. This restoration is confirmed by a new \"Maiasaura\" skull at the ROM, which was cmshed laterally rather than the dorsoventral cmshing ofthe type and the oblique cmshing of OTM F138. Even without such new information, the numerous derived characters listed above support the hypothesized close relationship between these two species, as originally argued by Homer . Homer has emphasized the \"primitive\" nature ofthe cranium of Maiasaura, without considering non-hadrosaurid hadrosaurs such as Bactrosaurus johnsoni, and Gilmoreosaurus mongoliensis. This assertion is based on the Iguanodonlike rostrum interpreted for the type specimen, as well as confiision surrounding the crest and circumnarial fossa. Trexler insists that there is no \"nasal crest\" on Brachylophosaurus peeblesorum. Yet, the nasals clearly participate in the \"interorbital crest\" of this species, and the latter does clearly constitute a departure from the skull profile. That it does not closely resemble the crests of some other hadrosaurids is consistent with the hypothesis that these crests were instrumental in premating isolation ofthe various hadrosaurid species . Homer , as well as Trexler , has interpreted the circumnarial fossa as being present only in close proximity to the margin ofthe narial foramen in Weishampel et al, 1993) , although the definition applied here precludes this synonymy operationally. antitrochanter is much more prominent. Occurrence. Brown , has often been used in connection with an hypothesized clade of \"solid-crested\" hadrosaurs, generally including Saurolophus, \"Prosaurolophus,\" \"Tsintaosaurus,\" and sometimes Lophorothon {e.g., Young 1958 , Ostrom 1961 . The former two are here considered synonymous, while the latter are a lambeosaurine and a non-hadrosaur, respectively. There is substantial support for a Saurolophus + Edmontosaurus group among hadrosaurs, {e.g., Weishampel and Homer, 1990; Weishampel et al, 1993; Diagnosis. -At this time, this taxon cannot be diagnosed by autapomorphies. The prepubic process ofthe pubis is very similar in outline to that of Saurolophus spp. Occurrence.-Naashoibito member, Kirtland Shale, New Mexico Age.-Late Maastrichtian Discussion. -Lucas and Hunt described a hadrosaur postcranium from the Naashoibito Member ofthe Kirtland Shale as a lambeosaurine. Williamson assigned this specimen to Hadrosaurinae {sensu lato). The pubis appears to have a welldefined acetabular emargination, although the cranial limit of extension of that emargination onto the iliac peduncle cannot be determined due to breakage. The preserved portion ofthe prepubic blade appears to be identical to that of Saurolophus , which suggests that this animal may be a late surviving member of that genus. AMNH 5795 from the Naashoibito Member ofthe Kirtland Shale includes a maxilla that appears to have a caudally set dorsal process, which would support such an assignment. However, this specimen requires closer examination. offered in support of this species, the greater rostro-caudal length ofthe nasal crest in \"P. ", "meta": {"ref_id": "Wagner"}}
{"text": "blackfeetensis appears to be due partially to cmshing ofthe type skull, in which the prefrontal has been displaced ventral to the skull roof, which in tum has been rotated dorsally and laterally, accentuating the juvenile frontal dome and appearing to elongate the crest. Isolated nasals from adults show that the caudal margin ofthe crest was abmpt, and the rostro-ventral length short in adult animals. The other character, lack of expression ofthe circumnarial fossa on the prefrontal, again appears to be the result of cmshing in the type, as is the apparent lack of a prefrontal ridge. The prefrontal is illustrated in its cmshed orientation, rather than in life position. In life it would have been inclined dorsolaterally, and the broad fossa visible on its dorsal surface in photographs would be continuous with the circumnarial fossa. Since only the prefrontal ofthe type is illustrated, it is impossible to determine the situation in an adult ofthe putative species. The lateral margin ofthe circumnarial fossa illustrated on adult nasals appear to show the exclusion ofthe prefrontal from the fossa. However, this ridge is very similar in morphology to that observed in Saurolophus maximus , and without a prefrontal there is no support for this character. Thus, \"Prosaurolophus \" blackfeetensis is not distinct, and is here considered a junior synonym of Saurolophus maximus. Discussion.-The included taxa may represent the same species, as they are tmly separated only by the shape ofthe crest, which varies with growth in S. angustirostris .

Occurrence.-Numerous units in Alberta, the northem Great Plains and Rocky Mountain states. New Mexico, Texas, Mexico, and the People's Republic of China. Discussion.-Lambeosaurines are often characterized as having \"robust\" humeri with deltopectoral crests broader than the humeral shaft and that extend a great distance down the humeral shaft {e.g., Brett-Surman, 1975; Weishampel and Homer, 1990 ). Specimens of Kritosaurus cf. K. navajovius from Big Bend show that such proportions hold for large individuals of that taxon, and this feature may characterize Saurolophinae as well. However, examination of illustrated specimens shows that the proportion ofthe length ofthe humeral shaft to the diameter across the distal condyles is less than 4 for Lambeosaurinae, and greater than 4 for all other hadrosaurs. This proportional difference appears to be consistent, and may constitute a better description ofthe \"robust\" humems of lambeosaurines. Occurrence. , and the foraminal pattem ofthe maxilla is similar to that in Lambeosaurus, in that the caudal foramena are tightly wrapped around the jugal articulation . The sagittal crest is indeed high, although it appears that cmshing has de-emphasized the prominence of this feature in specimens of Hypacrosaurus casuarius, Parasaurolophus walkeri and Lambeosaurus magnicristatus. The second observation was made by Dodson who, in supporting the validity of the latter species, noted that one ofthe two known specimens of this species hails from a location \"more than 100 miles south ofthe principle locality, from a locality which was more subject to marine influence [the latter observation is referenced to W.

However, TMM 43679, a particularly large hadrosaur fi-om the Javelina that unquestionably represents an adult, possesses this texture. Nasal.-Both nasals of TMM-42452-1 are preserved, although both show evidence of damage and plastic distortion. The right nasal is better preserved, showing only minimal distortion along its caudal margin, and slight displacement of the dorsal process. Although, the left bone was somewhat flattened beneath its opposite number and the jugal , and has lost much of its caudal and ventral edges, it preser\\es more ofthe dorsal process. From the two specimens, it is possible to describe the original shape ofthe bone with reasonable confidence. The nasal is at least 23 cm long along the medial suture, and 11.3 cm from the dorsal margin at the base ofthe dorsal process to the ventral edge below the premaxillary articulation. The bone is lamellar, and is 10.5 mm thick at its thickest point, the inflection point where the skull roof begins to rise to the nasal arch. A general thickness ofthe bone cannot be determined as the inner surface ofthe bone was not completely prepared. However, a thickness of less than 5 mm is estimated for most ofthe surface ofthe bone, thinning at the edges, and thickening substantially at the medial suture on the skull roof This would suggest that Hopson's interpretation ofthe crest in Kritosaurus as an agonistic weapon is probably incorrect . The bone may be divided into two parts, the body and the dorsal process. The body makes an obtuse triangle in lateral view, with the apex ofthe triangle oriented rostrodorsally. Between the rostroventral vertex ofthe triangle and the columnar dorsal process lies the caudal extremity ofthe narial foramen. From the relationship ofthe medial suture to the rest ofthe bone, the dorsal surface ofthe nasal was roughly horizontal in life, with the lateral surface facing laterally, and in the rostral half, somewhat rostrolaterally. At the rostroventral vertex ofthe body is a shallow, narrow fossa no more than 1.5 cm across which, in articulation, is lapped laterally by the premaxilla. Although the caudal margin ofthe fossa is damaged on the right maxilla and not preserved on the left, it is clear from the preserved articular surfaces that the premaxilla did not contact the prefrontal on the lateral surface ofthe skull. Ventral to the premaxillary articulation, along the ventrocaudal margin ofthe bone, is a thin, rugose, rounded edge where the bone may have contacted the maxilla as in Edmontosaurus . Caudally the ventrocaudal edge thins, presumably for its insertion into the dorsal articular slot ofthe lacrimal, a thin, arcuate flat surface dorsal to the edge marks the region where the latter bone laps the nasal. Halfway along this surface is the inflection which marks the transition from a rostrolateral to a lateral orientation ofthe nasal body. Although the edge is damaged here, a sutural area may be discerned. This area is a smooth, dorsally oriented trapezoidal surface for articulation of the prefrontal. This surface cuhninates in a narrow, rostrocaudally-oriented, sharplytapering oval facet which is somewhat produced from the surface ofthe bone. This facet lies flush with the dorsal surface, is continuous with the inflected edge between the dorsal and lateral faces ofthe nasal, and articulated with the rostrodorsal edge ofthe prefrontal. Although incomplete, the thickened caudal extremity ofthe nasal body, which forms the caudodorsal vertex ofthe triangle, appears to penetrate between the frontals as described by Homer . This part ofthe skull roof is flexed dorsally in both nasals, and somewhat laterally in the right bone. This flexure is considered to be the result of post mortem distortion as, in both bones, it draws the edge ofthe medial articular surface out ofthe parasagital plane. The dorsal midline suture is thickened, as noted above, and grows thicker to the base ofthe dorsal process. The nasal contribution to the skull roof is broad, approximately 5 cm from the prefrontal joint to the sagital midline, while the prefrontal articular surface appears to be only 4 cm long rostrocaudally, for a ratio of 1.25 . Although comparison is difficult, figures in Homer and Parks give the same ratio for Kritosaurus \"\"latidens \" as 0.50, with specimens attributed to K \"incurvimanus''^ scoring 0.59 and 0.65, and specimens ofK navajovius having ratios of 0.40 and 0.33. Although the latter species has wider nasals partially obscured by overlapping prefrontals , I estimate that a tmly comparable ratio for K. navajovius would still be only 0.67. Thus, K. sp. nov. has a shorter prefrontal facet, a wider nasal, or, as interpreted here, both. The bone thins laterally, less so toward the point where the dorsal and lateral, as well as lateral and rostrolateral, planes ofthe bone converge. This area forms a thickened, rounded comer which is extended rostrally and caudally as a sort of \"brow ridge\" along the skull was apparently interpreted as the edge ofthe circumnarial fossa by Homer [1992, see above] ).

The outer \"condylar\" ridge ofthe articulation is oriented with the flexor/ extensor plane, while the inner ridge is angled medially in the flexor direction. The extensor comer of this ridge is contiguous with the flange described previously, but the flexor comer tapers back into the flexor surface ofthe bone. The ridge marking the ancestral medial flexor edge ofthe shaft is separated from its lateral counterpart approximately one-third ofthe way distally down the shaft, and crosses medially almost to the medial extensor flange, then tapers into the shaft, disappearing completely. Where it begins to taper, it fits into the distal groove on the inner face of metacarpal II. For most of their length, the second and third metacarpal are separated. The medial comer ofthe head of metacarpal III fits into the previously mentioned shallow facet near the head of metacarpal II, resulting in a two-point articulation of these bones. The unusual form of metacarpal III requires that otherwise ordinary metacarpal II articulate along its flexor surface. Thus, distal articular surfaces of these bones are oriented at nearly forty-five degrees to one another, while the proximal heads form an angle of approximately sixty degrees.

As noted earher, the ancestral flexor edges ofthe shaft separate about one third of the way down the length ofthe bone; two-thirds ofthe way down this, the lateral ridge becomes promment, meets the \"condylar\" ridge distally, and, with its neomorphic medial counterpart, encloses a shallow fossa on the distal flexor face ofthe bone. The lateral surface of metacarpal III shows a longitudinal trough from the head along two-thirds of its length to the lateral flexor ridge. The swelling which forms the flexor margin of this trough articulates within a similar trough on metacarpal IV. This articulation is difficult to assess, but appears to involve the latter bone extending somewhat farther proximally and on the extensor face ofthe manus than metacarpal III. The bones are tightly appressed for two-thirds ofthe length ofthe latter, beyond which metacarpal IV diverges. Metacarpal IV is 22 centimeters long, and resembles an enlarged mirror-image of metacarpal II. Although metacarpal IV is more robust, it differs from the latter bone in so few features that a complete description is unwarranted. The proximal articular head of metacarpal IV is less rounded than that in II, and it is somewhat more mediolaterally compressed, relative to its length. However, the primary difference in the two bones is in the orientation ofthe distal articulation. The distal two-thirds ofthe shaft of metacarpal rV retains the ancestral square cross-section. The lateral flexor ridge is somewhat more prominent than in metacarpal II; it almost reaches the articular head, but disappears over a short distance one third ofthe length down the bone. Above the resulting flat area, the ridge is sharp and prominent for the ligamentous attachment of metacarpal V. The distal articulation is twisted medially toward metacarpal EI, but the end of the bone is divergent, as noted above. The form ofthe distal articulation is modified toward the state observed in the latter bone, with the development of a slight flange on the medial flexor comer ofthe shaft. The articulation is non-ginglymous, and appears almost squared-off; as with metacarpal E there is little indication of a preferred direction of movement. The metacarpal/ phalangeal joints ofthe inner three digits in this specimen, and indeed all hadrosaurids, suggests the development of plane joints. While this might reflect a tendency toward greater freedom of movement, it seems more likely that the first phalanges were bound together by ligaments. What movement was possible at this joint would have been guided the slightly ginglymous metacarpal IE/ phalanx El' joint. The non-ginglymous phalanx IIV11^ joint, which is aligned with the metacarpal/ first phalanx joints ofthe other digits, may have been more loosely bound. The functional unity ofthe hadrosaur manus is discussed briefly by Paul . Metacarpal V is substantially different from the others, being shorter at 9 centimeters, and stubbily proportioned. In keeping with the curving ofthe metacarpus around metacarpal IE, this bone articulates on the flexor portion ofthe lateral face of metacarpal IV, such that its head is just distal to that ofthe latter bone, and is divergent from that of metacarpal IV by approximately thirty degrees. A prominent trough on the inner side of metacarpal V accepts the ridge on metacarpal IV, and the distal articulation of metacarpal V is appressed to the smooth intermption in this ridge. Metacarpal V is somewhat curved, concave toward the extensor face ofthe manus. It appears very similar to metacarpal IV, albeit quite foreshortened. The proximal head is only weakly convex along its edges, and is pitted and slightly concave in the center. However, there is a slight raised lip which ascends the side of metacarpal IV in a shallow trough above the articular ridge on that bone. In cross-section, the articular face is kidney-shaped around the articular trough. The shaft sports striations extending from one to 1.5 centimeters down the shaft from the head similar to those on the other metacarpals. Metacarpal V is twisted nearly forty-five degrees along its stubby shaft to place the distal articulation in a strongly divergent orientation. The distal articulation is slightly cmshed, but remains divergent, orienting the digit outward . Phalanges.-Phalanges of TMM 42452-1 represent only the first two ranks, apart from the third phalanx of digit V. The absence ofthe distalmost phalanges suggests a distal-proximal disarticulation sequence, and thus decomposition in the presence of water . However, there appears to be a discrete tendon attachment on the flexor face of each penultimate phalanx in TMM 42452-1 . It is possible that the associated tendons kept all but the distal phalanges associated. The first rank of phalanges are all approximately seven to eight centimeters long, and are, at first glance remarkably similar. Phalanx II' has the classic \"dumbbell\" shape of manual phalanges, with slightly expanded proximal and distal ends. The body ofthe phalanx is compressed in the flexor-extensor direction, and strongly flattened on its flexor face. The distal articulation is somewhat offset outward relative to, but still parallel with, the proximal articulation, resulting in a skewed appearance in flexor and extensor view. The shaft has a compressed oval cross-section, with subtle ridges along the flexor edges; the inner edge is somewhat thinner, reflecting the fact that the bone is skewed away from this direction distally. The distal articular surface is rounded, and forms a compressed oval in cross section. It is somewhat ginglymous, in that a rounded surface with an extension onto the flexor face similar to those observed on better-developed phalangeal condyles is present on this outer half. The inner half is less well-defined, and is of smaller diameter, but is damaged, making these observations suspect. The articular surface extends well up onto the extensor surface ofthe phalanx, indicating the capacity for hyperextension. The proximal articular surface is shaped as a rounded ttapezoid, with the extensor side shortest. The articular surface faces slightly toward the extensor direction, also indicating hyperextendability. The lateral edges extend slightly farther proximally that the extensor and flexor edges, but the surface is by no means ginglymous. In articulation, the articular axes of both the proximal and distal joints is roughly thirty degrees divergent from the flexor-extensor plane of metacarpal E. In combination with the divergence evidenced by metacarpal II, the distal end of this digit must have diverged as much as ninety degrees from the axis of metacarpal IE. Phalanx IE is more dumbbell-shaped, and is less flattened on its extensor face. The proximal articulation is again trapezoidal and nearly flat, but with slightly raised lateral edges. The distal articular surface is well produced from the shaft, highly rounded, and has a saddle-shaped, ginglymous articular surface. The lateral condyle is larger and more rounded, resulting in a medially-directed digit in articulation. Phalanx IV' resembles II' somewhat. The phalanx has been deepened in the flexor-extensor direction, and flattened inward . The resuh is a triangular shaft, with a short, concave flexor surface and a short inner surface, opposed to a long, slightly convex surface representing the combined outer and extensor surfaces. The border between these first two surfaces forms a rounded medial flexor ridge between two longitudinal troughs on one side ofthe bone, and leads to one ofthe distal \"condyles.", "meta": {"ref_id": "Wagner"}}

{"text": "No \"hypsilophodonf teeth have been reported from any unit in the Big Bend region, and it seems likely that reports of possible hypsilophodont remains may refer to juvenile hadrosaur or adult pachycephalosaur material. The sauropod dinosaur Alamosaurus sanjuanensis is currently known only from the Javelina Formation and upper El Picacho Formation . While Alamosaurus has recently been labeled a form taxon by Sullivan and Lucas , form taxa are not employed under any nomenclatural code applicable to vertebrates. The characteristics of Alamosaurus sanjuanensis are well founded , and are being explored by Coulson and Lehman . It is perhaps significant that sauropod and hadrosaur fossils are never found in association in the Trans-Pecos Region . Much ofthe remaining vertebrate fauna of Trans-Pecos Texas consists of pterosaurs, crocodilians, chelonians, and fish, and the pterosaur Quetzalcoatlus northropi, along with a smaller, unnamed species ofthe same genus are known from the Javelina Formation . At least four crocodilian taxa are present in the section, including Deinosuchus riograndensis from the McKinney Springs tongue ofthe Pen Formation, the Terlingua Creek Sandstone, and the upper shale member ofthe Aguja Formation, Goniopholis cf. G. kirtlandicus from the lower and upper shale members and the Javelina Formation, and two other taxa known only from teeth . A great variety of chelonian taxa, most not identifiable below the generic level, are present in Big Bend . Amiid and lepisosteid fish are found throughout the section . Articulated, or even associated, hadrosaur material is rare in Big Bend National Park. This may indicate a bias in collecting, especially as most prospecting has been conducted in the eastem part ofthe Park, where exposures are largely confined to the lowermost upper shale member. It is possible that articulated specimens will eventually be recovered from higher in the section, in coastal or inland floodplain facies, representing environments where rapid burial may have been more likely. Lehman's general observations about the disarticulation sequence of ceratopsians appear to hold for hadrosaurs as well. Lehman points out that the representation of ceratopsian skeletal elements at sites in the Aguja Formation is consistent with a disarticulation sequence from distal to proximal, as is commonly observed in the disarticulation of corpses in the presence of water . This interpretation is consistent with the taphonomic scenarios presented below. Several hadrosaur specimens from Big Bend show what appears to be unusually complete preservation ofthe pes or both the pes and manus. This would generally be interpreted as indicating subaerial disarticulation . It should be remembered, however, that none of these specimens were actually discovered in a state of physical articulation. With the exception of some theropods most dinosaurs retain discrete, but often tightly appressed, metatarsi. This may be associated with the need for shock absorption in these generally large animals. Even among some theropods with tightly appressed metatarsals, pedal kinesis has been hypothesized in connection with shock absorption .These loose articulations may then be associated with extensive syndysmotic joints and a network ligamentous tissue tightly binding the metatarsus. In hadrosaurs, the metatarsus and metacarpus are tightly appressed, probably ligament-bound stmctures, and it is possible that the ligaments retarded the progress of disarticulation. The manus and pes may then have separated from the antebrachium or epipodium, respectively, as part ofthe ordinary disarticulation sequence, but at a stage of disarticulation well prior to that at which the manus or pes itself completely dissociated. These skeletal units would then have behaved as independent elements. Being somewhat larger than their component elements, they would have exhibited different hydraulic characteristics . They may have been transported less easily, increasing the potential for their representation with the large and more steadfast portions ofthe skeleton. At localities where the metatarsus is represented , most, if not all ofthe metatarsals are present, along with a substantial portion ofthe pedal phalanges. Often, many manual elements are also present ; TMM 42452, interpreted here as a heavily current winnowed specimen, preserves all but the distalmost phalanges ofthe manus. When discussing transport of elements, it is important to keep in mind the transient nature of transported bone. The presence of easily transported elements at a site may indicate that the assemblage is largely intact, however, it may also indicate an assemblage made up wholly or in large part of transported bone. Assemblages ofthe former type will have a high proportion of elements resistant to transport, relative to the latter type. Lehman proposed that the comparison ofthe number of vertebrae and ribs in a ceratopsian or hadrosaur deposit might be compared with the number of other elements to assess the degree of transport ofthe specimen. In the case of hadrosaurs, it seems clear that this measure must be modified, as hadrosaur skull bones appear to be very easily transported. In Figure 20 , they are included along with vertebrae and ribs. One caveat for this application of Lehman's method is that it was originally based on the assumption that there are approximately the same number of vertebrae and ribs as other elements in the skeleton ofthe animals considered . Unlike ceratopsians, hadrosaurs have a considerable caudal skeleton; the proportion is approximately 60% as calculated by Lehman. As calculated above, the proportion of ribs and vertebrae to remaming skeletal elements in hadrosaurs is closer to 70%. However, the resulting index illustrates relationships similar to those proposed here, suggesting that it may nonetheless be a useful statistic. The baseline for comparison should be ahered to around a 70% vertebrae and rib fraction for hadrosaurs, as show n in Figure 20 . As shown by Lehman , Voorhies' have pointed out that the effect of incomplete disarticulation on the representation of faunal elements cannot be stressed sufficiently. The hadrosaur metacarpus and metatarsus appear to be preserved more readily than would otherwise be indicated. Caudal vertebrae appear to be more resistant to transport than other vertebrae due to their size. Additionally, in life they were bound by a lattice of ossified tendons, which appears to favor disarticulation into segments of several vertebrae , and probably increased their resistance to transport. In many Alberta hadrosaurs, the tail is incompletely known, presumably because of progressive loss of distal elements . This may be a strong indication of locally differing taphonomic regimes. The head, neck and cranial dorsal vertebrae, which were not held together by ossified tendons, disarticulated early in decomposition , allowing these elements to be winnowed rapidly. The hadrosaur neck was supported by strong nuchal ligaments, probably connecting altemate vertebrae, as in birds , and not was connected to the \"withers\" as reconstmcted by Paul after the pattem in ungulates. Evidence for such powerful ligaments is present in the extreme recurvature ofthe neck in articulated hadrosaur skeletons, which curvature appears to sometimes extend onto the dorsum and distort the ventral flexure ofthe back . The neck may have indeed been swan-like and only weakly muscled {contra Czerkas, 1993) , as it is commonly restored, which would have greatly contributed to its easy disarticulation. Although not common, skulls of hadrosaurs are sometimes encountered in near isolation {e.g., TMM 41442-1; Head, 1998; Sternberg, 1953) . This indicates that the skull sometimes remained articulated as a unit during transport. Such sites usually yield a small quantity of bone from representation group II . Presumably, a whole skull, at least a non-lambeosaurine skull, would belong to that representation group. Lehman observed that the ceratopsian cranium apparently exhibited taphonomic behavior different from that of mammal skulls, in that it commonly disarticulated prior to burial. Thus, the skull was not transported as a single unit, as in mammals. This is also tme of hadrosaurs, which lacked the large, tightly integrated cranial elements of ceratopsians. The preponderance of articulated hadrosaur skulls in the famous latest Cretaceous hadrosaur-bearing strata of northem North America appears to be an artifact of special preservation, and is not characteristic of other regions. Table 1 also presents a tabulation of representation groups ofhadrosaur cranial elements, which are numbered so as to be approximately equivalent to the representation groups for postcrania. Outside of Big Bend, the hadrosaur dentary is the most commonly encountered skull bone, while within the region, the maxilla predominates. It is possible that collection bias may account for part of this, as cranial bones are considered more diagnostic. However, the common occurrence of maxillae may have more to do with the combined robustness and ease of transport ofthe maxilla. Significantly, maxillae are often encountered in deposits containing a high percentage of transported material {e.g., levee-type and some tidal creek-type settings). The maxilla may simply be closer in hydrodynamic characteristics to elements likely to attract the attention of collectors. Localities are here described by \"study area\" , these names being applied informally for the purpose of this study. Detailed information is on file at the .-21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 106 Discussion.-This locality presents a variation on the typical tidal creek deposits ofthe upper shale member. The specimen is intimately associated with inclined, rhythmic interbeds of siltstone and hgnite. The disarticulated, slightly winnowed, and apparently current-aligned nature ofthe specimen suggests that it was deposited on the streambed, and subsequently covered by point bar deposits. The association of small oysters with the site probably attests to the presence of brackish conditions, and the rhythmic lithological heterogeneity ofthe channel deposits argue for a paralic, tidally influenced setting. The grain size difference between the channel deposits and the surrounding mudstones suggests a stream carrying a substantial sediment load derived from outside the coastal marsh and swamp belt environment. This does not appear uncommon in the lower shale member at the Rattlesnake Mountain study area, and may suggest that many of these were true coastal streams draining small but relatively extensive areas ofthe coastal plain rather than just interdistributary marshes. This deposit represents a single burial, with the preserved elements somewhat channelized along an approximate east-west axis, and preserves many easily winnowed elements. The left manus, parts of at least one pes, and parts ofthe skull and cervical series were preserved along with parts ofthe pelvis, while the remaining elements of representation groups I and II were winnowed away by current action. The complete absence of representation group III suggests that the preserved portions ofthe skeleton had already moved some ways down stream from where the body first entered the water. It is possible, however, that these elements were present at the site but were concealed beneath the overburden, and were simply not found. The manus and part ofthe skull of this specimen were partially encmsted with iron oxide cements . These element groups were somewhat disarticulated, indicating that they may have been loosely bound by rotting flesh. Carbonized plant debris, abundant in the surrounding sediments, was found in the core of both groups. -26, 27, 28, 29, 104 Discussion.-This site is also a typical levee microvertebrate site. Abundant material from this site may represent a new species of turtle . The hadrosaur maxilla from this site is much larger than the other material at the site, approached in size only by some pieces of turtle. Especially unusual is the preservation of the medial wall ofthe alveolar chamber, and pieces of a number of teeth were also recovered. This suggests that the maxilla was transported intact, with the teeth in place; this must have been a rather dense sedimentary particle. As with site TMM 42534, the presence of a maxilla indicates the possibility of substantial flow velocities during initial -15, 31, 32, 33, 107 Discussion.-The bones were recovered from a dark grey mudstone at the base of a chaotically-bedded very fine sandstone layer containing reworked concretions, carbonaceous plant fragments, the bones listed here, and shell fragments . The upper and lower contacts ofthe sandstone unit are undulose, and the unit appears to represent part of an inclined, heterolithic set. A previously unidentified form of bivalve shell was recovered from above the level ofthe sandstone bed in a very finegrained sandstone unit. While the maxilla, a rib, and the theropod tooth were recovered from just below the sandstone, the chevron and vertebrae were found in the sandstone along with another rib fragment and the crocodilian tooth . Although the possibility of a substantial time lag between the deposition of these elements cannot be discounted, it seems reasonable to assume that all ofthe hadrosaur elements belong to the same animal, and the bones and sandstone may represent parts ofthe same depositional event. It is likely that the animal's remains were worked into a stream channel, and subsequent flooding resulted in entombment within, or just below, the sandstone. All ofthe elements present are believed to be easily transported , and are all roughly cylindrical, and thus probably exhibited similar hydrodynamic behavior . This suggests that the assemblage was transported. An hypothetical sequence of events might begin with the death ofthe animal within the stream, or close enough to be worked into it without calling on floodwaters as the agent of initial transport. The body disarticulated in place during a period of low flow stage in the stream. The next flood stage transported much ofthe skeleton downstream, depositing skeletal elements along with its sediment load as the stream lost energy. Between flood stages, the stream retiuned to a low-energy environment, and was recolonized by a faima including bivalves and other burrowmg animals, which turbated the sandstone substrate and would ultimately contribute their skeletal elements to the sediment load ofthe next flood pulse. This deposit is therefore interpreted to represent channel deposit, although perhaps not directly comparable to deposits recognized as such in other areas . The ephemeral nature of high energy flow hypothesized here would allow for the more ready preservation of bone, and the significant accumulation of mud-sized sediment between flood stages might shield bones from reentrainment and the destructive consequences of continual transport . Cycles of flood-stage reactivation of generally quiet waters such as those hypothesized here fall within the category of channel fill deposits presented by Behrensmeyer . She notes that standing water in inactive channels may support stands of vegetation, and may attract animals {ibid. p. 193), similar to the situation hypothesized above for stream channels. Lehman 1982 , Davies 1983 Lithostratigraphy.-upper shale member, Aguja Formation Hadrosaur specimens.-\"WPA 3 individual\" of Davies Figure 2 and Plate 1 of Lehman Discussion.-The WPA quarries are discussed in detail by Lehman and Davies . All ofthe hadrosaur bones from the WPA 3 quarry are quite large, and there is only one case of duplication of elements . The matching pedes, hindlimb elements, and the presence of two ilia and two ischia lead Davies to suggest that all but one ofthe bones from the WPA 3 locality represent a single individual. Davies' mensural comparison of this specimen to Kritosaurus notabilis {= K incurvimanus), met with results that fell within 10% of each other for the long-bones ofthe hindlimb and the ischium. Qualitatively, this value is a more than acceptable, as the specimen used for comparison is much smaller , and, in most dinosaurs, hindlimb proportions change with growth {e.g., Holtz 1994 ). Study Area.-Talley Mountain Site Number.-\"WPA 3\" of While the ilium and ischia are roughly the same size, detailed comparison suggests that they are not in the proportions that would be expected if they belonged to the same animal, a conclusion also evident from Davies' data. It is worth noting that the ilium is incomplete. However, authors {ibid, and this study) are not in agreement regarding the amount of length missing , although any reasonable amount is not likely to constitute much of a difference. Assuming that the lengths recorded by Lull and Wright are all entirely incompatible, resulting in an almost 5% error in ischiadic length, and that Davies' reconstmction is correct, the ischium falls within one standard deviation ofthe mean. The only evidence linking ilium P.37.7.222 to the remaining bones from the WPA 3 locality is its large size and association with single or paired elements from the rear half of a large hadrosaur. Physical attempts to fit ischium UTEP P.37.7.220 to ilium UTEP P.37.7.222 proved equivocal; it is possible that the bones do not fit properly, although the size ofthe elements, their state of preservation, and the possibility of a cartilaginous pad at the joint prevent a definitive statement on the matter. Davies' own calculations show the ilium to be much shorter than expected for an up-scaled Kritosaurus notabilis , as well as much wider. Also, these comparisons were made with a specimen that appears to have a short ilium relative to other specimens of Kritosaurus. Davies suggests that a quarry photograph {ibid., Plate I.l, Figure 36 of this study) may indicate that ilium UTEP P.37.7.222 was found closely associated with another ilium , and possibly the ischia recovered at the site. However, this photo shows WPA workers standing on the quarry floor, \"preparing [the bones] for plastering,\" according to the quoted caption. The arrangement ofthe bones suggests that they had been recognized as similar elements, but little can be said about morphological similarities, since no details can be made out. There is no compelling ev idence to associate ihum UTEP P.37.7.222 widi the remainder ofthe postcrania. Given the preservation of ossified ligaments, and possible ligamentous binding of these elements during transport, it is interesting that neither the sacrum, to which hadrosaur iha are tightly bound, nor any ofthe caudal dorsal vertebrae, to which the ilia are attached by ossified ligaments are found in the WPA 3 collection. One would expect a sacrum freed from its ilia to have hydrodynamic properties similar to the linked caudal vertebrae found at the site . Ilia themselves would have peculiar hydrodynamic properties, presumably much different from the remaining elements in the assemblage, which are all less plate-like. TMM 42309 contains two left ilia of nearly the same size, as well as three ischia, caudal vertebrae, haemal arches, and a rib. The WPA 3 quarry may contain pelvic material from two or more similarly sized hadrosaurs, but vertebral material from only one of them The remaining postcrania are more robust than isometrically scaled elements of A^. ''incurvimanus,\" which is not surprising given the size difference in the specimens compared. There appears to be no reason to dispute their association, and this is tentatively accepted. This assessment is also supported by information on the Works Progress Administration excavations themselves. Quarrying at site WPAl was abandoned when the excavation reached a point where the overburden was too deep to continue, and WPA2 was closed when bone ceased to be found, but WPA3 was abandoned when the project was terminated . The collection from WPA 3 then does not necessarily represent the complete deposit, and the hypothesis that nearly all ofthe material corresponds to a single animal relies on negative evidence, the absence of extensive material from another animal. -25, 39, 40, 41, 42 Discussion.-The presence of thick concretionary coverings on nearly all bones greatly complicates identifications. Table 3 represents a best approximation ofthe recovered elements from this site. The table is somewhat misleading, in that some elements are represented only by fragments, and some numbers are minima based on a number of fragmentary specimens. Since collection was concentrated in the area from which the maxillae were recovered, the site was unevenly sampled. Elements ofthe smaller hadrosaur were undoubtedly left uncollected. This sample appears to consist of less transportable elements, mostly of representation group II or III . It appears that the assemblage has been winnowed by current action, but not extensively. Unfortunately, the heavily damaged and encmsted nature ofthe specimens makes them nearly useless for serious systematic work. Mosaic fracturing, often infilled with concretionary matrix, splintery fracture with the grain ofthe bone, and minor abrasion mostly comparable to Stage 1 of Behrensmeyer all suggest that this material was exposed at the surface for some time prior to burial. Although several bones exhibit more severe weathering, this is not unexpected . The presence of highly weathered, rounded and smoother \"bone pebbles\" indicates some long-lived \"background\" bone . However, most ofthe elements present show a roughly comparable degree of preburial weathering. Recent weathering is evident on most specimens, and is easily distinguished by the separation of blocky fragments perpendicular to the grain ofthe bone , often resulting in the complete removal of all cortical bone on the specimen. These cracks often penetrate the surrounding diagenetic concretion. Bones ofthe smaller hadrosaur exhibit a ropey or \"woven\" texture similar to that described by Behrensmeyer as \"type 3\" weathering. However, the areas which show this are mostly around the neural arches of vertebrae. Hadrosaur neural arches observed at this locality and others {e.g., TMM 41442) characteristically show a \"woven\", remodeled texture. It seems likely that the thin cortical bone ofthe specimens was completely removed as the concretionary coating spalled off, a commonly observed phenomenon at the site, resulting in the exposure ofthe tme bone texture below. This site, then, appears to represent two single burials of hadrosaurs, a large adult and a juvenile, which may or may not have died together. The other remains in the assemblage appear to constitute background and sparse transported elements. 40, 43, 44, 45 Discussion.-If the excavation pit at this site is correctly identified, the specimen was recovered from tan clay just below a channel deposit. Some extraneous bone fragments were located at the site, and appear to confirm that the pit was indeed fossiliferous at one point. Since Brown's notes were not consulted, and the specimen has not yet been examined, little more can be said. It is possible that this site represents a levee deposit, although it would be one ofthe lowest, stratigraphically. Discussion.- Davies presented stratigraphic columns of this locality . Although he suggested that the two columns were at different heights in the section, in this area very little ofthe Aguja Formation is exposed above the Terlingua Creek Sandstone Member. It seems most likely that this site is in the Terlingua Creek Sandstone itself, or just above it. This site contains only elements considered \"highly transportable\" , and is almost certainly a transported assemblage. It is not surprising that it contains the remains ofthe pelvis and tail of two very similarly sized hadrosaurs; the represented elements probably had very similar hydrodynamic properties has described the rare, hadrosaur bearing facies ofthe Javelina Formation as being \"Aguja-like.\" ", "meta": {"ref_id": "Wagner"}}

{"text": "Indeed, this situation bears witness to the inherent lack of meaning in Linnaean ranks, as the same set of species, with the same hypothesized exclusive relationships, may be accommodated at three separate supraspecific ranks . Note that I am uncertain regarding the ancestral shape ofthe hadrosaur dentary. Although the rostral end is deflected ventrally in most non-hadrosaurid hadrosaurs, this may or may not be homologous with the deep ventral flexure ofthe mandibular ramus in Hadrosaurinae {sensu stricto) and Lambeosaurinae, or even whether these latter two conditions are homologous. The phylogenetic hypothesis accepted here . Is equivocal on the matter: the flexed condition in these two groups might be homologous and symplesiomorphic for the group, with the situation in Brachylophosaurus considered a convergent with that in Saurolophinae, or they may be convergent, with the condition in Brachylophosaurus and Saurolophinae being symplesiomorphic. HADROSA URINAE Lambe 1918 Definition. However, the preserved material is very similar to that of Kritosaurus, a fact alluded to by several authors . This association is fiirther supported here, allowing the referral of Kritosaurus to Hadrosaurinae. Although all so-called \"flat-headed\" hadrosaurids were suspicious of all but the type species of Hadrosaurus, although they believed that the species was valid. Hadrosaurus foulkii was distinguished from Edmontosaurus annectens by those authors using four characters: the craniocaudally short proximal caudal vertebrae, the more pronounced rake of the middorsal neural spines, the morphology ofthe teeth, and the distinctive ilium of Hadrosaurus foulkii. Examination of illustrations ofthe vertebrae of Hadrosaurus foulkii reveals their strongly opisthocoelous nature, which suggests that they are, in fact, cranial dorsals. Such a degree of angulation is often observed in hadrosaur cranial dorsal centra. As discussed below, the length of proximal caudal centra appears to vary with position, from long at the proximal and distal extrema to short near the base ofthe tail. Proportions of these vertebrae have not been analyzed systematically, but there does not appear to be any evidence to support this distinction. The difference in dental morphology appears to stem from the apomorphically short tooth crowns of Edmontosaurus annectens. Hadrosaurus can not be supported, as papillation is variable throughout the toothrow of hadrosaurids . The teeth are short , relative to non-Kritosaurus hadrosaurs other than Edmontosaurus annectens . The pelvis of Hadrosaurus foulkii is certainly different than that of Edmontosaurus. In these cases, the morphology observed in Hadrosaurus foulkii is ancestral, and of little use in referring the species. Baird and Homer synonymized Hadrosaurus with Kritosaurus, a change widely acknowledged and adopted, and one which has influenced reconstmctions and popular accounts ever since. These authors gave no evidence for this referral, and, in abstract form, the proposed synonymy was hardly a compelling nomenclatural act. This view has been subsequently abandoned by most authors, generally without comment. Davies set out to graphically demonstrate that Kritosaurus and Hadrosaurus were not synonymous by comparing elements ofthe type ofthe latter genus using illustrations of ROM 4514 and MCSNM v345 {K. notabilis [Pinna, 1979] ). Although Davies suggests, quite reasonably, that the similar size ofthe first two specimens should make comparison quite reasonable, he does not account for the possibility that different growth rates in different species, and possibly even different individuals, might cause individuals ofthe same size to reflect proportions associated with later ontogenetic stages in others. In this regard, Davies' comparisons ofthe caudal vertebrae of these two genera are unconvincing. Since the angulation ofthe caudal neural spine varies through the series, it is likely that the vertebrae he compared were from different parts ofthe tail. This is confirmed by the craniocaudally thicker neural spines ofthe Kritosaurus vertebrae, which are indicative of proximal caudals. Davies notes that the Hadrosaurus vertebrae have a traverse process, yet one ofthe more shallowly inclined Kritosaurus vertebrae does not, implying it is from more distal in the column. However, ofthe four proximal caudals illustrated by Pinna , Davies chose the two with the least inclined neural spines. The twelfth and sixteenth caudals show much more pronounced caudal rakes which compare well with the representative vertebra of Hadrosaurus foulkii . Additionally, the \"rake\" ofthe neural spines on hadrosaur caudal vertebrae changes throughout the column, being steepest distally, but also most proximally, and approximately one-third ofthe distance along the tail at the \"transition point\" . Davies ' comparison of femora shows small differences in the shapes ofthe proximal and distal ends, the head, and the fourth trochanter. However, the head ofthe femur of ROM 4514 was reconstmcted by Parks , and the proximal and distal ends ofthe femur of Hadrosaurus foulkii appear to be abraded, especially the greater trochanter. Overall the correspondence of these bones is good, and the differences can reasonably be attributed to individual variation. The same is almost certainly tme ofthe humems, as the difference noted by Carpenter is quite modest. Indeed, the difference in that bone is so slight as to be almost imperceptible in cranial view, and, were one not told the outlines of Davies were of different bones, one might readily believe they were the same bone viewed from slightly different angles. Davies' comparison ofthe metatarsals of these animals is complicated by the fact that he compares metatarsal III of Kritosaurus notabilis with an isolated metatarsal IV attributed to Hadrosaurus foulkii . The latter bone agrees well with metatarsal IV of Kritosaurus. However, Davies has pointed out, and Hunt and Lucas echoed, that the pelvis of Hadrosaurus foulkii is different in outline from that of ROM 4514. This observation is comphcated by a number of factors. Parks' drawing ofthe latter bone does not match his photograph, being too thick and elliptical rostrally, too broad caudally, the iliac peduncle being too short. The photo matches TMM 42309-2, AMNH 8053 and other ilia referable to Kritosaurus very well, although it still shows subtle differences in the outline ofthe dorsal margin, and the short preacetabular process. Both of these may be the result of postmortem deformation and breakage, respectively. In any case, restoration ofthe ilium of Hadrosaurus foulkii is also somewhat suspect. From illustrations and photos, the dorsal margin appears cmshed, obscuring the development ofthe overhanging rim and bending the antitrochanter dorsally. Although heavily restored, the base ofthe preacetabular process appears to have been flattened somewhat, exaggerating differences relative to Kritosaurus in the shape of the embayment dorsal to the pubic peduncle. While the dorsal margin ofthe caudal process is angled dorsally as in Kritosaurus and non-hadrosaurids, fragments ofthe ventral margin have been reassembled to form a strange shape which more closely resembles the more horizontal postacetabular process of non-Kritosaurus hadrosaurids. From illustrations , this reconstmction appears dubious. Further, it creates a ventral inflection or pendant ventral knob unknown in other hadrosaurs. Waterhouse Hawkins' cast reconstmction of Hadrosaurus foulkii shows a smooth ventral margin , suggesting that he too lacked confidence in this aspect of Leidy's reconstmction . Davies asserts that the differences in the ilium that separate Hadrosaurus foulkii and Kritosaurus spp. are as great as those which separate the latter species from Saurolophus. It seems clear that, from the perspective of discrete characters, the greatest apparent difference among these bones is 132 found among the ilia Davies {ibid.) referred to Kritosaurus sp. . On the other hand, many ofthe differences between the ilia of Kritosaurus notabilis, Saurolophus maximus and S. osborni are the result of reconstmction in the latter . Ilia ANSP 10005 and TMM 42309-2 appear more similar to each other than either they do to any other hadrosaur ilium. That their lateral outlines differ, especially in the possibly greater dorsal inflection ofthe postacetabular process in the latter, is cause for caution. In light ofthe deformity and ambiguity ofthe type of Hadrosaurus foulkii, and , which does not recognize obhgatory taxa, the will not apply to genera and species at first, a genus name must be selected. It seems best to retain Hadrosaurus as valid and nomenclaturally distinct from Kritosaurus until the type species is better known. It seems appropriate, additionally, to restrict this genus to the type species until another species can be demonstrated to be more closely related to it than to another species. Should Hadrosaurus foulkii be found to be part of a clade with some species of Kritosaurus and not others, the data may then be sufficient to confirm the validity of Hadrosaums. An isolated quadrate from the Homerstown Formation, referred to cf Edmontosaurus postorbital-premaxillary contact reduced to a point or absent; very thin jugal process of the postorbital with no development of a postorbital \"pocket;\" skull roof rises slopes dorsocaudally in adults; skull at quadrates laterally almost as wide or as wide as skull across postorbitals; infratemporal fenestra especially broad in adults ; preacetabular process of ilium long, extending well ventral to the plane of iliac peduncles; acetabular margin of pubis very weakly defined . Occurrence. Hopson, 1975) , it has received little detailed attention beyond the excellent monographs of Parks and Pinna , and the unpublished work of Davies . Gryposaurus was synonymized with Kritosaurus by authors ahnost immediately upon its pubhcation , and that synonymy was accepted for many years. Recentiy, Homer separated the two taxa on the assertion that Kritosaurus navajovius lay phylogenetically closer to Saurolophus osborni within the widely recognized {e.g., Weishampel and Homer, 1990; Weishampel et al, 1993; Homer, 1992) Edmontosaurus-Saurolophus clade . Indeed, Homer postulated that Kritosaurus lay closer to Saurolophus osborni than to \"Prosaurolophus\"\" maximus on the shared possession of a crest which extends caudally over the frontals, nasals which penetrate between the frontals on the midline ofthe skull roof, and broad medial overlap ofthe prefrontals onto the nasals. However, ilia referable to Kritosaurus navajovius retain the dorsally inflected postacetabular process which is lost in saurolophines, and one exhibits the dorsoventrally narrow preacetabular blade of the ilium characteristic of \"Gryposaurus.", "meta": {"ref_id": "Wagner"}}

All these features are synapomorphic for Saurolophinae. The postcranium of Kritosaurus navajovius, although poorly known, lacks the apomorphically reduced dorsal neural spines of saurolophines . Kritosaurus also does not exhibit \"coalescence\" ofthe circumnarial fossae over the intemarial bar, a slitlike narial foramen, a slightly reduced buccal cavity caused by a lateral bulge on the dentary in front ofthe coronoid process, and eversion ofthe prefrontal margin as a ridge lateral to the circumnarial fossa, all of which are characteristic of Saurolophus {sensu lato). Another character mentioned by Homer have resulted in the noted \"w\"-shaped suture . This is supported by the fact that the nasofrontal suture in K. notabilis is in a position rostral to that in K navajovius . The overlap ofthe nasals by the prefrontals may be a common stmctural adaptation to support the crest, explaining its convergent development in high-crested species of Saurolophus and Kritosaurus. Kritosaurus and Gryposaurus as synonyms is a matter of nomenclatural/za^ There has never been an objective basis for genus-level separation of members of an exclusive group. Given the historically recognized synonymy of these genera, the general disutility of monospecific genera, and the \"lumping\" predilections ofthe author, synonymy is here retained for Kritosaurus and Gryposaurus. Note that species of Kritosaurus are presented out ofthe conventional order here to preserve the phylogenetically hierarchical format ofthe text. Kritosaurus latidens Synonymy.-Gryposaurus latidens Revised Diagnosis.-Extensive premaxillary palate with a socket ventrally for the rostrodorsal process ofthe maxilla; mandibular teeth very broad . Age.-Early Campanian Discussion.-\"Gryposaurus\" latidens was recognized by Homer based on remains of an animal very similar to Kritosaurus notabilis, but with a more \"robust\" humems, wider dentary teeth, some mesial examples of which have \"split\" median carinae, and a socket in the premaxilla for the rostrodorsal process ofthe maxilla. He ftirther suggested {ibid.) that, since some of these features were \"primitive\" for hadrosaurines {sensu Homer 1988 Homer , 1990 Homer , 1992 , this species was a \"metataxon\" lacking evidence of monophyly. The synthetic approach to species adopted here . As explained below, currently available evidence fails to support the claim that specimens referred to this species have an exceptionally elongate humems . The resemblance of tooth morphology of this species to that of earlier iguanodontians, such as Camptosaurus and Iguanodon {e.g., Norman 1990a), in the \"split\" carinae and wide enameled faces ofthe teeth appears to represent homoplasies, and not plesiomorphy. Consensus of phylogenetic hypotheses presented by all current workers places a number of taxa {e.g., Bactrosaurus johnsoni, Protohadros byrdi, Telmatosaurus transylvanicus) closer to hadrosaurids. All of these have narrower teeth and show progressive reduction of all but the median carina. This strongly indicates that this morphology constitutes an autapomorphic reversal . The divided carinae of Kritosaurus latidens may also be pathological, and as their relationship to secondary ridges is unproven . It seems best not to place too much emphasis upon them. Kritosaurus latidens is then characterized only by its wide teeth, which appear to be consistent among specimens , and the presence of articular sockets for the rostrodorsal process ofthe maxilla in the premaxillary palate. This latter state is indicative of a general elongation ofthe premaxillary palate , which extends caudodorsally, surrounding the rostrodorsal processes in articulation. As the maxilla is only illustrated in lateral view, it is not possible to determine whether there are corresponding modifications ofthe rostrodorsal process. The species is also characterized by plesiomorphies, including the rostral placement ofthe peak ofthe narial crest , and the consequently wide nasal contribution to the narial foramen. Homer's reconstmction ofthe skull of Kritosaurus latidens shows the premaxilla sitting well above the maxilla rather than lapping it laterally. This position provides almost no physical contact between the two bones. From the illustration provided , the premaxilla of AMNH 5465 appears distorted, and it seems most likely that the premaxilla lapped the maxilla laterally as in other species of Kritosaurus. This is home out by the illustration of a maxilla referred to this species , which appears to show a standard Kritosaurus articular surface for the premaxilla on the lateral face ofthe rostroventral process. \"incurvimanus \") . This feature may also be observed in photographs ofthe type of that species , and TMM 42314-1 from the Oldman Formation of Alberta , which is also referable to K notabilis . In contrast, the third maxillary foramen of Kritosaurus navajovius observation that these foramina are often cmshed closed or not prepared or illustrated, making evaluation of variation in their pattems somewhat problematic. It is also worth noting that foramen II in species of Saurolophus is enlarged, and is set in a fossa. In some illustrations it appears to be two foramina . This condition, however, appears to be distinct from that observed in Big Bend and San Juan Basin specimens, and the lack of similar morphology in Brachylophosaurus peeblesorum , Edmontosaurus regalis , and Lambeosaurinae suggests that this feature is convergent. In Kritosaurus latidens and K sp. nov. , the nasal arch extends broadly rostrally , encompassing a rostrocaudally broad narial foramen. In contrast, the nasal arch is \"laid\" caudally against the \"brow\" ofthe skull in adult \"male\" K. notabilis and especially K navajovius, in which this condition is present even in an apparently subadult, possibly female specimen . This difference is difficult to quantify, especially given the absence of complete specimens of either ofthe former two taxa. However, the easier transition from the more rostrally placed arch in K latidens and K. sp. nov. to the long ancestral, nearly straight nasals of forms such as Iguanodon bernissartensis , Bactrosaurus johnsoni , and Gilmoreosaurus mongoliensis suggests that this is the ancestral condition . On the other hand, Lophorothon atopus has a nasal crest set close to the \"brow\" ofthe skull , and a similar crest has been restored for a mounted reconstmction of Secemosaurus australis study remains a comerstone ofhadrosaur osteology, and has made the species a pivotal part of our understanding of hadrosaurs. It has previously been synonymized with K. navajovius by Brett-Surman and Hunt and Lucas , although, at the time, the latter species was very poorly known. Differences in the nasal arch, maxilla, and prepubic process ofthe pubis readily separate these species; sample size is too small to confirm other reported differences . Parks named Kritosaurus incurvimanus on the basis of ROM 4514, a superbly preserved skeleton, including a partial skull, from the Judith River Group of Alberta. Although this species has been widely accepted by many authors {e.g., Carrano et al, 1999; Homer, 1992; Lull and Wright, 1942; Pinna, 1979; Weishampel and Homer, 1990 ), others have suggested that it may represent a sexual dimorph ofK. notabilis. The primary features used by that Parks to distinguish this animal from Kritosaurus notabilis were the smaller size, lack ofthe orbital emargination Lambe observed in the type of Kritosaurus notabilis, a somewhat different shape ofthe orbit, greater separation of the jugal and quadrate below the infratemporal fenestra, the more rostral position ofthe narial crest , and the presence of several wedge-shaped manual phalanges. Parks also mentions the presence of a fourth manual phalanx in the context of differentiating the species from other genera, as the manus of Kritosaurus was otherwise unknown at the time. The absence ofthe \"emargination\" observed by Lambe in other specimens ofK. notabilis {e.g., Pinna, 1979; Weishampel and Homer, 1990) suggests that it represents little more than damage to the prefrontal bone dorsolateral to the lacrimal canal. The smaller size is easily attributed to the skeleton belonging to a younger animal, and the shape ofthe orbit may be due to this as well. Further, the distinctive \"knotted brow\" shape ofthe orbit in other Kritosaurus specimens is partially due to the abmpt inward flexure ofthe bones surrounding the orbital foramen immediately medial to the orbital fenestra itself Specimens in which this intemal emargination is not exposed due to incomplete preparation , or is obscured through distortion have much less \"stem\" countenance. Separation of the jugal and quadrate is a feature which is variable with the state of preservation of a specimen, and therefore of dubious systematic value. Examination of the jugal and quadratojugal of TMM 42452-1, and the quadrate of TMM 41442-1, suggests that the quadratojugal and quadrate were bound together in life by soft tissues, while the jugal and quadratojugal most likely met at a sliding lap joint. This scheme is opposite that advocated by Weishampel , but constitutes a better explanation for the stmcture ofthe relevant joints, and for the observed variability in the positions of these bones. The presence of a more rostrally placed nasal crest, inferred by Parks from the lack of a preserved crest in his skull, is confirmed by RTMP 80.22.1 , a small specimen which is presently undescribed. This specimen shows that Park's reconstmction was too long in the snout, and the crest of this morphotype, rather than being simply more rostrally placed, is extremely reduced. RTMP 80.22.1 shows only a very subtle dorsoventral thickening ofthe intemarial bar that barely rises above the plane ofthe skull roof . The characters ofthe manus listed by Parks are discussed elsewhere . They are not at all anomalous, and do not justify the erection of a new species. Of other differences among the named species of Kritosaurus listed by Davies , none appears to be significant. However, Homer points out two additional differences in justifying the separation of \"Gryposaurus latidens\" and \"Gryposaurus incurvimanus'' from Kritosaurus navajovius.

{"text": "Indeed, the observation ofthe \"light\" and shallow\" nature of the jugal in Brachylophosaurus may be extended with little reservation to Kritosaurus . That the maxillary process of the jugal in Brachylophosaurus is in the form of an isosceles triangle is symplesiomorphic; the elongate form ofthe triangle is seen in some Kritosaurus. It is possible that the form ofthe maxillary articulation of the jugal in Brachylophosaurus could be constmed as an autapomorphy ofthe genus, as Homer has provided some evidence that this process is, to some extent, diagnostic ofhadrosaur species . Some ofthe symplesiomorphies reported in justification ofthe exclusion of these forms from the rest ofthe Hadrosauridae, such as the broad nasal, short shelf over the foramen magnum and the wide caudal portion ofthe skull are very difficult to evaluate. The first is phrased in a manner difficult to interpret. It appears, however, to be autapomorphic for Brachylophosaurus , as such broad nasals are not present in non-hadrosaurid hadrosaurs. The nature ofthe overhang on the foramen magnum is very difficult to evaluate, as much depends on the degree to which a specimen is cmshed; it may represent little more than another autapomorphy of Brachylophosaurus. The wide \"postorbital\" portion ofthe skull appears to be a misinterpretation. Although Kritosaurus certainly is transversely wide through the quadrates, Brachylophosaurus seems little wider than other hadrosaurids, especially relative to the width through the postorbitals themselves {e.g., figures in Heaton [1972] ). Although data are limited, non-hadrosaurid hadrosaurs also appear to have occipital skull roofs significantly narrower than the width behind the orbits; apart from Iguanodon and Tenontosaurus, this appears to be a general feature of Cretaceous iguanodontians. Other characters cited by Homer, such as the faint circumnarial fossa and the nonreflected beak attachment surface on the premaxilla , appear to be the result of changes in the formation ofthe circumnarial stmcture . coalescence of circumnarial fossae over intemarial bar; loss of invasion of premaxillary beak attachment surface by circumnarial fossa ; elongate, horizontal rostrodorsal process ofthe maxilla; dorsal ascending process of caudal process of jugal reduced ; prominently developed squamosal buttress on quadrate; pedal unguals with plantar \"keel\" as well as referred specimens shows that the nasals ofthe type, and indeed most ofthe skull, is slightly disarticulated. Proper articulation shows that the snout, while somewhat deep, is smoothly and shallowly tapered rostrally. The nasal is somewhat more curved than in ancestral taxa, but is in no way recurved as it is in Kritosaurus . A new restoration of Brachylophosaurus peeblesorum shows that the two species of Brachylophosaurus are very similar in overall head form , and are distinct from Kritosaurus. This restoration is confirmed by a new \"Maiasaura\" skull at the ROM, which was cmshed laterally rather than the dorsoventral cmshing ofthe type and the oblique cmshing of OTM F138. Even without such new information, the numerous derived characters listed above support the hypothesized close relationship between these two species, as originally argued by Homer . Homer has emphasized the \"primitive\" nature ofthe cranium of Maiasaura, without considering non-hadrosaurid hadrosaurs such as Bactrosaurus johnsoni, and Gilmoreosaurus mongoliensis. This assertion is based on the Iguanodonlike rostrum interpreted for the type specimen, as well as confiision surrounding the crest and circumnarial fossa. Trexler insists that there is no \"nasal crest\" on Brachylophosaurus peeblesorum. Yet, the nasals clearly participate in the \"interorbital crest\" of this species, and the latter does clearly constitute a departure from the skull profile. That it does not closely resemble the crests of some other hadrosaurids is consistent with the hypothesis that these crests were instrumental in premating isolation ofthe various hadrosaurid species . Homer , as well as Trexler , has interpreted the circumnarial fossa as being present only in close proximity to the margin ofthe narial foramen in Weishampel et al, 1993) , although the definition applied here precludes this synonymy operationally. antitrochanter is much more prominent. Occurrence. Brown , has often been used in connection with an hypothesized clade of \"solid-crested\" hadrosaurs, generally including Saurolophus, \"Prosaurolophus,\" \"Tsintaosaurus,\" and sometimes Lophorothon {e.g., Young 1958 , Ostrom 1961 . The former two are here considered synonymous, while the latter are a lambeosaurine and a non-hadrosaur, respectively. There is substantial support for a Saurolophus + Edmontosaurus group among hadrosaurs, {e.g., Weishampel and Homer, 1990; Weishampel et al, 1993; Diagnosis. -At this time, this taxon cannot be diagnosed by autapomorphies. The prepubic process ofthe pubis is very similar in outline to that of Saurolophus spp. Occurrence.-Naashoibito member, Kirtland Shale, New Mexico Age.-Late Maastrichtian Discussion. -Lucas and Hunt described a hadrosaur postcranium from the Naashoibito Member ofthe Kirtland Shale as a lambeosaurine. Williamson assigned this specimen to Hadrosaurinae {sensu lato). The pubis appears to have a welldefined acetabular emargination, although the cranial limit of extension of that emargination onto the iliac peduncle cannot be determined due to breakage. The preserved portion ofthe prepubic blade appears to be identical to that of Saurolophus , which suggests that this animal may be a late surviving member of that genus. AMNH 5795 from the Naashoibito Member ofthe Kirtland Shale includes a maxilla that appears to have a caudally set dorsal process, which would support such an assignment. However, this specimen requires closer examination. offered in support of this species, the greater rostro-caudal length ofthe nasal crest in \"P. ", "meta": {"ref_id": "Wagner"}}
{"text": "blackfeetensis appears to be due partially to cmshing ofthe type skull, in which the prefrontal has been displaced ventral to the skull roof, which in tum has been rotated dorsally and laterally, accentuating the juvenile frontal dome and appearing to elongate the crest. Isolated nasals from adults show that the caudal margin ofthe crest was abmpt, and the rostro-ventral length short in adult animals. The other character, lack of expression ofthe circumnarial fossa on the prefrontal, again appears to be the result of cmshing in the type, as is the apparent lack of a prefrontal ridge. The prefrontal is illustrated in its cmshed orientation, rather than in life position. In life it would have been inclined dorsolaterally, and the broad fossa visible on its dorsal surface in photographs would be continuous with the circumnarial fossa. Since only the prefrontal ofthe type is illustrated, it is impossible to determine the situation in an adult ofthe putative species. The lateral margin ofthe circumnarial fossa illustrated on adult nasals appear to show the exclusion ofthe prefrontal from the fossa. However, this ridge is very similar in morphology to that observed in Saurolophus maximus , and without a prefrontal there is no support for this character. Thus, \"Prosaurolophus \" blackfeetensis is not distinct, and is here considered a junior synonym of Saurolophus maximus. Discussion.-The included taxa may represent the same species, as they are tmly separated only by the shape ofthe crest, which varies with growth in S. angustirostris .

Occurrence.-Numerous units in Alberta, the northem Great Plains and Rocky Mountain states. New Mexico, Texas, Mexico, and the People's Republic of China. Discussion.-Lambeosaurines are often characterized as having \"robust\" humeri with deltopectoral crests broader than the humeral shaft and that extend a great distance down the humeral shaft {e.g., Brett-Surman, 1975; Weishampel and Homer, 1990 ). Specimens of Kritosaurus cf. K. navajovius from Big Bend show that such proportions hold for large individuals of that taxon, and this feature may characterize Saurolophinae as well. However, examination of illustrated specimens shows that the proportion ofthe length ofthe humeral shaft to the diameter across the distal condyles is less than 4 for Lambeosaurinae, and greater than 4 for all other hadrosaurs. This proportional difference appears to be consistent, and may constitute a better description ofthe \"robust\" humems of lambeosaurines. Occurrence. , and the foraminal pattem ofthe maxilla is similar to that in Lambeosaurus, in that the caudal foramena are tightly wrapped around the jugal articulation . The sagittal crest is indeed high, although it appears that cmshing has de-emphasized the prominence of this feature in specimens of Hypacrosaurus casuarius, Parasaurolophus walkeri and Lambeosaurus magnicristatus. The second observation was made by Dodson who, in supporting the validity of the latter species, noted that one ofthe two known specimens of this species hails from a location \"more than 100 miles south ofthe principle locality, from a locality which was more subject to marine influence [the latter observation is referenced to W.

However, TMM 43679, a particularly large hadrosaur fi-om the Javelina that unquestionably represents an adult, possesses this texture. Nasal.-Both nasals of TMM-42452-1 are preserved, although both show evidence of damage and plastic distortion. The right nasal is better preserved, showing only minimal distortion along its caudal margin, and slight displacement of the dorsal process. Although, the left bone was somewhat flattened beneath its opposite number and the jugal , and has lost much of its caudal and ventral edges, it preser\\es more ofthe dorsal process. From the two specimens, it is possible to describe the original shape ofthe bone with reasonable confidence. The nasal is at least 23 cm long along the medial suture, and 11.3 cm from the dorsal margin at the base ofthe dorsal process to the ventral edge below the premaxillary articulation. The bone is lamellar, and is 10.5 mm thick at its thickest point, the inflection point where the skull roof begins to rise to the nasal arch. A general thickness ofthe bone cannot be determined as the inner surface ofthe bone was not completely prepared. However, a thickness of less than 5 mm is estimated for most ofthe surface ofthe bone, thinning at the edges, and thickening substantially at the medial suture on the skull roof This would suggest that Hopson's interpretation ofthe crest in Kritosaurus as an agonistic weapon is probably incorrect . The bone may be divided into two parts, the body and the dorsal process. The body makes an obtuse triangle in lateral view, with the apex ofthe triangle oriented rostrodorsally. Between the rostroventral vertex ofthe triangle and the columnar dorsal process lies the caudal extremity ofthe narial foramen. From the relationship ofthe medial suture to the rest ofthe bone, the dorsal surface ofthe nasal was roughly horizontal in life, with the lateral surface facing laterally, and in the rostral half, somewhat rostrolaterally. At the rostroventral vertex ofthe body is a shallow, narrow fossa no more than 1.5 cm across which, in articulation, is lapped laterally by the premaxilla. Although the caudal margin ofthe fossa is damaged on the right maxilla and not preserved on the left, it is clear from the preserved articular surfaces that the premaxilla did not contact the prefrontal on the lateral surface ofthe skull. Ventral to the premaxillary articulation, along the ventrocaudal margin ofthe bone, is a thin, rugose, rounded edge where the bone may have contacted the maxilla as in Edmontosaurus . Caudally the ventrocaudal edge thins, presumably for its insertion into the dorsal articular slot ofthe lacrimal, a thin, arcuate flat surface dorsal to the edge marks the region where the latter bone laps the nasal. Halfway along this surface is the inflection which marks the transition from a rostrolateral to a lateral orientation ofthe nasal body. Although the edge is damaged here, a sutural area may be discerned. This area is a smooth, dorsally oriented trapezoidal surface for articulation of the prefrontal. This surface cuhninates in a narrow, rostrocaudally-oriented, sharplytapering oval facet which is somewhat produced from the surface ofthe bone. This facet lies flush with the dorsal surface, is continuous with the inflected edge between the dorsal and lateral faces ofthe nasal, and articulated with the rostrodorsal edge ofthe prefrontal. Although incomplete, the thickened caudal extremity ofthe nasal body, which forms the caudodorsal vertex ofthe triangle, appears to penetrate between the frontals as described by Homer . This part ofthe skull roof is flexed dorsally in both nasals, and somewhat laterally in the right bone. This flexure is considered to be the result of post mortem distortion as, in both bones, it draws the edge ofthe medial articular surface out ofthe parasagital plane. The dorsal midline suture is thickened, as noted above, and grows thicker to the base ofthe dorsal process. The nasal contribution to the skull roof is broad, approximately 5 cm from the prefrontal joint to the sagital midline, while the prefrontal articular surface appears to be only 4 cm long rostrocaudally, for a ratio of 1.25 . Although comparison is difficult, figures in Homer and Parks give the same ratio for Kritosaurus \"\"latidens \" as 0.50, with specimens attributed to K \"incurvimanus''^ scoring 0.59 and 0.65, and specimens ofK navajovius having ratios of 0.40 and 0.33. Although the latter species has wider nasals partially obscured by overlapping prefrontals , I estimate that a tmly comparable ratio for K. navajovius would still be only 0.67. Thus, K. sp. nov. has a shorter prefrontal facet, a wider nasal, or, as interpreted here, both. The bone thins laterally, less so toward the point where the dorsal and lateral, as well as lateral and rostrolateral, planes ofthe bone converge. This area forms a thickened, rounded comer which is extended rostrally and caudally as a sort of \"brow ridge\" along the skull was apparently interpreted as the edge ofthe circumnarial fossa by Homer [1992, see above] ).

{"text": "This inflection may be a \"shelf for articulation ofthe edges of distal carpal 3 . The distal articulation is very slightly ginglymous, with a trapezoidal face. The outer \"condylar\" ridge ofthe articulation is oriented with the flexor/ extensor plane, while the inner ridge is angled medially in the flexor direction. The extensor comer of this ridge is contiguous with the flange described previously, but the flexor comer tapers back into the flexor surface ofthe bone. The ridge marking the ancestral medial flexor edge ofthe shaft is separated from its lateral counterpart approximately one-third ofthe way distally down the shaft, and crosses medially almost to the medial extensor flange, then tapers into the shaft, disappearing completely. Where it begins to taper, it fits into the distal groove on the inner face of metacarpal II. For most of their length, the second and third metacarpal are separated. The medial comer ofthe head of metacarpal III fits into the previously mentioned shallow facet near the head of metacarpal II, resulting in a two-point articulation of these bones. The unusual form of metacarpal III requires that otherwise ordinary metacarpal II articulate along its flexor surface. Thus, distal articular surfaces of these bones are oriented at nearly forty-five degrees to one another, while the proximal heads form an angle of approximately sixty degrees. This appears to represent an extteme case ofthe bunching of metacarpals into an oval orientation for strength observed by Dilkes , and forms the proximal heads of these bones, and the carpal, into a \"cup\" for support of the antebrachium. As noted earher, the ancestral flexor edges ofthe shaft separate about one third of the way down the length ofthe bone; two-thirds ofthe way down this, the lateral ridge becomes promment, meets the \"condylar\" ridge distally, and, with its neomorphic medial counterpart, encloses a shallow fossa on the distal flexor face ofthe bone. The lateral surface of metacarpal III shows a longitudinal trough from the head along two-thirds of its length to the lateral flexor ridge. The swelling which forms the flexor margin of this trough articulates within a similar trough on metacarpal IV. This articulation is difficult to assess, but appears to involve the latter bone extending somewhat farther proximally and on the extensor face ofthe manus than metacarpal III. The bones are tightly appressed for two-thirds ofthe length ofthe latter, beyond which metacarpal IV diverges. Metacarpal IV is 22 centimeters long, and resembles an enlarged mirror-image of metacarpal II. Although metacarpal IV is more robust, it differs from the latter bone in so few features that a complete description is unwarranted. The proximal articular head of metacarpal IV is less rounded than that in II, and it is somewhat more mediolaterally compressed, relative to its length. However, the primary difference in the two bones is in the orientation ofthe distal articulation. The distal two-thirds ofthe shaft of metacarpal rV retains the ancestral square cross-section. The lateral flexor ridge is somewhat more prominent than in metacarpal II; it almost reaches the articular head, but disappears over a short distance one third ofthe length down the bone. Above the resulting flat area, the ridge is sharp and prominent for the ligamentous attachment of metacarpal V. The distal articulation is twisted medially toward metacarpal EI, but the end of the bone is divergent, as noted above. The form ofthe distal articulation is modified toward the state observed in the latter bone, with the development of a slight flange on the medial flexor comer ofthe shaft. The articulation is non-ginglymous, and appears almost squared-off; as with metacarpal E there is little indication of a preferred direction of movement. The metacarpal/ phalangeal joints ofthe inner three digits in this specimen, and indeed all hadrosaurids, suggests the development of plane joints. While this might reflect a tendency toward greater freedom of movement, it seems more likely that the first phalanges were bound together by ligaments. What movement was possible at this joint would have been guided the slightly ginglymous metacarpal IE/ phalanx El' joint. The non-ginglymous phalanx IIV11^ joint, which is aligned with the metacarpal/ first phalanx joints ofthe other digits, may have been more loosely bound. The functional unity ofthe hadrosaur manus is discussed briefly by Paul . Metacarpal V is substantially different from the others, being shorter at 9 centimeters, and stubbily proportioned. In keeping with the curving ofthe metacarpus around metacarpal IE, this bone articulates on the flexor portion ofthe lateral face of metacarpal IV, such that its head is just distal to that ofthe latter bone, and is divergent from that of metacarpal IV by approximately thirty degrees. A prominent trough on the inner side of metacarpal V accepts the ridge on metacarpal IV, and the distal articulation of metacarpal V is appressed to the smooth intermption in this ridge. Metacarpal V is somewhat curved, concave toward the extensor face ofthe manus. It appears very similar to metacarpal IV, albeit quite foreshortened. The proximal head is only weakly convex along its edges, and is pitted and slightly concave in the center. However, there is a slight raised lip which ascends the side of metacarpal IV in a shallow trough above the articular ridge on that bone. In cross-section, the articular face is kidney-shaped around the articular trough. The shaft sports striations extending from one to 1.5 centimeters down the shaft from the head similar to those on the other metacarpals. Metacarpal V is twisted nearly forty-five degrees along its stubby shaft to place the distal articulation in a strongly divergent orientation. The distal articulation is slightly cmshed, but remains divergent, orienting the digit outward . Phalanges.-Phalanges of TMM 42452-1 represent only the first two ranks, apart from the third phalanx of digit V. The absence ofthe distalmost phalanges suggests a distal-proximal disarticulation sequence, and thus decomposition in the presence of water . However, there appears to be a discrete tendon attachment on the flexor face of each penultimate phalanx in TMM 42452-1 . It is possible that the associated tendons kept all but the distal phalanges associated. The first rank of phalanges are all approximately seven to eight centimeters long, and are, at first glance remarkably similar. Phalanx II' has the classic \"dumbbell\" shape of manual phalanges, with slightly expanded proximal and distal ends. The body ofthe phalanx is compressed in the flexor-extensor direction, and strongly flattened on its flexor face. The distal articulation is somewhat offset outward relative to, but still parallel with, the proximal articulation, resulting in a skewed appearance in flexor and extensor view. The shaft has a compressed oval cross-section, with subtle ridges along the flexor edges; the inner edge is somewhat thinner, reflecting the fact that the bone is skewed away from this direction distally. The distal articular surface is rounded, and forms a compressed oval in cross section. It is somewhat ginglymous, in that a rounded surface with an extension onto the flexor face similar to those observed on better-developed phalangeal condyles is present on this outer half. The inner half is less well-defined, and is of smaller diameter, but is damaged, making these observations suspect. The articular surface extends well up onto the extensor surface ofthe phalanx, indicating the capacity for hyperextension. The proximal articular surface is shaped as a rounded ttapezoid, with the extensor side shortest. The articular surface faces slightly toward the extensor direction, also indicating hyperextendability. The lateral edges extend slightly farther proximally that the extensor and flexor edges, but the surface is by no means ginglymous. In articulation, the articular axes of both the proximal and distal joints is roughly thirty degrees divergent from the flexor-extensor plane of metacarpal E. In combination with the divergence evidenced by metacarpal II, the distal end of this digit must have diverged as much as ninety degrees from the axis of metacarpal IE. Phalanx IE is more dumbbell-shaped, and is less flattened on its extensor face. The proximal articulation is again trapezoidal and nearly flat, but with slightly raised lateral edges. The distal articular surface is well produced from the shaft, highly rounded, and has a saddle-shaped, ginglymous articular surface. The lateral condyle is larger and more rounded, resulting in a medially-directed digit in articulation. Phalanx IV' resembles II' somewhat. The phalanx has been deepened in the flexor-extensor direction, and flattened inward . The resuh is a triangular shaft, with a short, concave flexor surface and a short inner surface, opposed to a long, slightly convex surface representing the combined outer and extensor surfaces. The border between these first two surfaces forms a rounded medial flexor ridge between two longitudinal troughs on one side ofthe bone, and leads to one ofthe distal \"condyles.", "meta": {"ref_id": "Wagner"}}

{"text": "11: Trigonometric model used to estimate bipedal maximum feeding heights for hadrosaurids, thescelosaurids, leptoceratopsids, and pachycephalosaurids \" function in the R package \"MASSTIMATE\" was used to estimate the body masses at which hadrosaurids and ceratopsids would have surpassed the maximum feeding heights of small ornithischian taxa. This function takes advantage of the universal and highly conserved relationship between proximal weightbearing limb bone circumferences and body mass observed in extant terrestrial mammalian and reptilian quadrupeds to construct a bivariate regression from which body masses of dinosaurs can be calculated from humeral and femoral circumferences . Taphonomic processes are important to consider because they can impact how likely a specimen is to enter the fossil record. For example, bonebeds often originate due to flooding events, which involve rapid burial of skeletal elements, causing the preservational potential to be higher than 'normal' conditions . Many bonebeds represent mass death assemblages comprised of several to thousands of individuals of a single species. Unlike small ornithischians, many megaherbivore clades were likely gregarious for at least part of the year , and so comprise the majority of such monodominant bonebeds ; small ornithischians are more often preserved as isolated individuals. By including these monodominant bonebeds in the dataset, there is a risk of potentially biasing the results towards higher proportions of megaherbivores because it requires less effort to recover the remains of multiple individuals from a single site than it does to recover multiple individuals from multiple sites . The same can be said for the inclusion of nesting sites, as many more megaherbivore nesting sites have been recovered . Microsites on the other hand, often contain small elements from a variety of taxa which, in some instances, have been concentrated by physical processes. Because microsites, bonebeds and nests are instances where multiple individuals can be preserved, it is important to take steps to prevent artificial inflation in the number of individuals represented at each site due potential 'duplication'. To reduce the potential for such 'duplication', femora of similar sizes originating from different sides of the body were removed from the dataset . Differences in lithology are also important to consider due to the relationship between grain size and flow energy . Small bones can be transported at lower flow velocities and over greater distances than larger elements . The farther an element is transported from its source, the more likely it is to be destroyed . This means that smaller elements are less likely to be preserved in the fossil record, even if they were actually more common than larger elements, especially in river channel settings . To control for these biases while investigating relative abundances of small ornithischians and megaherbivores, femoral lengths were measured and information regarding taphonomic mode and lithology was collected. Femoral length was used because it is known to scale isometrically with body size in terrestrial vertebrates and because femoral shapes are robust, easy to identify and broadly similar between ornithischian taxa, making their transportation potential at equal lengths comparable . Only ceratopsian and hadrosaur femora that were of the same length or shorter than the largest small ornithischian femur were included in the dataset to compare abundances at small body sizes. For simplicity, ceratopsid and hadrosaurid femora were grouped together under a \"megaherbivore\" category while leptoceratopsid, thescelosaurid, and pachycephalosaurid femora were grouped under a \"small ornithischian\" category. After importing the data into R v. 3.6.1 , the specimens were plotted on a histogram using the \"geom_histogram\" function in the \"ggplot\" package The raw data are provided in Appendix K and sample sizes are provided in Table 4 .2. The first two PC axes account for 81.5% of the total variation within the dataset . Loading plots for these axes are provided in Appendix L. Immature megaherbivores and all small ornithischians are separated from mature megaherbivores along PC1 due to their overall smaller sizes . Along PC2, a large amount of overlap occurs between leptoceratopsids and juvenile ceratopsids, and thescelosaurids and juvenile hadrosaurids . Pachycephalosaurids show some overlap between immature hadrosaurids , leptoceratopsids and immature ceratopsids. Snout shape index loads heavily and negatively along PC2, followed by paroccipital process breadth . Snout depression, distance from Most taxa show overlap along PC3 except for ceratopsids, which do not exhibit any overlap with pachycephalosaurids . Overlap between juvenile ceratopsids and hadrosaurids along PC3 is minimal. The lack of overlap between ceratopsids and pachycephalosaurids and the minimal amount of overlap between ceratopsids and hadrosaurids may be due to small sample sizes for juvenile ceratopsids, as there is likely variation within the population unaccounted for. However, because a wide range of sizes have been sampled, this overlap will likely remain relatively minimal-even with increased sample sizes. Along PC3, SSI, occiput height, skull height and distance from the distal end of the tooth row to the middle of the quadrate load negatively, and snout width, snout length and the distance from the coronoid apex to the middle jaw joint load positively . Overlap is observed for all taxa along PC4, PC5 and PC6 . The omnibus tests for the rarified NPMANOVA indicate statistically significant differences between some of the small ornithischians and juvenile megaherbivores considered in the size-corrected dataset . To increase the power of post-hoc pairwise tests, comparisons were made between thescelosaurids, pachycephalosaurids and juvenile megaherbivores because, based on the results of the PCA, thescelosaurids and pachycephalosaurids showed the most separation between each other and with juvenile megaherbivores. Leptoceratopsids were not considered because this group exhibited some overlap with other small ornithischian taxa and overlap with juvenile megaherbivores along all PCs. Even though significant differences were detected by the omnibus test, post-hoc pairwise NPMANOVAs were unable to identify groups that significantly differed from one-another . From the results of these post-hoc comparisons, it is expected that pachycephalosaurids would be significantly different from all other taxa, as these comparisons yielded the least significant p-values. Raw postcranial data and feeding height estimates are provided in Appendix O.1. The estimated feeding heights for all specimens from the five ornithischian families are depicted in Figure 4 .14 and given in Appendix O.2. Of the small ornithischian taxa, leptoceratopsids were the most restricted and unable to reach much higher than 1 m, even when assuming a bipedal feeding posture. Most pachycephalosaurids and thescelosaurids were also restricted feeding at or below ~1.5 m, with the exception of a single large Thescelosaurus , which has a feeding height of ~2 m. Hadrosaurids would have surpassed the feeding heights of all small ornithischians when they reached a bipedal feeding height of ~2.3 m. Ceratopsids would have fed within the same height ranges as most small ornithischians, as the maximum ceratopsid feeding height is estimated at around ~ 1.3 m . The only small ornithischians that ceratopsids surpassed in feeding height were the leptoceratopsids, and this only occurred at very large adult body sizes . .14: Maximum feeding heights calculated for megaherbivores throughout ontogeny and adult small ornithischian taxa. Each point represents a feeding height calculated for a single specimen .

Vega. The raw femoral dataset is provided in Appendix P. Young megaherbivore femora generally outnumber those of small ornithischians . This is particularly true for bonebed-and mudstone-hosted occurrences. Isolated and sandstonehosted occurrences exhibit no significant differences in abundance. Within the combined dataset, megaherbivores significantly outnumbered small ornithischians for femora <100 mm, and between 400 and 600 mm . Megaherbivores outnumber small ornithischians in mudstone deposits for femora between 200 and 500 mm in length. In the bonebed dataset, megaherbivores also outnumber small ornithischians for femora <100 mm in length and between 300 and 500 mm. No significant differences were observed otherwise. It was predicted that, if competition at small body sizes led to the left-skewed body size distributions observed for Late Cretaceous North American herbivorous dinosaurs, then small ornithischians should have been isolated from similar-sized megaherbivores within the ecomorphospace. Overlap is not observed between some similar-sized ornithischians in both the size-corrected and size-included ecomorphospaces, and is generally consistent with the predictions made by the competition hypothesis. In the size-corrected ecomorphospace, some separation is also observed between juvenile megaherbivores and pachycephalosaurids and thescelosaurids. Even though the rarified omnibus NPMANOVA results did indicate that there were at least some significant differences between groups, post-hoc tests could not identify which groups differed -likely due to low power. Despite being unable to detect statistical differences between groups, there were likely differences between small ornithischian taxa as well as between pachycephalosaurids and juvenile megaherbivores based on separation along the first two PCs in the size-corrected ecomorphospace. The inability to detect significant differences between groups in posthoc tests and distributions in the ecomorphospace indicates that, despite some results being consistent with the competition hypothesis, there are further considerations to be made regarding sample sizes and potential deviations from the predictions made regarding separation. In the size-corrected dataset, the maximum number of individuals that could be selected from each group is small . Despite this limitation, a large amount of variance was accounted for especially in the thescelosaurid, pachycephalosaurid, and hadrosaurid subsets, as individuals from a variety of different sizes are included. In addition, the data were rarified and permuted to make statistical comparisons more robust. Given that all currently available and usable juvenile megaherbivores and small ornithischians from the Late Cretaceous of North America were sampled, the results presented here are the best estimates currently available for investigations into potential for competition at small body sizes. When more specimens are found that are suitable for ecomorphological investigations, it will be important to conduct a follow-up study to determine how and if the results presented here change with larger sample sizes. Post-hoc power tests suggest that at least six more specimens per family would be needed, based on the effect size of the current dataset . The ecomorphological overlap between leptoceratopsids and juvenile megaherbivores also demands some attention as it does not necessarily follow from the competition hypothesis. One possibility is that these taxa were still experiencing some competitive process on the palaeolandscape. Another possibility is that they were separated along some other niche dimension that was not or could not be considered here . Given that leptoceratopsids and ceratopsids coexisted throughout the Late Cretaceous -a duration of ~10 million years -separation along another niche dimension is quite probable. It is also important to consider how these morphological differences may have impacted feeding ecology. Two organisms may feed on the same resource but possess different morphological features that would allow them to feed on this resource. Because the taxa investigated here belong to different families, it is likely that there are phylogenetic and/or behavioural differences that could contribute to the differences in morphology detected along PC1 and 2 in the size-corrected ecomorphospace. Absolute size differences have implications for feeding selectivity, bite forces and The deeper mandibles and taller skulls in leptoceratopsids and juvenile megaherbivores would have provided better resistance against bending stresses generated during biting of mechanically resistant materials . The greater distance between the coronoid process apex and jaw joint observed in leptoceratopsids and juvenile megaherbivores would have also enabled them to process more mechanically resistant materials by positioning the coronoid apex more anteriorly relative to the distal end of the tooth row, increasing mechanical advantage, and consequently, bite force . Taxonomic differences in overall snout length and depression would have had consequences for feeding behaviour due to differences in relative bite forces generated at the snout tip. Shortening of the snout and/or increases in ventral deflection of the snout would increase bite forces generated at the cropping mechanism by moving the bite point caudally . In modern bovids, differences in paroccipital process breadth and occiput height are correlated with differences in feeding behaviour . Unlike browsers, which use their tongues and lips to pluck vegetation off of branches, grazers use sharp head motions to sever vegetation gripped between the incisors. Because the paroccipital and occipital areas are areas for the insertion of cervical musculature, increases in the width of the paroccipital processes and height of the occiput correspond to increases in the size of this musculature. Hadrosaurs, ceratopsians and thescelosaurids would have lacked lips altogether, instead possessing a hard, keratinous sheath over the rostral bone/premaxilla, and would have therefore had to rely on head movements or increased forces at the snout tip to sever vegetation . The wider paroccipital processes and taller occiputs in juvenile megaherbivores and leptoceratopsids may be reflective of the relatively more important role of sharp head movements made during feeding as bite forces generated at the snout tip may have not been enough to sever vegetation. The narrower paroccipital processes in thescelosaurids and pachycephalosaurids, on the other hand, may indicate that these taxa relied on higher relative bite forces at the tip of the snout to sever vegetation, rather than sharp head movements. Increasing size would have been especially important for hadrosaurids as it relates to feeding height. Feeding height and body mass estimates indicate that hadrosaurid feeding height would have exceeded that of the largest small ornithischian specimen at ~335 kg. Based on the calculated growth curves for Maiasaura , this means that hadrosaurids would have outgrown their small ornithischian competitors within the first year of life. This 'escape' from competition with small ornithischians is known as competitive release , which occurs when the niche of an organism expands in the absence of a competitor. Thus, when hadrosaurids were able to outreach and process more mechanically resistant food than their small-bodied ornithischian competitors, they were able to expand their niche as suggested by the fanning of megaherbivore data within the size-included ecomorphospace. Competitive release may have also occurred in ceratopsids; however, this release would have only been a result of niche expansion due to increasing bite forces. Feeding height would not have helped to alleviate competition because ceratopsids would have only exceeded the maximum feeding height of leptoceratopsids by ~4400 kg-a size that, for most ceratopsids would have been attained sometime during adulthood. In addition, even the largest ceratopsids were unable to outreach thescelosaurids and pachycephalosaurids as the maximum feeding heights for these taxa are greater than the maximum 1.3 m feeding height attained by ceratopsids. In animals undergoing ONSs, ecological release from resource competition may be accelerated by higher intrinsic growth rates at sizes where competitive pressure is highest . With this \"optimistic growth\" strategy, these higher intrinsic growth rates mean that individuals spend less time in size classes where competition for resources are relatively high. However, the trade-off is that the probability of surviving to larger size classes is reduced due to a competitive juvenile bottleneck. \"Optimistic growth\" strategies also have implications for the competitor. In situations where the other competitor species does not shift its niche with size, lower intrinsic growth rates are expected because the non-shifting species experiences competition for their entire life cycles. It is possible that hadrosaurids and ceratopsids also evolved an \"optimistic growth\" strategy as there is high potential for ONSs in these groups and growth rates in the first couple years of life are known to be high . Small ornithischians are also known to have secondarily developed slower growth rates compared to these larger dinosaurs -potentially due to competition . Future research investigating if higher growth rates observed in large-bodied dinosaurs secondarily evolved may provide further support for this concept of \"optimistic growth\". Interspecific competition is often highly asymmetric and stronger interspecific competitors will typically outcompete weak interspecific competitors . Because megaherbivores appeared to have been able to escape competition after a certain point in their development , this would have made them potentially better competitors than small ornithischians . Competitive asymmetry is expected to influence the relative densities of the competing taxa where the better interspecific competitor is expected to be more abundant than the weak interspecific competitor. Thus, assuming interspecific competition was more important than intraspecific competition , and competitive asymmetry, juvenile megaherbivores should be relatively more abundant than small ornithischians under taphonomic equivalency. Overall, the distributions and p-values for chi-squared tests match this prediction. Even though small ornithischians outnumber megaherbivores as isolated occurrences, this is not completely unexpected given that small ornithischians are commonly interpreted as having been solitary animals . Thus, it is more likely that they would be preserved as isolated individuals compared to the more gregarious megaherbivores. Similarities in the relative number of small ornithischians and megaherbivores in sandstones may also be a result of transportation. As discussed previously, small elements have higher transportation potential. Thus, remains found in sandstones are less likely to represent true ecological assemblages. Dodson et al. proposed that small ornithischians preferred upland settings which have poor preservational potential compared to floodplain/fluvial settings. If small ornithischians did prefer, and were more abundant in, upland settings, then, potentially, rivers may have carried small ornithischian remains from the uplands and deposited them in the lowland areas where megaherbivores are typically found, thus producing a deposit with statistically similar proportions of megaherbivores and small ornithischians. Distinguishing this would require more taphonomic information . In short, there does appear to be some influence of competition and taphonomy in the observed body size distributions. It is also worth noting that there are no instances where small ornithischians significantly outnumber megaherbivores as may be expected if taphonomy were purely responsible for the shaping of these communities. Dinosaur assemblages exhibit a bias towards larger-bodied herbivores, which runs contrary to modern mammal communities. Some workers proposed that dinosaur communities were so different because of competition between juvenile megaherbivores and small ornithischians, which limited the relative abundances of the latter . The present study demonstrates, providing some evidence for the competition hypothesis. This is further attested by the generally greater abundances of the immature megaherbivores under taphonomic equivalency. However, some caution is needed with the interpretation of these results at face value as it is also possible that these taxa partitioned resources along other niche dimensions that were not/could not be accounted for in these analyses. Because niche partitioning is expected to originate under conditions of strong competitive pressure, it should be expected that ancestral assemblages should exhibit more overlap in ecomorphospace. Under the competition hypothesis, it also follows that these ancestral assemblages should also contain a greater diversity of small species. However, research to this end is required. Given their larger adult body sizes and oviparous nature , megaherbivorous dinosaurs experienced more complex life histories than mammals, which would have resulted in differences in overall community structure. Results presented in chapters 2 and 3 provide evidence for changes in niche occupation through ontogeny which would have allowed megaherbivorous dinosaurs to occupy various roles within the ecosystem. During ontogeny, ceratopsids and hadrosaurids experienced changes in size and shape would have enabled them to escape competition with small ornithischians and broaden their occupied niches. Expansion of these niches would have increased survivorship as there would have been less competition for resources at larger body sizes, resulting in their relatively higher observed abundances in the fossil record. Conversely, small ornithischians would have remained in these competitive bottlenecks and remained relatively limited in terms of diversity and abundance. This study is the first to investigate if competition produced left-skewed body size-species richness distributions of herbivorous dinosaurs of Late Cretaceous North America from an ecomorphological perspective. Presently, only a handful of individuals from each family have been collected and are available for study. These small sample sizes may not accurately reflect morphological variation within these groups despite the individuals included representing a range of body sizes . Once more adequate specimens are found and made available for study, follow-up investigations will be prudent to test the findings presented here. Research into dental microwear may also prove useful as analyses of dental microwear in both extinct and extant animals have been shown to reflect dietary differences . Again, caution should be used with the interpretation of competition based exclusively on overlap within reconstructed ecomorphospace as partitioning can occur along other dimensions which were not or cannot be accounted for. Future investigations into relative abundances will also be needed once more complete and detailed specimen locality information can be obtained as this will increase the power of statistical tests conducted on lithological and taphonomic mode subsets allowing researchers to construct a more detailed picture of how these dinosaurs were distributed across the landscape. Given the incomplete nature of the fossil record and the complexity of dinosaur ecosystems, competition and taphonomy appear to have both played a role in shaping the observed distributions of dinosaur communities. Late Cretaceous North America hosted an array of large- and smallbodied herbivorous dinosaurs . Multiple questions have arisen regarding how so many herbivores could have occupied the same landmass at the same time. Megaherbivores comprised 75-82% of the total dinosaur fauna in terms of abundance, and in some instances up to six species of megaherbivores coexisted at one time . Previous research has shown that adult megaherbivores were able to coexist via niche partitioning . However, little is known about the roles juvenile megaherbivores and smaller-bodied ornithischians played in these communities. It was proposed that, because dinosaur life strategies were likely different from those of mammals , young megaherbivores occupied their own ecological roles and were potentially important competitors of small ornithischians . Unlike mammals, dinosaurs were oviparous and experienced multi-year growth, which likely meant that they had more complex life histories . Thus, dinosaurs would have been nestbound and required parental care for some period of time after hatching, further extending the length of the breeding season and spatially and temporally restricting reproductively mature adults to nesting areas for most of the year . Non-breeding individuals, on the other hand, would have been mobile year-round and probably relied on resources farther away from nesting areas to reduce competition and/or because territorial breeders drove them away from the area. Thus, differences in dietary requirements would have allowed breeding and non-breeding individuals to form separate aggregations and occupy different areas of the landscape . The greater complexity of dinosaur life histories may have also meant that dinosaur ecosystems were controlled by different processes than mammalian ecosystems. In both modern and extinct mammalian ecosystems, smaller animals are more abundant and diverse compared to larger animals . In Late Cretaceous North American dinosaur ecosystems, however, smaller-bodied ornithischians, such as leptoceratopsids, thescelosaurids and pachycephalosaurids, were relatively less diverse and less abundant than larger taxa . This bias towards megaherbivores was proposed to be the result of competition between similar-sized juvenile megaherbivores and small ornithischians, which ultimately limited the diversity of the latter if the assemblage represented the result of strong competitive forces acting over evolutionary history. It would also be expected that this past competition would have limited the abundance and richness of small ornithischian species, especially if megaherbivores exhibited \"optimistic growth\" . If taphonomic biases were responsible for the body size distributions observed in Late Cretaceous assemblages, then, when accounting for these biases, small ornithischians are expected to be as or more abundant than megaherbivores. Chapter 4 demonstrated potential competition between some juvenile megaherbivores and small ornithischians, specifically between leptoceratopsids and juvenile megaherbivores, as other small ornithischian clades are separated from other groups within the ecomorphospace. However, this separation is also to be expected as an end-result under conditions of strong competition. Regardless of which groups of small ornithischians juvenile megaherbivores competed with, megaherbivores would have outgrown their competitors, undergoing ecological release and expanding their occupied niches . Codron et al. . Another issue that arises from working with dental microwear is that postmortem damage can obscure wear potentially reducing samples sizes even further. How dental microwear is measured can also create issues of comparability with other studies because there can be variability not only in working magnification, but also in the numbers of features counted between observers . The inclusion of measurements taken from composite reconstructions is another important consideration that must be made. Composite reconstructions are typically produced by scaling and combining material belonging to multiple individuals into a single skull . This process makes assumptions regarding how these elements may have actually scaled with size. Sometimes these assumptions are not even made using material from the same genus. Other times assumptions regarding relative proportions are best guesses made using material from closely-related taxa. The inclusion of such composites can thus create a false representation of morphological variability within a population. Attempts were made to reduce the amount of error associated with the use of such composites in my datasets by only selecting composite specimens produced from individuals of the same taxon from the same bonebed . While this makes fewer assumptions, there is still the opportunity for error to be introduced because variation across multiple individuals is being concentrated and treated as a \"single\" individual. Because samples sizes are especially limited for certain taxa , it is necessary to use these constructions but acknowledge that these reconstructions can potentially introduce error into analyses. There are also possible issues with using morphology as an ecological proxy. Even though anatomical features have been shown to be closely correlated with diet, habitat and feeding behaviours in modern animals , there are some aspects of an organism's ecology that will not be accounted for in its skeletal morphology. Modern animals may have similar morphologies but not compete with each other due to differences in, for example, habitat preference, diel activity, and migration patterns . In ornithischian dinosaurs, this creates some difficulties because there are no extant descendants relative available to study. It is therefore impossible to know for certain if, for example, two taxa were active at the same times of day or if they occupied the same area at the same time. This means that, even though leptoceratopsids do overlap in ecomorphospace with juvenile megaherbivores , they may have still partitioned resources along another niche dimension that was not or could not be accounted for. Lastly, error can be introduced through the use of a time-averaged dataset. For competition to even potentially occur, taxa must overlap in both space and time . In the case of the present study, it was necessary to include specimens from various formations to achieve a sample size large enough for analysis. However, because taxa were sampled from various formations, the datasets were time-averaged over ~10 Myr. This means that many specimens never overlapped in time and/or space and therefore did not comprise a \"true\" ecological community. However, because of the nature of the fossil record, there is no real way to study community-level interactions without time-averaging being present in the dataset. All than can be done is to acknowledge that the sample is time-averaged and how this time-averaging may influence the results. Therefore, the present analyses were still conducted even though the samples were time-averaged because the basic composition of Late Cretaceous communities remain broadly similar through time and space . Thus, the structuring of Late Cretaceous communities should be broadly similar. Additionally, if overlap does not occur at all even when there is time averaging then overlap will be absent even at finer temporal and spatial scales. Research into ONSs in other taxa could provide further insight into factors influencing the structure of other dinosaur communities. Morphological changes have been shown to occur during Diplodocus ontogeny and have been cited as evidence for an ONS . As in Late Cretaceous communities, the Late Jurassic Morrison Formation also shows relatively higher abundances of large-bodied taxa compared to smaller-bodied taxa . Potentially, the structuring of the Morrison palaeocommunities were influenced by sauropod ONSs in much the same way that hadrosaurid and ceratopsid ONSs appear to have influenced the structuring of Late Cretaceous North American communities. Ontogenetic niche shifts may have also had important implications for the structuring of other palaeocommunities. Lakin and Longrich proposed that the piscivorous theropod, Spinosaurus also underwent ONSs based on size disparity through ontogeny and absence of any hatchling-sized material. This relative absence of juvenile material is likely not related to taphonomy because smaller theropods with similar preservation potential have been recovered from the Kem Kem beds. The Cretaceous Kem Kem beds from which many of these remains have been found, show unusually high abundances of spinosaurids compared to other theropod taxa . Undergoing an ONS would have reduced intra-specific competition giving spinosaurids a competitive advantage over other theropods similar to how ONSs in North American megaherbivores gave them a competitive advantage over small ornithischians. Ontogenetic niche shifts have also been proposed for other carnivorous dinosaur taxa based on morphological differences observed through ontogeny . These ONSs may also explain negatively-skewed body size distributions observed in carnivorous taxa as well as why observed predator/prey proportions in some dinosaur communities are higher than predictions made using mammalian predator/prey proportions and relationships. For example, in the Hell Creek Formation, medium-sized predators between 200 and 900 kg are virtually absent . Differences in the shape of the skull may have allotted different ontogenetic stages different mechanical advantages, allowing different stages to consume different prey and potentially occupying all available niche space that would otherwise be occupied by other medium-to large-bodied predators. In T. rex, juvenile skulls are more gracile and probably unable to withstand bending stresses generated by bite forces needed to process bone, thus restricting them to consuming softer animal materials. Other tyrannosaurids exhibit a similar shift from a more gracile to more robust morphotype over ontogeny suggesting which could not be distinguished from normal. This would suggest that negativelyskewed size distributions were present in terrestrial ecosystems by the Triassic. However, Figure 5 .1: Log2-transformed basal skull length distributions of carnivores and herbivores from six assemblages zones in the Karoo Permo-Triassic sequence . The graphs show the means and 95% confidence intervals taken from 1000 random subsamples. Subsample sizes were equal to the smallest sample in the sequence. Abbreviations: AZassemblage zone. in the Middle to Late Jurassic Yanliao Biota in Northeastern China, sauropodomorphs and other vertebrates larger than a few kg are completely absent from this fauna . The cause of this absence is uncertain but taphonomic and collection biases are at least partly responsible for these absences as most deposits are lacustrine and most excavations of this biota have been conducted commercially. What can be said for certain is that archosaur/dinosaur communities were dominated by larger-bodied taxa by the Late Jurassic of North America . Palaeontologists have proposed a variety of different reasons to explain the structuring of dinosaurian communities . The results of the present study provide some support the role of ONSs in community dynamics. Like North American assemblages, some assemblages from other parts of the world also show a bias towards larger bodied taxa . However, other assemblages do not. For example, iguanodontids and Hypsilophodon are the most common taxa found in Early Cretaceous Wessex Formation assemblages . A mixture of both large and small taxa also dominate various deposits throughout the Haţeg Basin of Late Cretaceous Romania . Other assemblages even exhibit a bias towards smaller-bodied taxa. The Lower Cretaceous Jehol Group in Liaoning, China the small ceratopsian Psittacosaurus is typically the most common herbivorous dinosaur recovered . Small to medium-sized animals are also relatively more abundant than large animals within the arid eolian deposits of the Late Cretaceous Djadokhta Formation in Inner Mongolia . This is unexpected based on the research presented by Noto and Grossman which suggested small taxa were less common in more arid conditions due to relatively lower densities of low-lying groundcover to protect against predators and to support a vast array of herbivores. To gain insight into why dinosaur assemblages from other parts of the world are not always negativelyskewed, future research will need to consider how interactions between and within a species through ontogeny structured these communities and how taphonomy may have altered those distributions. In modern oviparous non-mammalian animals, such as crocodilians, ONSs are more often the norm rather than the exception . Given that animals comprising the extant phylogenetic bracket for dinosaurs undergo ONSs, and that many dinosaurs experience long growth trajectories , it is likely that ONSs occurred more commonly in dinosaurs than is presently known. While the results presented here represent a good first step in providing insight into other factors influencing the structuring of dinosaur communities, further research will be needed to better understand how the interactions between species as well as within a species through ontogeny structured dinosaur communities and how these interactions are masked by taphonomic processes to produce the archosaur body size distributions currently observed in the fossil record.

{"text": "The brief foreword, by Robert May, describes the 1967 book as a seminal contribution to theoretical ecology, and specifically to community ecology, to the extent that he uses the words \"island\" and biogeography\" only in reference to In contrast, the Preface by Losos and Ricklefs also emphasizes the role of the 1967 book in the transition from descriptive to analytical approaches, but they explicitly emphasize islands, biogeography, and the changing conceptualization of the dynamics of island biotas. It is to the credit of the editors that they adopted a liberal approach to the selection of contributors to this volume, in which this contrast between \"island biogeography as metaphor for theoretical ecology\" and \"islands as real places with complex dynamics\" is on display. Even so, there is much about island biogeography as a field of study that is left out. Examination of the index illustrates well what is and is not covered here: among the topics generously represented in the index are the terms archipelagoes, birds, colonization, competition, divergence, diversity, equilibrium, exploitation, extinction, food web, habitat fragmentation, immigration, metapopulation dynamics, neutral theory, population biology, predators, trophic regimes, and turnover. Not appearing in the index, and absent conceptually from many chapters in the volume, are the terms adaptive radiation, geology, historical, persistence, phylogeography, phylogenetics, reproduction, speciation, tectonics, and vicariance. Not all of MacArthur and Wilson's insights continue to bear fruit. It is striking that a field of study that blossomed and became prominent in the 1970s and 1980s as an outgrowth of the 1967 volume, that of life history tactics as typified by the terms r-and K-selection, has seemingly disappeared, supporting the contention of Lomolino et al. that a contraction of the 1967 theory took place. Another, greater contraction is discussed below: the exclusion of speciation as an intrinsic, dynamic process in island biogeography. The volume begins with a brief retrospective by E. O. Wilson on the origin of the 1963 paper and 1967 book, followed by two insightful chapters that focus on the early development and tests of the equilibrium model, by Lomolino et al. and Schoener; these should be required reading for any student of island biogeography. All three chapters make it clear that the intent of the 1967 volume was to de-emphasize the role of geological change and the long-term historical development of island biotas, and to develop a theoretical framework that was ecological, mathematical, and subject to direct experimentation and testing. It was, in my personal estimation, an effort to model the maintenance, not the origin, of biodiversity, because aside from brief sections that Lomolino et al. point out as having been lost in a subsequent contraction of the theory, it explicitly excluded \"deep-time\" and evolutionary phenomena. It is tempting to divide the remaining chapters into two groups, those that fall within the framework of the 1967 volume, and especially that of the iconic equilibrium model, and those that strike out into new territory. That, however, would be badly misleading. Chapters by Hanski, Holt, Hubbell, Laurence, Simberloff & Collins, Terborgh, and Velland & Orrock all deal with issues intrinsic to the equilibrium model and theoretical aspects of ecological dynamics of species at a community level, and in that sense they carry on the tradition. However, those by Hanski and Laurence, and Holt to a substantial extent, explicitly view patterns of species richness and community composition as representing the sum of disparate parts that must be analyzed independently, and they decry an \"excessive emphasis on speciesarea relationships\" , and advocate analysis of single-species incidence functions and the complex and hugely varied differential colonization and extinction patterns, based on species' autecology. The contrast could hardly be more extreme with the perspective of Hubbell, who largely accepts the implication of the equilibrium model that \"species [are] ecologically equivalent ... in their probabilities of immigrating ... and going extinct\" . Hubbell sees the simplicity of the equilibrium model as one of its greatest strengths, and states that we should \"... add complexity slowly, ... when absolutely necessary, kicking and screaming the whole time\" . I believe that, based on chapters in this volume, a strong case could be made that, whether or not there has been kicking and screaming, a new paradigm of community ecology has developed that no longer relies on the equilibrium model as the pri-news and update ISSN 1948-6596 95 frontiers of biogeography 2.4, 2011 -© 2011 the authors; journal compilation © 2011 The International Biogeography Society mary framework, with great opportunity for new advances that lie beyond its iconic simplifying assumptions. What, then, has changed since 1967? We can identify, somewhat simplistically, changes that have taken place for two different reasons. First, as shown in many of the chapters, there has been a great deal learned, through application and testing of the equilibrium model and its assumptions. This leads inevitably to recognition that the model is limited and imperfect, perhaps typified by Hanski's statement that \"... expectations regarding the MacArthur-Wilson model were too high ... and distracted attention from singlespecies incidence functions, which would have provided much richer material for research ...\" , and Holt's comments that MacArthur and Wilson's \"... island biogeography continues to provide a powerful metaphor for thinking about habitat fragmentation, ...
