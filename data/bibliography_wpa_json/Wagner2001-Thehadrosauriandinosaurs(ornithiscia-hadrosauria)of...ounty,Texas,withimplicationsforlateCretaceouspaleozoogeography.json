However, apart from a brief update of Davies' (1983) work (Wagner and Lehman, 1999) , no further research has been published on the hadrosaurian dinosaurs of Big Bend. Lehman (1987 Lehman ( , 1997 has summarized evidence for strong latitudinal floral and faunal differentiation along the western margin ofthe Late Cretaceous North American epeiric sea. Among Campanian dinosaur faunas, Lehman (1997) notes differences in both diversity and composition, with the hadrosaur fauna ofthe Judith River Group being much more diverse than that ofthe Fmitland Formation and Kirtland Shale in New Mexico and the Aguja Formation of Big Bend National Park. This conclusion was supported in part by Davies' research. Paleozoogeographic studies such as Lehman's are highly dependant on accurate systematic work. Fortunately, recent collecting activity conducted by crews from the University of Texas at Austin, Louisiana State University, and Texas Tech University have recovered more and better specimens. Significantly, where Davies had access to cranial material from at most three individuals (of which only a single maxilla, TMM 41917-1, was even remotely adequate), skull material is now available from four times as many individuals, spanning a size range from small individuals, probably juveniles, to extremely large adults. Significantly, this material now covers each ofthe three main terrestrial units of Late Cretaceous strata in the Park.

At Dawson Creek, a particularly large sill complex (right of center on the map in Figure 31 , Chapter 3) has altered a thick section of rock, and intmded at several different levels. At this locality, it is difficult to distinguish slightly metamorphosed sedimentary rock from igneous intmsive. In general, it was found that putative \"baked\" sediments were granular, brittle, and exhibit spheroidal (or \"onionpeel\") weathering, while igneous intmsives are smooth, texturally homogeneous, and break in an irregular, almost subconchoidal pattem. Altered rock sometimes crops out independent of any discemable intmsion., whereas, in some localities, there is only a very thin aureole of contact metamorphism next to an intmsion. This former phenomenon may be the result of alteration by hydrothermal fluids that penetrated the strata in advance of the main magma body. Examination of some \"intmsions\" mapped by other workers (unpublished) suggest that some of these are not intmsions, but isolated, slightly metamorphosed sandstone units. Lithostratigraphy Lehman (1985B) presented a model for the stratigraphy and nomenclature of Upper Cretaceous strata in the Big Bend region, largely as a refinement ofthe work of Maxwell et al.

Capping this unit is a locally thickened, laterally continuous sheet of sandstone, the Rattlesnake Mountain sandstone member ofthe Aguja Formation. This is interpreted to represent regressional sand shoal and estuarine facies. The Aguja Formation consists of volcanic arenites and mixed-layer smectite-illite claystone (Lehman, 1985B) . It contains abundant concretions, as well as Recent authigenic gypsum and iron oxides formed in the weathering zone. The iron oxides are locally formed into concretions and concretionary coatings around fossils.

Lehman (1985B) commented on the consequences ofthe supposed arbitrary nature of this boundary, and some specimens in the TMM collection have been incorrectly attributed to the Javelina Formation (Lehman pers. com.) . Color banding in the Javelina at sites observed by the author is not only stronger and more closely spaced, but is deeper in color than in the upper Aguja.

However, it seems likely that the lowest stratigraphic level at which the effects of such a restmcturing could be observed would be at the lower limit of channel erosion ofthe first major stream system to cut through the area after the onset ofthe new depositional regime. A pertinent analogy may drawn with the basal conglomerate ofthe Naashoibito Member ofthe Kirtland Shale (Lehman 1985 A) . Indeed, the sandstone below the base ofthe Javelina Formation (as described by Lehman [1985B] ) is, in some areas, of a distinct, very coarse lithology and contains inclusions of rock from the underlying portions ofthe Aguja (Lehman 1985B) .

These areas has not been sufficiently studied, and few fossils from this area were examined in the course of this study. However, these regions are important for the few useful specimens the have provided, and the regional geology is summarized briefly here. Although Lehman (1985B) did not extend the hthostratigraphic nomenclature he erected in the Sierra Vieja area into the Sierra Ojinaja region, he noted that several ofthe correlative units appeared to be present. However, a correlation by Lehman (1985B, Figure 3) suggests that only the lower sandstone member is present in the Sierra Ojinaja region. For the purposes of this discussion, his terminology will be apphed to both areas.",

Definitive ammonoid biostratigraphic work has not yet been performed in the area, although the reported presence of Baculites mclearni (Rowe et al, 1992; Sankey, 2001 ) in the basal sandstone member ofthe Aguja Formation suggests an approximate earliest Middle Campanian (Obradovich,1993) age for that member. Whether the lower shale fauna is equivalent to that ofthe upper shale member, or represents a distinct earlier stage in the regional fauna, can only be addressed by further work. However, Lehman (1985B) has noted differences in the faunas ofthe Rattlesnake Mountain sandstone and Terlingua Creek sandstone members, and the one dinosaur identified from the lower shale member, Kritosaurus sp. nov., is not known from the upper shale member. Rowe et al. (1992) , Sankey (1998 Sankey ( , 2001 , and Cifelh (1994) report on mammals from the lower portion ofthe upper shale member ofthe Aguja Formation. All of these reports suggest a Judithian \"age\" (Middle Campanian) for the fauna ofthe upper shale member ofthe Aguja Formation, a conclusion also reached by Lehman (1985) . Although there is no evidence for a discrete Edmontonian (Late Campanian-Early Maastrichtian) interval in the Big Bend sequence, it is possible that strata of that \"age\" are incorporated in the upper portion ofthe upper shale member.

By comparing skeletal transport groups (Voorhies, 1969) , Lehman (1982) concludes that the WPA 1 site is characterized by predominantly autochthonous ceratopsian remains and allocthonous hadrosaur remains, while the WPA 3 site shows the reverse. Indeed, there appears to be a wide spectrum among these bonebed assemblages, with some (WPA 1 and 2) being dominated by autochthonous material, and some (TMM 43682, see below) by allochthonous material. Presumably this range reflects the preservation of different stages of more \"upstream\" and \"downstream\" assemblages progressively winnowed by current action. More upstream localities {e.g., WPA 3) probably received a slow accumulation of more complete corpses, which were winnowed over time. Further downstream, the winnowed portions of upstream animals mingled with local elements {e.g.. WPA 1), while some localities (TMM 43682) seem to consist mostly of winnowed elements, and may represent similar deposits without the introduction of locally-derived corpses.",

Other evidence of tidal influence is generally lacking (Lehman, 1985B) , and the accepted interpretation ofthe Javelina as representing far inland deposits would seem to fiuther erode the case for a tidal origin of these structures.",

It is possible that rainfall, and therefore stream discharge, alternated seasonally or on a longer basis in the region; these periods were perhaps manifested as times of frequent flashflood activity. The resulting stochastic alternation between high floodstage flow and low, calm flow, could have easily produced the structure observed ( Figure 19 ).",

Several hadrosaur specimens from Big Bend show what appears to be unusually complete preservation ofthe pes or both the pes and manus. This would generally be interpreted as indicating subaerial disarticulation (Hill, 1979; Toots, 1965; WeigeU, 1927) .

Assemblages ofthe former type will have a high proportion of elements resistant to transport, relative to the latter type. Lehman (1982) proposed that the comparison ofthe number of vertebrae and ribs in a ceratopsian or hadrosaur deposit might be compared with the number of other elements to assess the degree of transport ofthe specimen. In the case of hadrosaurs, it seems clear that this measure must be modified, as hadrosaur skull bones appear to be very easily transported.

Unlike ceratopsians, hadrosaurs have a considerable caudal skeleton; the proportion is approximately 60% as calculated by Lehman. As calculated above, the proportion of ribs and vertebrae to remaming skeletal elements in hadrosaurs is closer to 70%. However, the resulting index ( Figure 20) illustrates relationships similar to those proposed here, suggesting that it may nonetheless be a useful statistic. The baseline for comparison should be ahered to around a 70% vertebrae and rib fraction for hadrosaurs, as show n in Figure 20 .",

Hypothetical representation groups for hadrosaurs, based on the sample from Big Bend and the literature, are presented in Table   1 . Authors (Dodson ,1971; Langston, 1976; Lehman, 1982) have pointed out that the effect of incomplete disarticulation on the representation of faunal elements cannot be stressed sufficiently. The hadrosaur metacarpus and metatarsus appear to be preserved more readily than would otherwise be indicated. Caudal vertebrae appear to be more resistant to transport than other vertebrae due to their size. Additionally, in life they were bound by a lattice of ossified tendons, which appears to favor disarticulation into segments of several vertebrae (see Lehman, 1982; Davies, 1983) , and probably increased their resistance to transport. In many Alberta hadrosaurs, the tail is incompletely known, presumably because of progressive loss of distal elements (Hill, 1979; Shipman, 1981; Weigelt, 1989) . This may be a strong indication of locally differing taphonomic regimes.",

The hadrosaur neck was supported by strong nuchal ligaments, probably connecting altemate vertebrae, as in birds (Alexander, 1989) , and not was connected to the \"withers\" (which is not present in all hadrosaurs) as reconstmcted by Paul (1997) after the pattem in ungulates. Evidence for such powerful ligaments is present in the extreme recurvature ofthe neck in articulated hadrosaur skeletons, which curvature appears to sometimes extend onto the dorsum and distort the ventral flexure ofthe back (the classic dinosaurian death pose, e.g., specimens illustrated in Parks, 1920; 1924) .

This indicates that the skull sometimes remained articulated as a unit during transport. Such sites usually yield a small quantity of bone from representation group II (Table 1) . Presumably, a whole skull, at least a non-lambeosaurine skull, would belong to that representation group. Lehman (1982) observed that the ceratopsian cranium apparently exhibited taphonomic behavior different from that of mammal skulls, in that it commonly disarticulated prior to burial. Thus, the skull was not transported as a single unit, as in mammals. This is also tme of hadrosaurs, which lacked the large, tightly integrated cranial elements of ceratopsians. The preponderance of articulated hadrosaur skulls in the famous latest Cretaceous hadrosaur-bearing strata of northem North America appears to be an artifact of special preservation, and is not characteristic of other regions. Table 1 also presents a tabulation of representation groups ofhadrosaur cranial elements, which are numbered so as to be approximately equivalent to the representation groups for postcrania.",

Physical attempts to fit ischium UTEP P.37.7.220 to ilium UTEP P.37.7.222 proved equivocal; it is possible that the bones do not fit properly, although the size ofthe elements, their state of preservation, and the possibility of a cartilaginous pad at the joint prevent a definitive statement on the matter. Davies' own calculations show the ilium to be much shorter than expected for an up-scaled Kritosaurus notabilis (= K incurvimanus), as well as much wider. Also, these comparisons were made with a specimen that appears to have a short ilium relative to other specimens of Kritosaurus. Davies (1983) suggests that a quarry photograph {ibid., Plate I.l, Figure 36 of this study) may indicate that ilium UTEP P.37.7.222 was found closely associated with another ilium (now lost), and possibly the ischia recovered at the site. However, this photo shows WPA workers standing on the quarry floor, \"preparing [the bones] for plastering,\" according to the quoted caption. The arrangement ofthe bones suggests that they had been recognized as similar elements, but little can be said about morphological similarities, since no details can be made out. There is no compelling ev idence to associate ihum UTEP P.37.7.222 widi the remainder ofthe postcrania.",

One would expect a sacrum freed from its ilia to have hydrodynamic properties similar to the linked caudal vertebrae found at the site (Davies, 1983) . Ilia themselves would have peculiar hydrodynamic properties, presumably much different from the remaining elements in the assemblage, which are all less plate-like. TMM 42309 contains two left ilia of nearly the same size, as well as three ischia, caudal vertebrae, haemal arches, and a rib.

There appears to be no reason to dispute their association, and this is tentatively accepted. This assessment is also supported by information on the Works Progress Administration excavations themselves. Quarrying at site WPAl was abandoned when the excavation reached a point where the overburden was too deep to continue, and WPA2 was closed when bone ceased to be found, but WPA3 was abandoned when the project was terminated (Davies, 1983) . The collection from WPA 3 then does not necessarily represent the complete deposit, and the hypothesis that nearly all ofthe material corresponds to a single animal relies on negative evidence, the absence of extensive material from another animal. -25, 39, 40, 41, 42 Discussion.-The presence of thick concretionary coverings on nearly all bones greatly complicates identifications. Table 3 represents a best approximation ofthe recovered elements from this site. The table is somewhat misleading, in that some elements are represented only by fragments, and some numbers are minima based on a number of fragmentary specimens. Since collection was concentrated in the area from which the maxillae were recovered, the site was unevenly sampled. Elements ofthe smaller hadrosaur were undoubtedly left uncollected.",

These cracks often penetrate the surrounding diagenetic concretion. Bones ofthe smaller hadrosaur exhibit a ropey or \"woven\" texture similar to that described by Behrensmeyer (1978) as \"type 3\" weathering. However, the areas which show this are mostly around the neural arches of vertebrae. Hadrosaur neural arches observed at this locality and others {e.g., TMM 41442) characteristically show a \"woven\", remodeled texture. It seems likely that the thin cortical bone ofthe specimens was completely removed as the concretionary coating spalled off, a commonly observed phenomenon at the site, resulting in the exposure ofthe tme bone texture below.",

Some extraneous bone fragments were located at the site, and appear to confirm that the pit was indeed fossiliferous at one point. Since Brown's notes were not consulted, and the specimen has not yet been examined, little more can be said. It is possible that this site represents a levee deposit, although it would be one ofthe lowest, stratigraphically. Discussion.- Davies (1983) presented stratigraphic columns of this locality (reproduced here as Figure 46 ). Although he suggested that the two columns were at different heights in the section, in this area (adjacent to the San Vicente study area) very little ofthe Aguja Formation is exposed above the Terlingua Creek Sandstone Member. It seems most likely that this site is in the Terlingua Creek Sandstone itself, or just above it.",

Ideally, this should give an idea of whether the assemblage has been altered more by the action of currents (\"winnowed\") or is the result of transport (\"transported\"). Note that this cannot give an indication of the total degree of alteration, a measure which can only be derived from the percent recovery of expected elements for each individual (see Lehman, 1982) . The dotted line represents the original proportion of each class of element. The counts have been modified from the formula of Lehman {ibid.) for hadrosaurs by the inclusion of skull elements in the count of vertebrae and ribs (see text). Note that counts represent minimum estimates for both categories, and the WPA 1 ceratopsian count is calculated as per Lehman {ibid.), unmodified.

In most published phylogenies {e.g., Godefroit et al, 1998; , the recognized content of Hadrosauroidea will not change beyond the exclusion of Ouranosaurus (which is usually taken as an outgroup anyway), as many non-hadrosauroid hadrosaurs are poorly studied.

As will be discussed in a later report, this condition probably not be evaluated in Telmatosaurus transsylvanicus. Casanovas-Cladellas et al (1999) considered the Fontllonga hadrosaur (here considered to belong to the species described by Company et al. [1998] ) closer to Hadrosauridae than either of these species based on the lack of secondary ridges supporting the marginal denticles, and the unrecurved nature ofthe teeth. Of hadrosauroids, Telmatosaurus transsylvanicus is the only species documented to have tmly recurved teeth. The teeth of Bactrosaurus appear to be very slightly recurved at the tip, but the primary carina ofthe enameled face often gives this appearance due to the dorsolateral curvature ofthe crown. Further, pubhshed illustrations (Gilmore, 1931; Godefroit et al, 1998) suggest that this character is variable through the dental series, with proximal mandibular tooth crowns being somewhat more recurved than distal ones (see also Company et al, 1998, Figure 4 ). The lack of ridges supporting the denticles in teeth ofthe Fontllonga hadrosaur may be an autapomorphy of that animal, highlighting the disutility of a limited dataset such as that employed by Casanovas et al (1999) . The unusual pattem of ornamentation in Lophorothon atopus (Langston, 1960) suggests that they may have denticle-supporting ridges, although a conclusive statement must await the results of fiirther study (Lamb, 1998 thickened and squared-off lateral emargination of ectopterygoid shelf; ectopterygoid shelf angled laterally less than 45 degrees to the horizontal; union of edge of maxillary ectopterygoid shelf and jugal process, with consequent loss of \"tunnel\" at rostral end of coronoid fossa and development of ventral \"spur\" on maxillary process of jugal; ?loss of slight recurvature in dentary teeth (partly after Casanovas-Cladellas et al, 1999 , Godefroit et al, 1998 Weishampel et al, 1993) . Discussion.-It is possible that an additional synapomorphy of this clade is extreme dorsolateral torsion ofthe postacetabular process ofthe ilium. This is seen in Gilmoreosaurus mongoliensis and the type of Secemosaurus koemeri, but is apparently lost in other members ofthe group. This is, however, a commonly distorted element {e.g., Carpenter, 2000; Morris, 1978) , and so this character was not included here. It is also possible that Gilmoreosaurus mongoliensis and Probactrosaurus gobiensis form an exclusive group, given similarities noted by Rozhdestvensky (1967 (Bonaparte, Franchi, Powell, et Sepulveda. 1984) Diagnosis.-Development of nasopremaxillary crest extending outside ofthe ancestral facial profile (convergent in Ouranosaurus nigeriensis); migration of circumnarial stmcture (expressed as a fossa initially) caudal to the narial foramen and lateral to the original lateral wall ofthe nasal cavity; tongue-in-grove portion of premaxillary-maxillary articulation migrates dorsally from base of rostroventral \"process\" to the level of the lacrimal articulation; depression of dentary symphysis well below ventral margin of dentary; loss of secondary ridges on dentary teeth; reduction in ischial diameter from approximately 1/12 ischial length to 1/20 ischial length and severe reduction of ischial \"boot\" to a small distal knob-like swelling; preacetabular process of ilium directed more ventrally (not in Claosaurus agilis); postacetabular process of ilium with parallel dorsal and ventral borders; development of bulge on cranial face ofthe distal end ofthe femur (partly after Godefroit et al, 1998; Sereno, 1999B; Weishampel et al, 1993) .",

However, as noted by those authors, the described material is indistinguishable from Secemosaurus koemeri Brett-Surman 1979 (Bonaparte et al, 1984) , except in the ilium. However, the ilium ofthe latter taxon is deformed {ibid.), and photographs ofthe ilium of \"K australis \" (Rich and Rich 1999) suggest that torsion of the postacetabular process, and deformation ofthe antitrochanter, in an ihum of that taxon might easily produce a morphology similar to that observed in S. koerneri. Bonaparte and Rougier (1997) agree in this conclusion. As \"Kritosaurus\" australis was recovered from localities in close geographical and temporal proximity, it seems best to consider it a species of Secemosaurus. However, as a temporal separation of 5. koerneri and S. australis has been hypothesized (Case et al, 2000) , it seems best to preserve these as separate species for the present, despite the absence of a morphological distinction in the material presently available.",

Similar too is the presence of only one set of replacement teeth in the maxilla (Bonaparte et al, 1984; Lamb, 1998) , which represents a reversal to the ancestral pre-hadrosaurian condition. The short preacetabular process ofthe ilium is reminiscent of a similar, but more pronounced, condition in Claosaurus agilis (Carpenter et al, 1995) , and stands in stark contrast to the condition in Kritosaurus. Illustrations of skull roofs of \"K. \" australis (Bonaparte, 1996, reproduced in Bonaparte and Rougier, 1997) show that this species probably possessed a nasofrontal fontanelle, a retained ancestral feature present in Aralosaurus tuberiferus (Rozhdestvensky, 1968) ,",

While superfamilial taxa were generally not added rapidly, at least among the vertebrates, the mandatory nature of family-rank assignment has created a great interest in that rank. Since rank is based on normative evaluation of difference, families swell and whither with the tide of new discovery. Often, the original \"concept\" ofthe group is based upon the characteristics of a commonly recovered elements {e.g., the femur), and a newly discovered species with a similar element was included with the assumption that differences in other parts ofthe skeleton are simply not of significance at the \"familial\" level. On the other hand, a new form of that element could spawn another family instantly. In the mean-time, each taxon would fill with forms, and its \"original\" content might change dramatically. It is an artifact of conservative taxonomy to refer new taxa to an established family rather than constmct a new one.",

Indeed, the difference in that bone is so slight as to be almost imperceptible in cranial view, and, were one not told the outlines of Davies (1983) were of different bones, one might readily believe they were the same bone viewed from slightly different angles. Davies' (1983) comparison ofthe metatarsals of these animals is complicated by the fact that he compares metatarsal III of Kritosaurus notabilis with an isolated metatarsal IV attributed to Hadrosaurus foulkii (Leidy, 1865) . The latter bone agrees well with metatarsal IV of Kritosaurus.",

From illustrations and photos, the dorsal margin appears cmshed, obscuring the development ofthe overhanging rim and bending the (well developed) antitrochanter dorsally. Although heavily restored, the base ofthe preacetabular process appears to have been flattened somewhat, exaggerating differences relative to Kritosaurus in the shape of the embayment dorsal to the pubic peduncle. While the dorsal margin ofthe caudal process (which is thickened and less subject to distortion) is angled dorsally as in Kritosaurus and non-hadrosaurids, fragments ofthe ventral margin have been reassembled to form a strange shape which more closely resembles the more horizontal postacetabular process of non-Kritosaurus hadrosaurids. From illustrations (Leidy, 1865) , this reconstmction appears dubious. Further, it creates a ventral inflection or pendant ventral knob unknown in other hadrosaurs. Waterhouse Hawkins' cast reconstmction of Hadrosaurus foulkii shows a smooth ventral margin (Lull and Wright, 1942) , suggesting that he too lacked confidence in this aspect of Leidy's reconstmction (although Waterhouse Hawkins' interpretation is rather novel, being placed backwards on the opposite side ofthe \"animal\").

Consensus of phylogenetic hypotheses presented by all current workers (e.g., Norman, 1990b; Weishampel et al, 1993; Godefroit et al, 1998; Head, 1999 ) places a number of taxa {e.g., Bactrosaurus johnsoni, Protohadros byrdi, Telmatosaurus transylvanicus) closer to hadrosaurids.

Although there is variation in the size and placement of these foramina, even on different sides ofthe skull, the variation noted here appears to be consistent. It is worth noting, however, Davies' (1983) observation that these foramina are often cmshed closed or not prepared or illustrated, making evaluation of variation in their pattems somewhat problematic. It is also worth noting that foramen II in species of Saurolophus (Brown 1912B, 1916A) is enlarged, and is set in a fossa. In some illustrations it appears to be two foramina (II and III?). This condition, however, appears to be distinct from that observed in Big Bend and San Juan Basin specimens, and the lack of similar morphology in Brachylophosaurus peeblesorum (UCMP 177303 et al, cast of OTM F138), Edmontosaurus regalis (Lambe 1920) , and Lambeosaurinae (Davies pers. notes) suggests that this feature is convergent.",

In contrast, the nasal arch is \"laid\" caudally against the \"brow\" ofthe skull in adult \"male\" K. notabilis and especially K navajovius, in which this condition is present even in an apparently subadult, possibly female specimen (NMMNH P-16106) . This difference is difficult to quantify, especially given the absence of complete specimens of either ofthe former two taxa. However, the (apparently) easier transition from the more rostrally placed arch in K latidens and K. sp. nov. to the long ancestral, nearly straight nasals of forms such as Iguanodon bernissartensis (Norman, 1980) , Bactrosaurus johnsoni (Godefroit et al, 1998) , and Gilmoreosaurus mongoliensis (Weishampel and Homer, 1986) suggests that this is the ancestral condition (Figures 57 and 58 ). On the other hand, Lophorothon atopus has a nasal crest set close to the \"brow\" ofthe skull (Langston, 1960) , and a similar crest has been restored for a mounted reconstmction of Secemosaurus australis (Anonymous, 1998 characterized the genus for nearly a century. K notabilis is known from many complete and well preserved specimens, few of which have been described in any detail. However, Parks' (1923) study remains a comerstone ofhadrosaur osteology, and has made the species a pivotal part of our understanding of hadrosaurs. It has previously been synonymized with K. navajovius by Brett-Surman (1988) and Hunt and Lucas (1992) , although, at the time, the latter species was very poorly known. Differences in the nasal arch, maxilla, and prepubic process ofthe pubis readily separate these species; sample size (in the latter species) is too small to confirm other reported differences (Davies 1983 ). Parks (1920) named Kritosaurus incurvimanus on the basis of ROM 4514, a superbly preserved skeleton, including a partial skull, from the Judith River Group of Alberta. Although this species has been widely accepted by many authors {e.g., Carrano et al, 1999; Homer, 1992; Lull and Wright, 1942; Pinna, 1979; Weishampel and Homer, 1990 ), others (Hopson, 1975; Davies, 1983; Brett-Surman, 1988 ) have suggested that it may represent a sexual dimorph ofK. notabilis.",

The smaller size is easily attributed to the skeleton belonging to a younger animal, and the shape ofthe orbit may be due to this as well. Further, the distinctive \"knotted brow\" shape ofthe orbit in other Kritosaurus specimens is partially due to the abmpt inward flexure ofthe bones surrounding the orbital foramen immediately medial to the orbital fenestra itself Specimens in which this intemal emargination is not exposed due to incomplete preparation (ROM 4514), or is obscured through distortion (MNHM v345) have much less \"stem\" countenance.",

The degree to which the caudodorsal margin ofthe narial foramen is \"u-shaped\" is considered of particular importance by Homer {ibid.), who suggests that this region is more \"v-shaped\" in \"Gryposaurus \" notabilis (and Kritosaurus navajovius). However, other examples of Kritosaurus notabilis have more \"u-shaped\" caudodorsal margins ofthe narial foramen (e.g.. Pinna, 1979; Weishampel and Homer, 1990) , and this distinction appears highly dependant upon the degree to which the crest is drawn dorsocaudally along the facial profile. Homer (1992) points out that the humems is more \"robust\" in Kritosaurus incurvimanus and \"Gryposaurus latidens \" than in Kritosaurus notabilis (specifically AMNH 5350). Examination of illustrations shows that, at least in the case of ROM 4514, AMNH 5350, and MNHM v345, the intrinsic proportions ofthe humems are not significantly different, allowing for a presumed increase in the diameter ofthe condyles and the degree to which the deUopectoral crest is developed relative to length. Thus, in comparison to the common observation that the lambeosaurine humems is robust, in that is possesses broad distal condyles and a thickened shaft relative to length {e.g., Weishampel and Homer, 1990) , this statement does not hold.",

This gives the femora a distinctly nonhadrosaurian sigmoid curve in lateral view.

With the information available at the time, these conclusions were more than justified. However, comparison of prepubic processes shows that this pubis is much more similar to that of Kritosaurus cf. K navajovius described here (see Figure 87 ). The dorsal margin ofthe blade ofthe prepubis is roughly parallel to the dorsal margin ofthe shaft, unlike in Edmontosaurus (where it is ventrally deflected), and the shaft is proportionally shorter than that of Edmontosaurus copei (in which it is, admittedly, rather long for Edmontosaurus Weishampel and Homer [1990] , being an \"edmontosaur\").

The type of this species is a set of vertebrae, probably from the Navesink Formation (Colbert, 1948) , belonging to at least three different animals (Marsh, 1870) . Lull and Wright (1942) point out proportional differences between one ofthe Hadrosaurus minor dorsals and two dorsals of Hadrosaurus foulkii. However, while the vertebrae ofthe latter taxon are cranial dorsals, the described dorsal of Hadrosaurus minor is likely from the caudal part ofthe series (based on its proportions). Diagnostic features ofhadrosaur vertebral centra have not been documented, and the specimen is therefore morphologically indeterminate. Colbert (1948) felt justified in referring his specimen to Hadrosaurus minor on the grounds ofthe small size of both the latter, which he felt distinguished it from other fragmentary species in region: Hadrosaurus cavatus Cope 1871, a nomen dubium based on four caudal vertebrae also probably from the Navesink Formation (Colbert, 1948) , was thought by Colbert to represent a different, larger species. Ornithotarsus immanis, of unknown stratigraphic provenance (possibly from the Woodbury Clay [Colbert, 1948] ), is a large distal epipodium with a (presumably pathological) coossified astragalus and calcaneum. The observed size difference in these forms is an unlikely basis for a specific distinction, especially considering recent finds of hadrosaurian remains over a broad size range in marine strata of New Jersey (Gallagher, 1995) .",

The poorly known \"species\" named above should be consigned to the taxonomic wastebasket, although they will remain a valid and important part ofthe record of hadrosaurs in New Jersey. Homer (1992) placed Brachylophosaurus (including \"Maiasaura \") outside of a clade consisting of other \"hadrosaurines\" (hadrosaurids in his scheme), including Kritosaurus. Many ofthe characters used to support this assignment are reconsidered here. Some need to be reconsidered in light of a more conventional outgroup; Homer's {ibid.) analysis was influenced by his adoption of Iguanodon as a referential \"outgroup,\" and early hadrosaurs which more likely approximate the ancestral morphology for \"hadrosaurines\" were not directly considered.",

Discussion.-Brachylophosaurus canadiensis has long been considered a close relative of Kritosaurus, due to its alleged \"arched\" nasals. Examination of photographs of the type (Stemberg, 1953) as well as referred specimens shows that the nasals ofthe type, and indeed most ofthe skull, is slightly disarticulated. Proper articulation shows that the snout, while somewhat deep, is smoothly and shallowly tapered rostrally. The nasal is somewhat more curved than in ancestral taxa, but is in no way recurved as it is in Kritosaurus (see Figure 61) . A new restoration of Brachylophosaurus peeblesorum (based on UCMP cast of OTM F138) shows that the two species of Brachylophosaurus are very similar in overall head form ( Figure 61 ), and are distinct from Kritosaurus. This restoration is confirmed by a new \"Maiasaura\" skull at the ROM, which was cmshed laterally rather than the dorsoventral cmshing ofthe type and the oblique cmshing of OTM F138. Even without such new information, the numerous derived characters listed above support the hypothesized close relationship between these two species, as originally argued by Homer (1992) . Homer (1982 Homer ( , 1983 ) has emphasized the \"primitive\" nature ofthe cranium of Maiasaura, without considering non-hadrosaurid hadrosaurs such as Bactrosaurus johnsoni, and Gilmoreosaurus mongoliensis. This assertion is based on the Iguanodonlike rostrum (the result of severe cmshing) interpreted for the type specimen, as well as confiision surrounding the crest and circumnarial fossa. Trexler (1995) insists that there is no \"nasal crest\" on Brachylophosaurus peeblesorum. Yet, the nasals clearly participate in the \"interorbital crest\" of this species, and the latter does clearly constitute a departure from the skull profile. That it does not closely resemble the crests of some other hadrosaurids is consistent with the hypothesis that these crests were instrumental in premating isolation ofthe various hadrosaurid species (Hopson, 1975 ).",

The prefrontal is illustrated in its cmshed orientation, rather than in life position. In life it would have been inclined dorsolaterally, and the broad fossa visible on its dorsal surface in photographs would be continuous with the circumnarial fossa. Since only the prefrontal ofthe type is illustrated, it is impossible to determine the situation in an adult ofthe putative species. The lateral margin ofthe circumnarial fossa illustrated on adult nasals (Homer, 1993 , plate 29 A and B) appear to show the exclusion ofthe prefrontal from the fossa. However, this ridge is very similar in morphology to that observed in Saurolophus maximus (Brown, 1916A) , and without a prefrontal there is no support for this character. Thus, \"Prosaurolophus \" blackfeetensis is not distinct, and is here considered a junior synonym of Saurolophus maximus. Discussion.-The included taxa may represent the same species, as they are tmly separated only by the shape ofthe crest, which varies with growth in S. angustirostris (Rozhdestvensky, 1965; Maryanska and Osmolska, 1981A) . Although the frontals are not proven to participate in the development ofthe crest in S. osborni (Lull and Wright 1941 ), this putative difference should be investigated fiirther, as should the reported presence of bony septa within the circumnarial fossa ofthe Mongolian form (Maryanska and Osmolska, 1979; . It seems best to regard these forms as separate species, in that they are found in distinctly different faunas on different continents. However, they are so similar as to suggest that they were almost certainly contemporaneous {contra Jerzykiewicz and Russell, 1991) . Indeed, the difference between these species and Diagnosis.-Overall longer and wider circumnarial stmcture, giving a relatively wider \"beak\" and longer rostrum; relatively elongate prenarial portion of premaxilla.",

However, examination of illustrated specimens shows that the proportion ofthe length ofthe humeral shaft to the diameter across the distal condyles is less than 4 for Lambeosaurinae, and greater than 4 for all other hadrosaurs. This proportional difference appears to be consistent, and may constitute a better description ofthe \"robust\" humems of lambeosaurines. Occurrence. (Ostrom, 1967) , and the foraminal pattem ofthe maxilla is similar to that in Lambeosaurus, in that the caudal foramena are tightly wrapped around the jugal articulation (K. L. Davies, personal notes). The sagittal crest is indeed high, although it appears that cmshing has de-emphasized the prominence of this feature in specimens of Hypacrosaurus casuarius, Parasaurolophus walkeri and Lambeosaurus magnicristatus.",

Caudal to this flange, the maxillary body expands laterally, then forms into a shallow fossa rostral to the enlarged, round rostral maxillary foramen, termed foramen X here, which is characteristic of hadrosaurs (and was homologized by Weishampel [1984] with the antorbital fenestra). Maxillary foramen X is oriented such that the soft tissues communicating through it would pass through the fossa and under the ventrolateral process ofthe premaxilla. This foramen is situated ventral to an arcuate flange (the lacrimal flange of Homer [1990] ) lateral to a groove which passes in tum along the lateral side ofthe dorsal process. The slot-shaped articulation between the rostrodorsal process and the flange is aligned with the rostroventral process, and represents the dorsal articulation ofthe premaxilla with the maxilla.

Two distinct functional units are present. A medially placed dorsal tubercle (above) is situated immediately ventral to the caudal limit ofthe dorsal process. This tubercle is contiguous with a dorso-laterally angled planar extension ofthe \"lacrimal\" flange, and may be homologous with the dorsal ofthe two tubercles identified by Head (1998) on the maxilla of Protohadros, (and also present in Bactrosaurus [Godefroit et al, 1998; J.

Lateroventral to this tubercle, contiguous with the edge ofthe ectopterygoid shelf, is a squared off protmsion, which is possibly homologous to the ventral ofthe two tubercles mentioned above. This prominence probably represents the ancestral iguanodonfian jugal process, although the nature ofthe articulation with the jugal has changed substantially. On the caudoventral comer ofthe lateral side of the jugal process is a very shallow socket for a peg on the rostral process of the jugal. This peg-and-socket joint forms the extreme rostrodorsal limit ofthe coronoid fossa. Medially, on the caudal and dorsal surfaces of the jugal process, as well as on the more medial dorsal tubercle, the bone surface is roughened and striated for attachment of the jugal. Rostrally, the protmsion forms a small ridge mnning in a shallow arc, convex ventrorostrally, to the caudal limit ofthe \"lacrimal\" flange.

The degree of curvature is obscured by the incompleteness ofthe specimen, but it is clear that the ventral margin was curved for at least the rostral half of the bone. It is also clear that this curvature was overall less than that present in other species of Kritosaurus, although this is at least partially due to rearrangement ofthe symphysis. This stands in contrast to the morphology of Secemosaurus australis (Bonaparte et al, 1984 , Bonaparte, 1996 , Lophorothon atopus (TMM 42936-1, cast of AUMP 982, Figure 53) , and pre-Campanian hadrosaurs where the curvature is restricted to the very front of the jaw. Other hadrosaurs, {e.g., Brachylophosaurus peeblesorum [Homer, 1992] , Prosaurolophus maximus [ibid.]) are often illustrated as having pronounced ventral inflection in the dentary. However, this appears to be due to over-rotation ofthe dentaries along their long axes in situ, and in subsequent reconstmctions. In such a position, with the toothrow angled medially, the medially inclined base ofthe symphysial process may exaggerate the degree of curvature in the mandible. When articulated in the approximately correct position, the mandibles of Kritosaurus and Lambeosaurinae appear to curve gently from the rostral end ofthe toothrow such that the symphysial end is directed at least thirty degrees ventrally relati\\ e to the long axis ofthe bone.

This suggests that hadrosaurid teeth were not shed during feeding, and isolated occurrences ofhadrosaur teeth may result from post-mortem breakage of one of the jaw bones (see discussion of TMM 41917-1, below). Interestingly, reports of isolated hadrosaurid teeth from Big Bend examined for this study {e.g., , Davies, 1983; Sankey, 2001; Standhardt, 1986 ) involve a much greater number of maxillary teeth than dentary teeth.

The long symphysial process ofthe dentary, nearly horizontal palatines, and broad nasals all suggest that this animal was broad snouted (see Figure 68) . The dentaries and then two symphysial processes would have met in a w-shaped section rostrally, which would have supported a predentary shaped like two trowels laid side to side. The raised symphysis probably led to a raised ridge which passed between the concave predentary fossae dorsally, much like the strengthening ridge leading from the handle onto the blade of a spade or shovel. As in other predentaries (in which there is only a single fossa), the two fossae would have shallowed rostrally. The lateral edges would have curved slightly medially, and then formed a thickened edge which would meet the raised ridge in the centerline, forming a flat leading edge. This leading edge may have been coarsely denticulate, as in some non-hadrosaurid hadrosaurs. The rostral extension ofthe symphysial processes, and the general proportions ofthe dentaries, suggests that the predentary was longer than normal, possibly having the horizontal dimensions of a normal hadrosaurs with a jaw as wide. Since, in hadrosaurs, the rostroventral process of the maxilla is at a very acute angle to the inclination ofthe premaxilla, it would seem that TMM 42452-1 had a shallowly dipping premaxillary rostrum relative to other Kritosaurus. The steep maxillary articular surface ofthe premaxilla may then indicate the caudolateral process ofthe premaxilla was rostrocaudally thicker than in other members ofthe genus, and thickened ventrally.",

(Figure 69 ) cannot be explained as an extreme case of any of these trophic mechanisms. It appears probable that this animal was adapted to shoveling out and scooping up vegetation. The dentary symphysis was raised medially, producing a central reinforcing ridge, from which the two halves ofthe bone could form strong arches to take the strain of pushing through sediment or vegetation . The dentary was straightened in order to bring the predentary into alignment with the axis ofthe mandibles, reducing bending stress along the length ofthe bone and keeping material from falling out ofthe predentary. The widening ofthe mandible, and corresponding widening ofthe cranium, produced a wider \"scoop,\" while the less rostroventrally inclined rostrodorsal processes ofthe maxilla articulated with a longer premaxilla sporting a less depressed beak margin. Force for shoveling was probably provided by the neck muscles. It is even possible that the underdeveloped hyoid indicates a less flexible tongue; it is possible that a \"shoveling\" method of acquiring food required less tongue use in bringing the food from the rostrum into the buccal area at the back ofthe mouth.",

As mentioned above, although the rostra of hadrosaurs differ greatly among species, the pattem of variation does not indicate one unique cause. Interpretations of trophic specialization do not generally take into account possible phylogenetic, or behavioral explanations for the stmcture ofthe hadrosaur snout. Carrano et al (1999) sought to demonstrate that hadrosaurids were habitat partitioned on the basis of their dental, muzzle, and hindlimb statistics. Their study is potentially weakened by their lumping of animals from different times and regions, the possibility that the \"hadrosaurines\" they coded together may not form a monophyletic group, underrepresentation of certain forms (e.g. Kritosaurus), and possibly inadequate accounting for allometric trends in limb proportions. However, most clear was the failure to account for other explanations for the data. As noted above, the stmcture ofthe lambeosaurine crest akers the stmcture, and perhaps even homology ofthe proportions of the snout. Further, some hadrosaurids appear to show a different allometric trend in forelimb development (Table 5 , Figure 59 ), and the presence of a pronounced \"withers\" above the forelimb girdle in saurolophids (but only obvious in lambeosaurines due to the apomorphic reduction ofthe neural spines in saurolophines) suggests that they may have pursued a different locomotor regime.",

Ventral to the head, the rostral edge curves rostroventrally as a wing-shaped edge which contacts the squamosal rostrodorsally. The contact area is abraded, but appears to preserve a shallow groove for the squamosal as on TMM 42452-1. The convex rostral margin then tapers caudoventrally to the rostrally concave quadratojugal facet. It reaches an abmpt point at the ventral extremity of this facet, then angles caudoventrally to the mandibular condyle.",

Along the edges ofthe ridges, relatively large, regularly spaced papillae are oriented en echelon toward the tip ofthe tooth, while smaller, more subtle and irregularly spaced papillae omament the lingual surface ofthe ridge. There is a hint of regular omamentation on the carina, although this may be the result of abrasion. The less well-preserved crown from TMM 42880 more closely resembles TMM 42876 in the morphology ofthe papillae. Tooth TMM 42880 is nearly identical to MLP 98-1-10-1 from Antarctica (Case et al, 2000) , especially m that both possess strong papillae, resulting in the appearance of serated edges.",

This appears to be the result of widespread reference to the mechanical illustrations in Parks (1920) . These show a thick preacetabular process, whereas the photograph ofthe specimen shows a thinner morphology. Also, the preacetabular process ofthe ROM specimen may be reconstmcted along its ventral edge, as it resembles that of Edmontosaurus far more than any other described Kritosaurus ilium. The full length ofthe process may not have been originally preserved. This would be in keeping with other hadrosaur ilia, including other Kritosaurus specimens, in which the preacetabular process is broken at or around the prominant ventral flange. It is somewhat uncertain whether there existed a considerable length ofthe bone past this flange (as is present ancestrally) or not (as in other hadrosaurids).

The neck constricts rostrally for some 1.5 times the diameter ofthe acetabulum, then expands, more so ventrally than dorsally, to form the distal \"paddle.\" The dorsal margin expands in a shallow curve to a subtle inflection point (observed on most other hadrosaur prepubes), then straightens slopes very slightly cranioventrally. The ventral. The paddle is not strongly downtumed along its ventral edge as in Kritosaurus notabilis, as noted by Davies (1983) . However, it does appear to preserve some partial deflection, and in even a conservative restoration it appears as K notabilis prepubis that has simply been \"unflexed.\" Davies (1983) commented on the Brett-Surman's identification of ventral deflection ofthe prepubis as diagnostic of Kritosaurus, suggesting that this morphology appears in subadult Edmontosaurus regalis {E. \"edmontoni\") . Examination of published illustrations shows that deflection ofthe ventral margin ofthe prepubis occurs in many hadrosaurids, and is probably ancestral for the group. Deflection ofthe dorsal margin does seem to be present in illustrations of subadult E. regalis (Parks, 1935) , but this appears to be a case of postmortem damage or, perhaps, incomplete ossification ofthe element. In such cases, the blade expands distally, unlike the condition observed in Kritosaurus. In any case, Mateer's (1981) figure ofthe pubis of Kritosaurus navajovius shows a morphology nearly identical to that ofthe TMM 42309-3. Further, although Colbert's (1948) comparison ofthe prepubis of Hadrosaurus minor to that of Edmontosaurus copei shows some similarity, the former bone shows even more affinity for the pubis of TMM 42309-3 ( Figures 87 and 88) .",

Such contacts are found in ceratopsians (Lehman pers. com.) , and on TMM 42452-1. As Davies {ibid.) points out, the distribution of this feature may represent individual or sexual variation.

If one assumes that most ofthe preacetabular blade is restored, the remainder of the bone matches that of Prosaurolophus maximus quite well. In any case, if the great range of variation as separates UTEP P.37.7.222 and TMM 42309-2 is allowed within a genus, let alone a species, there is no hope of deriving any diagnostic information from any hadrosaurid ilium. UTEP P.37.7.222 is a large, robust bone, differing from TMM 42309-2 in its proportionally shorter and dorsoventtally thicker preacetabular process with a broader, much more pronounced venttal flange near the distal tip. Also of significance is the nearly horizontal orientation ofthe postacetabular process relative to the iliac and ischiadic peduncles. This is a derived feature seen in all hadrosaurids except Kritosaurus and possibly Hadrosaurus foulkii and Brachylophosaurus peeblesorum. The antittochanter, and the inflection ofthe dorsal margin ofthe ilium dorsal to it, is developed to a much greater degree in this specimen than in any specimen of Kritosaurus. The process is oriented laterally and shows a marked lip overhanging its base dorsally. The caudolateral margin ofthe antittochanter is damaged, which deemphasizes how prominent the process is.",

The postacetabular process is twisted at least thirty degrees to vertical about its long axis, such that it faces laterodorsally at its distal end. On its medial face, a low ridge is produced ventrally which then rises caudally to support the thickened dorsal edge ofthe process as in TMM 42452-1.

Averaging of these ratios shows that lambeosaurines composed only 27.5% ofthe total hadrosaur fauna (standard deviation 9%), which is significantly greater than the roughly 5% figure from the data of Lehman (1997) , and is comparable to the value for the better-studied Fmitland and Kirtland Formations (37% [Lehman, 1997; Wilhamson, 2000] ).

Although it is certainly possible that caudal vertebrae may be variable in proportion systematically among hadrosaurs, this has not yet been subjected to an appropriate test. Changes in proportions occur along the length ofthe vertebral series, and these changes do not always follow a single ttend (see below). The relationship of these changes to the size ofthe animal are unknown, and the possibihty of sexual dimorphism has not been addressed. Therefore, Davies' (1983) conclusions seem insufficiently supported, despite his attempt to isolate differences in vertebrae from approximately the same region ofthe tail. Further, since Barsboldia sickinskii appears to be a junior synonym of Tanius sinensis, a non-hadrosaurid (unpublished data), the taxonomic distribution and diagnostic significance ofthe reported proportional differences is questionable.",

The TMM 42534 specimen, which almost certainly is from a juvenile (being barely 8 cm in medio-lateral width), bears a prominent indentation between the inter-condylar portion and the medial articular surface. It is possible that this indentation represents a line of fusion (as in the ascending process of Dilophosaurus wetherelli [Welles, 1983] ),.

Note plesiomorphic ventral deflection of symphysis, in contrast to Kritosaurus sp. nov. were touched on during the execution of this project. Some of these are directly relevant to the description and interpretation ofthe data in the study, including details ofthe hadrosaurian manual skeleton, the paleozoogeographic distribution of hadrosaurs, hadrosaur body size, and the presence of juvenile hadrosaurs in lowland facies strata.

In Homer's (1979) specimen, the disc-shaped carpal bears a square articular facet on one side.

The ulnare of Camptosaurus dispar partly overlies the proximal end of metacarpal III. The block-like intermedium in Iguanodon caps metacarpal IE ahnost completely, and in Camptosaurus it covers portions of metacarpals II and III. Oddly, Taquet (1976) interprets the intermedium to have coossified with the ulnare and to occupy a position only slightly bordering even on metacarpal FV. It seems more likely that the intermedium forms part ofthe carpal block including the radiale, carpal 1, and metacarpal I, which partly overlies metacarpal III. Norman (1986) suggests that Taquet (1976) reversed the proximal and distal faces ofthe carpus of Ouranosaurus. If so, the carpus would broadly resemble that of Iguanodon to a greater extent. However, this would result in an unusual proximally-directed pollex, and does not account for the specimen's apparently correct pattem of articular facets on the \"distal surface\" identified by Taquet {ibid.) .",

If the trend toward increasing divergence ofthe pollex is continued, it could conceivably become tetrahedral. The well-developed distal articular facet may indicate that distal carpal II has been inextricably fused with the radiale. This identification is supported by the uncanny resemblance ofthe tetrahedral element to the radiale of Altirhinus kurzanovi (Norman, 1998) . One unanswered question would be why the apex of this element is oriented toward the extensor face ofthe manus in TMM 42452-1, but toward the flexor surface in Iguanodon.

Three ofthe species listed here {B. canadiensis, L. magnicristatus, and P. walkeri), are exceedingly rare (Russell, 1967; Dodson, 1975) , and it is possible that the Judith River Group samples the very edge of their former geographic range. However, the overall picture, as demonstrated by Lehman (1997) is of a high-diversity hadrosaur fauna dominated by lambeosaurines. In contrast, the upper shale member fauna ofthe Aguja sports only two species, with lambeosaurine specimens outnumbered by non-lambeosaurines. Earlier large omithopod faunas generally feature one or, at most, two species (Table 8) .",

However, the same observations apply to ceratopsian dinosaurs surprisingly well, with ceratopsian genera substituted for hadrosaur genera on a nearly one-to-one basis: Chasmosaurus ( Edmontosaurus. Given these relationships, nearly the same distributions apply, suggesting that there may be a common explanation for the high diversity of hadrosaurs and ceratopsians in the Judith River Group of Alberta. A logical prediction of this model would be that eventually centrosaurine ceratopsians will be found in inland facies strata correlative with the Aguja and Fmitland and Kirtland Formations.",

Juvenile material has been collected from the Grapevine Hills study area. Rattlesnake Mountain study area, and the Sierra Aguja Study area. Additionally, Standhardt (1986) reported teeth of juvenile hadrosaurs from the uppermost upper shale member ofthe Aguja in the Dawson Creek area, and Lehman (1982) reported some juvenile ceratopsian material from the Talley Mountain study area. Dodson (1971) , Carpenter (1982A) and Fiorillo (1987) have commented on the possibility that the observed lack of lowland juvenile dinosaurs may be artifactual. Homer (1982) described upland nesting sites for hadrosaurs, although the degree to which these represent a tmly \"upland\" depositional envfronment is open to question. Like the case for migration (Lehman, 1997) , clauns that hadrosaurs might have moved inland to breed are comphcated by the lack of conspecific hadrosaurs in upland \"nesting grounds\" and temporally correlative lowland facies. Indeed, hadrosaur distribution may have been at least partially controlled by environment (see above).",

The former is almost indistinguishable from broadly contemporaneous Kritosaurus navajovius from the San Juan Basin, New Mexico, but until better material is available, the species assignment must remain tentative. The Big Bend lambeosaurine is known from very little definitively identifiable material, mainly femora. An ilium assigned Kritosaurus cf K. navajovius by Davies (1983) may belong to this species. The only cranial material currently known for this animal is a damaged maxilla, which demonstrates that this animal is distinct from other hadrosaurs, but is insufficient to characterize a new species. Currently available material suggests that this species may be most closely related to Parasaurolophus walkeri. These two species occur in approximately the same proportions as Kritosaurus navajovius and Parasaurolophus walkeri in the San Juan Basin.",

Progradation occurred in a general west to east direction, and the unit thins eastward until only the basal sandstone member is identifiable. Overlying the Rattlesnake Mountain sandstone member (and in some westem locations, the basal sandstone member) is a wedge of marine prodeltaic and delta front mudstones and sandstone sheets termed the McKinney Springs tongue ofthe Pen Formation. This unit thins westward, and thickens to the east, where it merges with the body ofthe Pen Formation east ofthe furthest extent ofthe basal sandstone member ofthe Aguja Formation. The Terlingua Creek sandstone member ofthe Aguja Formation everywhere overlies the highest strata ofthe Pen Formation. In most areas these are within the McKinney Springs tongue; in the extreme eastem part ofthe park, the Terlingua Creek sandstone directly overlies the body ofthe Pen. The progradational Terlingua Creek sandstone member consists of laterally continuous sandstone bodies representing delta mouth bar, distributary charmel, and crevasse splay facies. The unit is present across the entire Park, representing the final retreat ofthe Cretaceous Interior Seaway from the Big Bend region. Above it lies the upper shale member ofthe Aguja Formation, a stacked series of mudstones and sandstone bodies representing interdistributary bay, coastal marsh and swamp, distributary charmel and coastal and inland floodplain facies, including fluvial channel and overbank deposits. The Terlingua Creek sandstone member/ upper shale member contact becomes increasingly arbitrary in the eastem portion of Big Bend National Park, as the deltaic sands ofthe former and coastal marsh and swamp facies clays and lignites ofthe latter intertongue extensively through a thick vertical section. The extreme variability in thickness and boundary inconsistencies associated with ofthe former unit observed by Bohannan (1987) appears to be due to the intimate association ofthe boundary-defining lithologies represented in the overall coastal sedimentary geometry.",

Occurrence.-Judith River Group of Alberta, Kaiparowitz Formation of Utah, Fmifland Formation and Kirtland Shale of New Mexico Age.-Late Campanian through Early MaastrichtianDiscussion.-The lateral fontanelle ofthe crest likely represents the ancestral narial foramen, and was probably enclosed by cartilage in life(Hopson, 1975, but seeMaryanska and Osmolska, 1979). The s-loop likely represents the path ofthe air passage around the premaxillary fossa. The loss of these two features is paralleled in Hypacrosaurus altispinus. Were it not for the discovery of additional cranial remains of H. laticaudus in Montana, a close relationship between H. altispinus and P. walkeri would probably be the most parsimonious hypothesis.Williamson (2000) recently summarized evidence suggesting that P.cyrtocristatus is a sexual dimorph of P. tubicen. He also pointed out {ibid.) that there is little basis for comparison ofthe intemal stmcture ofthe crest in P. tubicen, as interpreted byWilliamson and Sullivan (1999), with that of P. walkeri, weakening the latter authors' arguments for a specific distinction between the two forms. The images ofthe intemal stmcture ofthe crest in P. tubicen provided byWilliamson and Sullivan {ibid.)  are extremely difficult to interpret. The computed tomography (CT) sections {ibid., Appendix 3) reveal absolutely no intemal detail apart from what appears to be a network of ?calcite crystals infilling the tracts ofthe crest. The x-radiograph illustration {ibid.Figure 21) can be interpreted a number of ways, but the most obvious, made in comparison with the CT sections is that the additional septa reported by Sullivan and Williamson are manifestations of an intemal stmcture otherwise identical to that of P. walkeri which has been distorted by cmshing ofthe specimen. The impression of doubled ascending tracts appears to be the result of viewing the median septum recognized in P. walkeri by Parks",

There is no indication of a prolonged dorsal extension ofthe medial flange as a transversely-oriented, dorso-ventrally elongate plate as in Edmontosaurus and Brachylophosaurus (OTM F138). Near the end ofthe process, both flanges, and the groove between them, sweep caudally. The postorbital articulated along the groove, and by the shape and orientation ofthe postorbital process and the groove itself, probably slid along the articulation during mastication and the associated cranial kinesis. While this interpretation is in contrast with that of Weishampel (1984), casts of a disarticulated skull of Brachylophosaurus (OTM F138) and illustrations of other hadrosaurs suggests that this is the general case in hadrosaurids, if not in all iguanodontians. The inner surface ofthe distal portion ofthe flange of the jugal bows somewhat medially relative to the rest ofthe bone. This forms a shallow hillock on the medial surface, and a shallow fossa on the caudal portion ofthe lateral surface. The rostroventral margin ofthe flange is thickened and appears somewhat more prominently striated than the rest ofthe bone, possibly for the origin of buccal musculature. The extreme ventral margin ofthe flange is incomplete. The caudoventral portion ofthe flange forms a narrow, caudoventrally facing facet which may represent a muscular attachment scar.

This fossa opens onto the medial surface ofthe quadrate head dorsally, but widens and shallows ventrally until it bulges outward as the top ofthe mandibular condyle.Caudodorsallyalong the medial surface ofthe bone, the caudal edge ofthe shaft forms the rounded lateral margin of a broad fossa that covers the caudal face ofthe pterygoid process. Within this fossa, the edges ofthe articular facet for the pterygoid can be made out as two arcuate ridges, one oriented dorsally and somewhat laterally, the other is semicircular and concave ventromedially. These scars converge on a point near the center ofthe process. The fossa produced appears proportionally much deeper in the LSUMG V-1183. Lateral to this fossa, the caudal margin ofthe shaft is concave caudally in dorsal view, and the thick rounding ofthe caudal margin ofthe head is continued ventrally along the caudal margin ofthe shaft. However, as the fossa deepens ventrally, the caudal margin ofthe shaft becomes sharper and twists around the shaft to the caudomedial side. Here, this edge forms a sharp ridge which shghtly overlaps an elongate sulcus formed between it and the pterygoid process. This ridge becomes less pronounced ventrally, but continues to twist medially over the bulky ventral shaft to join with the small, tuberous medial extension ofthe mandibular condyle. Lateral to this ridge, the caudal edge ofthe lateral face ofthe quadrate forms a roimded comer which develops ventrally into a ridge and merges with the caudal extremity ofthe mandibular condyle. Between this and the medially twisting ridge is a very subtly roimded surface which gives way to a pronounced fossa ventrally, just dorsal to the point where the mandibular condyle joins with its medial tuberous extension. The lateral surface ofthe quadrate is very sUghtly concave dorsally, with a rounded, thickened convex edge around the rostrodorsal squamosal' Ving.\" Ventrally, the edge thickens again around the facet for the quadratojugal, becoming thickest at its most caudal extent. In this region, prominent striations on the surface ofthe bone radiate from the lateral surface caudal limit ofthe facet. These ridges are present not only outside the facet, but inside as well.",

YPM-PU 16970, from the Bearpaw Shale of Montana was originally referred to K notabilis byHomer (1979), who described it as having a crest extending above the orbits, although no explanation was made as to whether this means simply above the plane ofthe orbits or physically above them, and, in either case, to what extent. Homer later (1992) referred this specimen to Kritosaurus sp., the genus which, in his scheme, otherwise included only K. navajovius. In support of this he cites the caudal bifiircation ofthe nasals, the presence of a slight lateral ridge on the nasal crest, extension ofthe circumnarial fossa caudally past this ridge, and the nasals are \"wide... over the crest.\"",

Williamson (2000) gave a succinct summary of recent taxonomic litigation surrounding the validity ofthe type specimen. His conclusion, that Anasazisaurus horneri Hunt and Lucas 1993 and Naashoibitosaurus ostromi Hunt and Lucas 1993 are both junior synonyms ofK. navajovius {ibid.), is supported by a wealth of evidence, and is accepted here.The commonly cited feature ofthe type, in which the jugal and quadrate do not make contact (hence the generic epithet \"separated lizard\"[B. Creisler, pers. com.]), is likely a result ofthe articulation ofthe skull as mounted. As noted above, this area ofthe jaw is kinetic, and in photographs it is clear that the quadrate and mandible of this specimen are drawn back.

The consistency observed among most hadrosaurs suggests that, although the evidence is meager, this feature is taxonomically decisive. Further, the acetabular ridge ofthe pubis arches to the cranial end ofthe articular face ofthe iliac peduncle rather than toward the middle ofthe peduncle as in Brachylophosaurus and Saurolophidae. This is a retained plesiomorphy shared with Kritosaurus, Secemosaurus, Bactrosaurus and probably Gilmoreosaurus.
