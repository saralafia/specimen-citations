Hill, Phillips , and Udden published a map in 1904 that included the rocks of the Tomillo Group, but no text accompanied their map (Schiebout, 1987) . Udden (1907) conducted a more thorough geologic investigation, although he did not include a map in his publication. He designated the stratigraphic series of clay-dominated deposits above the Rattlesnake Beds (now the Aguja formation) as the Tomillo Clays, to which he assigned a Late Cretaceous age. Wilson (1952 demonstrated that at least part of the Tomillo Clays were Tertiary in age, based on their mammalian fossil content. The most extensive study of Big Bend National Park geology was published by Maxwell et al. (1967) . In this study, the Tomillo Clays were given the stratigraphic rank of group. The newly formed Tomillo Group was subdivided into the Javelina (Late Cretaceous), Black Peaks (Paleocene), and Hamiold Hill (early Eocene) formations (Fig. 3 ). This nomenclature has been challenged (Lawson, 1972; Schiebout et al., 1987 Schiebout et al., , 1988 , based mainly on the assertion that the formations are too difficult to discem from each other because they represent different developmental degrees of the same fluvial depositional system. Their arguments have been disputed by Lehman (1988) , who pointed out the formations have afready been successfiilly mapped, and the deposits are discemable upon close examination of parameters such as color. Thus, I agree with Lehman (1988) that a revision of the terminology of Maxwell et al. is not required.",

However, the Javelina Formation has also yielded much fossil material. Udden (1907) first reported the presence of \"saurian bones\" in part of the Tomillo Clays now included in the Javelina Formation. B. Brown collected sauropod material for the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) in 1941. In 1947, W. Langston, Jr. and a group from Texas Technological College recovered a sauropod femur (Langston et al., 1989) . W. Langston, Jr. and coworkers also excavated a partial skeleton of Alamosaurus sanjuanensis in the early 1970's, and have recovered a great deal of pterosaur material belonging to the genus Quetzalcoatlus over the past twenty-five years (Lawson, 1975; Langston et al., 1989; Straight, 1996) . D.A. Lawson (1976) reported the presence of ceratopsians and theropods in the Javelina Formation. In recent years, field excursions led by T. Lehman have recovered additional sauropod and ceratopsian material from the Javelina Formation. Wheeler et al. (1994) reported the discovery of a new genus of dicotyledonous wood, an important find given the paucity of fossil plant material recovered from the Javelina Formation, relative to the Aguja and Black Peaks formations.",

They are composed almost entirely of smectite (Lehman, 1985) . Typical clay colors include dull shades of red, blue, green, gray, purple, yellow, and brown, with rare black and white layers. The clays are highly impervious to water, and thus weather in a \"creeping\" fashion described by Udden (1907) , in which the top few inches of the clays swell when wetted, then dessicate, crack, and erode via wind, water, or gravity. Calcium carbonate (CaCOj) nodules are common within the clays in many areas, forming an armored surface of nodules as the surrounding clay is weathered and eroded. These nodules typically range in diameter from 2 cm to 7 cm, with some as large as 20 cm (Maxwell et al., 1967) . These concretions are usually gray, yellow, offwhite, or purple in color, with rough exteriors and sometimes display shrinkage cracks (Udden, 1907) .",

The possibility that these two groups represent different growth stages of the same species should be considered. Unfortunately, there is very little literature pertaining to Late Cretaceous gastropods. Kues et al., 1980) . The type specimen consists of a left scapula, found with a right ischium designated a paratype (USNM 10487). The creation of a new taxon was justified because this specimen was the first sauropod reported from the Late Cretaceous of North America, and both bones were distinctive from those of other known sauropods. As noted by Gilmore, the distal process of the ischium is much shorter than in other sauropods, being subequal in size to the ilial articular peduncle (Fig. 7) . This gives the bone an almost bilaterally symmetrical outline in lateral view. The scapular shaft has a gradual expansion moving towards the suprascapular end, a condition not seen in any sauropod known at that time. This, combined with the lack of anterior and/or posterior expansion of either the proximal or distal end, and the orientation of the spine at ca. 90\u00b0",

It is the only known titanosaurid from North America, the only known Late Cretaceous sauropod from North America, and was one of the latest-surviving dinosaurs, existing to the very end of the Cretaceous. It is the defining member of the Alamosaurus fauna, the group of large terrestrial vertebrates indigenous to the southwestem United States during the Maastrichtian (Sloan, 1969; Lucas, 1981; Lehman, 1987) . As a titanosaurid living in the southwestem United States, its presence has been cited as evidence of a land bridge that connected North and South America in latest Cretaceous time, for titanosaurids were the dominant group of large herbivores in South America until the end of the Cretaceous (Sloan, 1969; Calvo and Bonaparte, 1991; McCord, 1997) . The absence of sauropods from much of the Cretaceous record in North America has also been explained by the poor preservation of terrestrial strata deposited during the mid-Cretaceous when the Cretaceous Interior Seaway flooded much of what is now the Westem Interior. Davies (1983) suggested that hadrosaur distribution was environmentally controlled, and the same may have been tme of sauropods. This possibility is bolstered by the strong correlation of ^. sanjuanensis to inland deposits (Lehman, 1989b) , which also holds for the Jurassic sauropod remains recovered from the Morrison Formation and contemporary strata. However, this idea is contradicted by the presence of sauropods in marginal marine deposits of early Cretaceous age (Lockley, 1986) .",

In some cases enough of this concretion was removed from a specimen to allow for examination of the bone surface undemeath. On some specimens, the outermost layer of bone was totally removed prior to preservation, allowing the concretionary material to infiltrate the bone and thus obscure any clear bone-concretion contact surface (thus explaining the ineffectiveness of the airscribe). Therefore, many specimens have not been fiilly cleaned. However, even with much of the concretion still intact, most of the elements lend themselves to easy identification and description. The concretion coating artificially inflates measurements, but the thickest layers of concretion observed are no more than 5 mm in thickness. Thus, linear measures should be no more than 1-2 cm greater than the tme measure of the specimen. All measurements were done with a metric tape measure.",

The values for shaft diameter are both less than shaft circumference, which is expected since circumference increases as the diameter is multipUed by pi. Distal width is the only disparate character, with the best fit line resulting in a higher coefficient than the RMA line. Observation of the specimens reveals that the distal end does not expand nearly as much as the proximal end with grovv^h. This suggests that the RMA value is more reasonable.

This bifiircation is not seen in Alamosaurus or other titanosamids. In lateral outline, Alamosaurus cervical neural arches are similar to those of many other sauropods, such as Camarasaurus supremus (Osbom and Mook, 1921) , Diplodocus carnegii (Hatcher, 1901) , Apatosaurus excelsus, and Apatosaurus louisae (Gihnore, 1936) . The cervical neural arches included in specimen TMM 43621-1 most strongly resemble cervical neural arches 3-9 of these taxa in having neural spines that are tallest posteriorly, a neural arch that is longer than it is tall, prezygapophyses that extend forward on finger-like projections, and short postzygapophyses attached just above the posterior base of the neural spine. In Apatosaurus, Camarasaurus, and Diplodocus these characters begin to change at cervicals 7-9, such that the neural spines are taller and often reach their peak more anteriorly. This has the effect of changing the lateral outline of the neural spine from that of an ahnost right triangle to a pyramidal form. The partial neural spine attached to the seventh (?) cervical centrum has this \"pyramidal\" morphology, indicating its placement in the cervical series is definitely posterior to cervical 6.",

A peduncle extends posterodorsally from the dorsal margin of the shaft and articulates with the ilium, and a distal process extends posteroventrally from the ventral margin of the shaft, articulating with the opposite ischium along its ventral border. In most sauropods, the length of the distal process is equal to or greater than the length of the shaft and ilial articular peduncle combined. However, this is not the case in Alamosaurus sanjuanensis (Fig. 7) . The ischium of Alamosaurus possesses a distal process that is subequal in length to the ilial articular peduncle, giving the bone a symmetrical lateral outline unlike the ischia of other sauropods. In other titanosaurids, such as Malawisaurus dixeyi (Jacobs et al, 1993) , Titanosaurus colberti (Jain and Bandyopadhyay, 1997) , and Andesaurus delgadoi (Calvo and Bonaparte, 1991) the distal process is not as elongate as in nontitanosaurid sauropods, but is still noticeably longer and broader than the ilial articular peduncle when seen in lateral view. The distal process of the ischium of Saltasaurus loricatus figured by Powell (1986 Powell ( , 1992 is incomplete and its length cannot be determined. The short distal process of Alamosaurus is not an ontogenetic character, as the ischia of USNM 10487 and USNM 15560 (both adult Alamosaurus individuals) have the same form. Thus, this trait can be considered autapomorphic for ^. sanjuanensis.",

In this aspect, Alamosaurus most closely resembles Brachiosaurus (Janensch, 1914) and Ceteosaurus (= Cetiosaurusl, Phillips, 1874) .

Twenty-five to thirty-five milligrams were weighed out and sealed in reaction vessels, with 30 ml of 100% phosphoric acid solution in the other half of the vessel. The tubes were hooked to a vacuum line and evacuated for 2 hours. After being closed, the tubes were placed in a water bath for 15 minutes to stabiHze the samples' temperature at 25.2\u00b0 C.

The sections studied by Ferguson et al. (1991) are on Dawson Creek and at Dogie Mt., where the position of the K/T boundary cannot be constrained any closer than within about 20 meters. The breccia layer thought to represent the K/T boundary at the Grapevine Hills locality lies approximately at the 60 m mark, just below the isotope excursion noted above. The disparity between the stratigraphic and isotopic placement of the K/T boundary cannot be quantified due to the absence of nodules between 66 and 94.5 m. Paleontologic evidence places the K/T boundary no more than a few meters above the breccia layer. Thus, if the isotope excursion coincides with the K/T boundary, the excursion occurs no higher than the 70 m mark. If the trend matches that seen higher in the section, the excursion is even larger than recorded here (ca. 6 % drop in 6'CpDB and ca. 7% drop in S'^Opoe)-",

In a random sample of twelve individuals, the two measurements were always within 2 mm of each other. Viviparus trochiformis has a smooth trochiform shell that is an average of 10-15 mm long. Curved growth lines are on the shell. A few individuals of Goniobasis tenera were collected in the thin breccia horizon. These are small (average length 10-15 mm), high-spiraled forms with axial plications on the apical whorls. Five prominent raised spiral lirae are present on each whorl. The body whorl is an average of 5-7 mm in diameter. Goniobasis is a member of the Cyclophoridae; this family contains terrestrial and freshwater species. The fourth species is represented by a single, tiny (length = 9 mm) individual collected in the breccia layer, and has not been identified. The presence of these gastropod species indicates that the deposits are not of marine origin.A random sample of thirty individuals collected in float revealed Viviparus trochiformis to be the most abundant (21 individuals), with the remainder of the sample containing only V. retusus.

The site, located in the Upper Cretaceous Javelina Formation, represents a lake deposit as evidenced by the carbonaterich clay deposits and fi-eshvv^ater microfauna ofgastropods, fish, and algae. The vertebrate fossil collection places the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary within approximately a 2 m stratigraphic interval, making this site the most tightly constrained K/T boundary section in the Big Bend region.",
