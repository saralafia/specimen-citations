This assemblage is comprised of scincomorph, anguimorph, and ophidian taxa and is the most inclusive of its kind thus far described from the southern faunal province of Laramidia. Among numerous taxa described herein, three (Hypostylos lehmani gen. et sp. nov., Bothriagenys flectomendax sp. nov., and Hydrargysaurus gladius gen. et sp. nov) pertain to new scincomorphs which dominate the assemblage; however, subordinate anguimorphs are also well-represented. Snakes are represented by a single taxon, aff. Coniophis; a species seemingly ubiquitous throughout most Campanian strata in the southern Western Interior. Comparison among squamate assemblages from similar coastal facies in the upper shale of the Aguja Formation as well as the paracontemporaneous Wahweap and Kaiparowits formations of southern Utah reveals patterns of biogeographic segregation among some lizard species and the presence of two distinct communities. These two 'southern' squamate faunas are likely the result of variables involving climate and eustacy which facilitated diversity as well as the development of sub-provincial quarters of endemism during early-middle Campanian time.",

The present study is one of several intended to document the vertebrate fauna known from the lower shale member of the Aguja Formation. The squamate assemblage described herein comprises part of a diverse fauna collected at a single microvertebrate site (TMM 45947) situated on private ranchland just west of Big Bend National Park (Fig. 1) . The fauna obtained at this site is referred to as the \"Lowerverse local fauna\". Small theropods from this locality were previously described by Wick et al. (2015) and mammals by Brink (2016) . Dinosaurs and mesoreptiles recovered from the lower shale elsewhere were described by Lehman et al. (2019) .",

Included is a description of the most abundant and best preserved taxa which largely pertain to both Scincomorpha and Anguimorpha with three scincomorphs attributed to new species (Hypostylos lehmani gen. et sp. nov., Bothriagenys flectomendax sp. nov., and Hydrargysaurus gladius gen. et sp. nov.). A snake is also represented. Although similar assemblages have been reported previously from the Aguja Formation, all are from the late Campanian (Judithian age) portion of the upper shale member (Rowe et al., 1992; Miller, 1997; Sankey, 1998 Sankey, , 2008 Nydam et al., 2013) . In contrast, the Lowerverse assemblage belongs to one of only a few early Campanian (Aquilan age) terrestrial microvertebrate faunas known from North America and is likely temporally intermediate between that of the older Milk River Formation of Alberta and those of the younger Wahweap and Oldman formations of Utah and Alberta (Fowler, 2017; Lehman et al., 2019) . The Lowerverse lizard squamate assemblage is the most inclusive of its kind thus far described from the taxonomically distinctive, southern faunal province of Late Cretaceous Laramidia (Lehman, 1997 (Lehman, , 2001 ).",

Lehmani resemble those pertaining to an indeterminate scincomoprh (MSC-Pv 41) similarly from Campanian-aged strata of Argentina (Brizuela and Albino, 2011) ; however, in that specimen, the posterior subdental lamina is thicker and crowns extend much further beyond the lateral parapet than in H. lehmani. Some crowns among the referred specimens exhibit apical damage consistent with transport or, possibly, gastric corrosion as the result of being digested. In those specimens where gastric corrosion is possible, only that portion of the tooth above the gingiva has been affected resulting in apical exposure of the pulp cavity. Elsewhere, these ostensibly digested specimens are well-preserved. The most complete crowns are preserved in TMM 45947-501. A slight facet is present on their mesial surfaces ( Fig. 3J ). None of these (or those elsewhere among the better preserved crowns in H. lehmani) exhibit evidence of anguli, straiae, or cuspes common to Becklesius, Paramacellodus, Pseudosaurillus becklesi, or Parasaurillus Fig. 2 . General tooth crown nomenclature used herein to describe scincomorphan lizard teeth with generalized tooth representations of (A) a paramecellodid/cordylid-grade taxon and (B) a scincid-grade taxon. Both diagrams featured in lingual view.

Although they are somewhat blunter than in cf. Pseudosaurillus sp., they are not sharply pointed and striated as in Parasaurillus pseudobtusus (Evans and Searle, 2002) . Overall, teeth in H. lehmani compare most closely with those of cf. Pseudosaurillus sp. (Nydam, 2002) and, to a lesser degree, LSMUG 140:6101 (Sankey, 1998) in having such low crowns that, in life, very little of each tooth would have extended above the gingiva. TMM 45947-502 (holotype) pertains to a medial left maxilla (Fig. 3AeD) . The labial surface is smooth and has two labial foramina. The lingual surface preserves three partially eroded teeth and a well preserved portion of the supradental shelf. The wing-like palatine process is preserved as is the dorsal opening of the superior alveolar canal which is situated at the end of the shallow maxillary sulcus dentalis. The supradental shelf in TMM 45947-502 abruptly narrows both anterior and posterior to the palatine process. Thus, we surmise the maxillary sulcus dentalis (\u00bc \"supradental gutter\") in TMM 45947-502 to have been similarly narrow and shallow as described in OMNH 27711 by Nydam (2002, p. 647) . Just above the superior alveolar canal lies the medial recess for the nasal sac. However, dorsal to it, the bulk of the facial process of the maxilla is missing and only a portion of the posterior facet for articulation with the prefrontal is preserved. What remains suggests that posterior process was rather low along most of its length until it approached the area of the superior alveolar canal where the dorsal margin of the bone began to ascend. However, the degree of steepness cannot be determined. The apparently low posterior process in TMM 45947-502 is reflected in the posterior maxillary process in OMNH 27711 (very tentatively referred by Nydam, 2002 to cf. Pseudosaurillus sp.) as well as the rather low process in Paramacellodus oweni. It is certainly lower throughout its posterior length than in Pseudosaurillus becklesi, and Parasaurillus pseudobtusus (\u00bcPseudosaurillus sp.) (Estes, 1983; Evans and Searle, 2002; Nydam, 2002) . The dentary in H. lehmani is represented by two anterior fragments (TMM 45947-503, -505), a medial fragment (TMM45947-501), and three posterior fragments (TMM 45947-504, -541, -567). Collectively, approximately 80% of the element is represented. The labial surface in all specimens is smooth and sometimes exhibits small mental foramina. In the anterior dentary fragments, the subdental lamina is comparatively deep but transversely narrow with a shallow sulcus dentalis. In the most informative of the two specimens (TMM 45947-503), the subdental lamina thickens and widens as it trends anteriorly until it reaches the area of the fragmented symphysis (Fig.3H, I ). Below this area, Meckel's canal is shallow, narrow, and ventrally oriented throughout its trend to beneath the first tooth position where it terminates. The mesialmost teeth in TMM 45947-503 are procumbent while those in more distal specimens are generally erect. Similar to other teeth pertaining to this species, the most complete tooth in TMM 45947-503 is smooth, columnar, and has a slight medial constriction as noted above and, as preserved, seemingly shows that the crown extended slightly above the lateral parapet. Although the dentary lateral wall in the medial dentary fragment (TMM 45947-501) is broken, its remains suggest that Meckel's canal was medially oriented in more posterior portions of the jaw. The most complete posterior fragment (TMM 45947-567) confirms this and also reveals that Meckel's canal was widely open (Fig. 3K, L) .",

                "text": "Remarks. The teeth in Hypostylos lehmani are generally comparable to Pseudosaurillus and Parasaurillus but the crowns in H. lehmani lack the conspicuous coronal striae and anguli present in those forms. In fact, Evans and Searle (2002) presented an interesting discourse regarding the generic distinctiveness of Pseudosaurillus and Parasaurillus as it relates to their work involving crown ornamentation among other, closely related \"paramacellodids\". It is, therefore, implausible that Hypostylos pertains to either genus, or, in fact, to any of the \"paramacellodids\" therein. However, Nydam (2002) very tentatively referred OMNH 27711 to cf. Pseudosaurillus sp. due to a seeming (?taphonomic) lack of comparable striae; however, it is also quite possible that they were never present to begin with. In most respects, the more complete teeth and crowns in H. lehmani are remarkably congruent with those of OMNH 27711 (i.e., they are narrow cylindrical, closely spaced, low crowned, and apically smooth). H. lehmani also shares a shallow, narrow maxillary sulcus dentalis and low form regarding the posterior maxillary process. These strong similarities indicate that H. lehmani pertains to an unknown 'paramacellodid' scincomorphan. Although we suggest that OMNH 27711 and H. Lehmani most likely pertain to the same taxon, the crowns in OMH 27711 are somewhat pointed. Therefore, we stop short of referring OMNH 27711 to H. lehmani but instead refer it to Hypostylos sp. due to subtle differences involving crown morphology and, to a lesser extent, temporal and geographic separation. Of interest is that the low crowns in Hypostylos resemble those of the (Neogene to modern) scincid Eumeces (Cifelli et al., 1999; Bailon and Aouraghe, 2002) . Although extant forms of Eumeces are generally insectivorous, some members of the genus will also take small snails (Moran, 1979) . Thus, it is possible that the low, columnar teeth and crowns of Hypostylos are similarly related to intermittent durophagy although not to the extent implied by those of Catactegenys or Apsgnathus (above). We also consider Sankey's (1998 Sankey's ( , 2008 referral of maxillary specimen LSUMG 140:6106 from the upper shale of the Aguja Formation to an indeterminate glyptosaurine to be questionable. Odaxosaurus is known from the upper shale as well as late Campanian strata in nearby Mexico and exhibits some similarity regarding tooth shaft form and spacing (Aguillon-Mart\u00ednez, 2010; Nydam et al., 2013 and see discussion therein). As figured by Sankey (1998 Sankey ( , 2008 the apices of the crowns in LSMUG 140:6106 do not extend beyond the lateral parapet to the same degree as in that taxon. Furthermore, the teeth in LSUMG 140:6106 seemingly lack any evidence of the chisel-like crowns, transverse compression, and deep apical striae common to glyptosaurines (Gilmore, 1928; Estes, 1964 Estes, , 1983 Gao and Fox, 1996; Aguillon-Mart\u00ednez, 2010) . Although these conditions may be the result of erosion, we still regard the specimen indeterminate as figured (Sankey, 1998, fig. 1.21C; 2008, fig. 5.3.24) . Given its superficial similarity to Hypostylos we consider it more likely that LSUMG 140:6106 pertains to H. lehmani especially since two other lizards (Catactegenys and Apsgnathus) apparently occur in both the lower and upper shale members of the Aguja Formation.",

Both the labial and lingual surfaces of the crowns are striated to varying degrees depending upon their position within the dental arcade. None of the specimens exhibits resorption pitting. Teeth show a similar degree of heterodonty described in Catactegenys solaster by Nydam et al. (2013) . Specimens TMM 45947-506 and -510 are presumed to be anterior dentary fragments. These bear comparatively small, procumbent teeth having striated crowns with two poorly developed fossae (\u00bc incipient antra intercristatum anterior and posterior) separated by a prominent cuspis lingualis (e.g., TMM 45947-510) ( Fig. 4B) . A single specimen (TMM 45947-507) possesses a pair of teeth with crowns which exhibit the 'anterior' condition to the greatest degree. They do not appear procumbent in lingual view as do those from the anterior dentary. As such, we feel that this bone fragment likely pertains to a premaxilla but, as preserved, the element is not morphologically informative. Two other fragmentary specimens seemingly pertain to more posterior portions of the dentary (e.g., TMM 45947-509). Teeth are comparatively more robust, exhibit medially swollen tooth shafts, and at least one has a distinct ring of basal cementum. All of the preserved crowns exhibit prominent cristae lingualis and labialis which are joined by a transversely oriented, crista intercuspidalis. Unlike in more mesial teeth, the antra intercristatum here are fully developed ( Fig. 4A ). As teeth trend distally, the lingually-oriented facets of mesial crowns are progressively altered into these increasingly well-developed and more apically positioned features. Although crowns in both mesial and distal teeth bear conspicuous striae on their lingual and labial surfaces; distal crowns are also faintly striated within each antrum ( Fig. 4A ).",

                "text": "Etymology. Latin flecto (curve) and mendax (false) in regard to the unequal cristae mesialis and distalis which gives the tooth the false appearance of being recurved. Holotype. TMM 45947-517 (anteriormost left dentary fragment with intact teeth) ( Fig. 5C, D) . Referred Specimens. TMM 45947-515, -516, -518 (anterior and posterior jaw fragments); Kaiparowits Formation Morphotype A (OMNH 33863, 33883; dentary and maxilla fragments with teeth) (Nydam, 2013 5E ). It bears somewhat smaller teeth than the other specimens referred to B. flectomendax. However, their morphology is consistent with the other referred specimens and so this disparity in size is likely an age-related one. Among the referred specimens, most crowns are medially deflected to some degree and slightly rotated with respect to the long axis of the jaw. Teeth are generally subpleurodont but not fully pleurodont as in B. mysterion. In medial view, the tooth shafts are straight sided but they expand somewhat mediolaterally toward their bases. A few have large basal resorption pits. Similar to B. mysterion (below), all crowns possess cristae mesialis and distalis which do not bear cusplets. Also as in B. mysterion, these cristae wrap ventromedially around the crown until their respective culmina lateris become obsolete approximately one third or more of the distance from their point of origin at the cuspis labialis. They are longer than in B. mysterion where analogous culmina similarly disappear only one quarter of their way down the crown. Most significantly, the crista mesialis in B. flectomendax is consistently better developed than the crista distalis ( Fig. 5AeE ) affording the teeth a false aspect of being recurved as in nearly identical crowns and teeth of (unnamed) Kaiparowits Formation Morphotype A (KFmA) (Nydam, 2013, fig. 16 .14 A-E) but unlike the preserved teeth of B. mysterion in which the cuspis labialis is centrally positioned on the crown resulting in equally long cristae which give teeth in that taxon an erect appearance. An anterior dentary fragment (TMM 45947-517) possesses three mesialmost teeth. They are situated upon a well-developed subdental lamina and somewhat narrow but well developed sulcus dentalis as in B. mysterion. The symphysis is narrow and does not extend beneath the first tooth position. The two mesialmost teeth are and inclined mesially. Their crowns possess enlarged cristae mesialis and, hence, exhibit the false recurvature consistent with crowns in the other specimens referred to B. flectomendax. Like its posterior counterpart (TMM 45947-515; see below), the anterior portion of Meckel's canal opens ventrally as a narrow slit and, in the anterior fragment, continues to the symphysis as in B. mysterion (Nydam, 2002) . However, teeth from a specimen pertaining to a medial part of the dentary (TMM 45947-516) are comparatively taller in comparison to those from anterior and posterior portions of the jaw (see below) and similar to KFmA, are subpluerodont in attachment, and have modest amounts of cementum at their bases. A partial resorption pit is also seemingly preserved at the base of the mesialmost tooth ( Fig. 5E ). Similar to both KFmA and B. mysterion, widely separated striae dominans anterior and posterior converge apically at a distinct cuspis lingualis although the consistent position of the cuspis is taxonomically variable between them. Also as in KFmA, B. flectomendax exhibits conspicuous secondary striae on the crown's lingual facets between the cristae and striae dominans as well as between both striae dominans, and similar to KFmA, those between the striae dominans are longer and better defined. This condition differs significantly from the teeth of B. mysterion where discernible secondary striae are weak to absent (Nydam, 2002) and certainly contrasts markedly with the truly recurved teeth of Penemabuya and Dimekodontosaurus (Gao and Fox, 1996; Nydam, 2002) where analogous cristae and striae are similarly reduced. The posterior dentary fragment (TMM 45947-515) preserves four intact teeth. Here, the dentary is mediolaterally crushed and the lingual margin of the subdental lamina has folded into the narrow, ventrally open canal for Meckel's cartilage. However, what remains conforms to descriptions for B. mysterion by Nydam (2013) in that the canal for Meckel's is rather narrow and the posterior opening of the canal was wide and seemingly occurred abruptly. Furthermore, all four preserved crowns are striated, deflected somewhat medially, and exhibit the false recurvature as in other teeth referred herein to B. flectomendax. With respect to the presence of crown curvature and striae, the distal teeth in B. flectomendax resemble the blocky distal teeth of Dimekodontosaurus madseni. However, unlike in D. madseni where distal dentary teeth are taller than mesial ones, the distal teeth in B. flectomendax are comparatively shorter than more mesial teeth e especially those in the middle of the jaw (represented in B. flectomendax by TMM 45947-516) which we attribute to ontogenetic variation. However, all crowns exhibit well-developed cristae mesialis and distalis as well as secondary lingual striae identical to those in the presumed middle of the dentary. In any case, without respect to height, the teeth in B. flectomendax are similar enough in form to indicate that the dentition was generally homodont. The distal teeth in the posterior dentary fragment (TMM 45947-515) are shorter and basally more robust than more mesial teeth and the conspicuous cuspes lingualis seen on tooth crowns in the (presumed) medial dentary fragment are not similarly well defined as on the distal teeth; only one has a defined cuspis lingualis (second from the rear; Fig. 5A ). We consider these modest disparities to reflect positionally-related variation. As such, we cautiously refer TMM 45947-515 to B. flectomendax sp. nov. pending the discovery of more complete jaw material.",

                "text": "Description. Complete teeth are pleurodont. Although matrix covers portions of the dentition in most specimens, modest amounts of basal cementum is evident. Similar to B. mysterion, all of the jaw fragments bear narrow, closely spaced teeth with conical, unicuspid crowns. The crowns in TMM 45947-511 are un-to weakly striated on their lingual surfaces as in OMNH 28119 but the striae dominans are slightly more pronounced (Fig. 5F ). In medial view, teeth are straight sided; however, they all bear labiolingually expanded shafts. None of the teeth are recurved (Fig. 5F ). Similar to Bothriagenys flectomendax sp. nov. (above), most teeth are slightly rotated with respect to the long axis of the jaw and their apices exhibit a modest lingual deflection. However, in spite of slight differences involving height and rotation, the teeth described here indicate that the dentition appears to be similarly homodont ostensibly as in the holotype (OMNH 28119, Nydam, 2002) . We note, however, that Nydam's perception of homodonty was based upon similar shape and size of the preserved tooth bases as most crowns in OMNH 28119 are broken. The cristae mesialis and distalis are comparatively shorter than in B. flectomendax. Also, although they similarly wrap ventrolingually around the crown, none of the teeth exhibit apices which are mediodistally offset to the degree observed in B. flectomendax where, as a result, the crista mesialis is considerably longer that the crista distalis. As such, the preserved teeth in B. mysterion appear erect and do not exhibit the (false) recurvature seen in B. flectomendax. The right premaxillary fragment (TMM 45947-512) is not very informative. The nasal process is completely missing as is the articular surface for the maxilla. On the lingual side, along with a portion of supradental shelf and the right incisive process, it preserves two complete teeth. The lateral tooth possesses an unstriated crown that exhibits a wear facet on its lateral side so lack of ornamentation here is very likely due to in vivo wear. This tooth exhibits a resorption pit at its base which is consistent with an old tooth in the process of being replaced. The medial tooth possesses a complete crown that is similar to those described above in that it does not exhibit any curvature. However, its position in the front of the snout makes curvature determination difficult. Furthermore, it does not exhibit lingual ornamentation other than weak cristae mesialis and distalis. Because of the fragmentary nature and obvious tooth wear exhibited by the crowns in this specimen, our referral of TMM 45947-512 to B. mysterion is tentative. The three dentary fragments (TMM 45947-511, 513, 514) seemingly exhibit similar characteristics decribed by Nydam (2002) for B. mysterion. Meckel's canal opens ventrally as a narrow slit for most of the length of the dentary and teeth project above a well developed subdental lamina and narrow sulcus dentalis. They do not extend as far above the lateral parapet as those of B. flectomendax (i.e., they are fully pleurodont in those referred to B. mysterion here). TMM 45947-513 and 514 pertain to the anteriormost portion of a left dentary and anterior right dentary respectively. Neither preserves a symphysis. In both specimens, the ventrally open Meckel's canal is very narrow and the pars furcata is striated. Similar striae are generally absent (or poorly developed) on the flanking lingual facets situated between the striae dominans and crisae mesialis and distals compared to B. flectomendax. Based upon the ventral orientation and openness of Meckel's canal (as preserved), we interpret specimen TMM 45947-511 as pertaining to a posterior left dentary fragment; however, the lingual wall of the subdental lamina is broken. What remains bears two complete teeth and two bases. The preserved crowns are symmetrical as it relates to the respective lengths of the cristae mesialis and distalis; their pointed apices are centered upon the crown as opposed to those of B. flectomendax. The complete teeth in this specimen are comparatively taller than those of the anterior dentary fragments and extend considerably further above the lateral parapet; however, they are still pleurodont in attachment. The mesialmost complete tooth has a resorption pit at its base ( Fig. 5F ).",

As preserved, the three specimens pertaining to Bothriagenys flectomendax are markedly similar to both B. mysterion (Nydam, 2002) and KFmA (Nydam, 2013) regarding morphologies involving both tooth crowns ornamentation and dentary architecture. The principal differences with B. mysterion involves B. flectomendax having; 1) distinctly longer and asymmetric striae dominans anterior and posterior which give the teeth a false appearance of being recurved, 2) crowns that extend further above the lateral parapet (subpleurodont), and 3) to a lesser degree, lingual surfaces that exhibit more distinct striae. However, B. flectomendax is almost identical to specimens assigned to the \"unnamed taxon\" identified by Nydam (2013, p. 402) as pertaining to KFmA where teeth likewise exhibit a false recurvature and crowns are conspicuously striated on their lingual facets. As such, we advocate that KFmA and the specimens described herein (OMNH 33863, 33883) pertain to the same novel taxon herein designated Bothriagenys flectomendax sp. nov. Interestingly, the specimens pertaining to B. flectomendax as well as KFmA share significant similarities to Paramacellodus sp. from the Jurassic of Utah (e.g., pleurodont teeth situated above a strong subdental shelf, narrow teeth that exhibit a medial curvature of the crown, crowns that are smooth labially and roughly striated lingually, and small symphysial region) Chure, 1998, 1999) .

The crowns project above a welldeveloped subdental lamina and they are slightly rotated with respect to the long axis of the jaw. Also, crown apices are likewise somewhat offset distally and have distinct, ventrolingually wrapped cistae mesialis and distalis of slightly unequal lengths. We surmise TMM 45947-519 to pertain to the rear of the jaw which may account for the progressive distal curvature of the crowns (Fig. 5G, H ). However, unlike B. mysterion and B. flectomendax, the lingual surfaces of the crowns in cf. Bothriagenys sp. are conspicuously unstriated and lack a distinctive cuspis lingualis. What remains of Meckel's canal is narrow. Remarks regarding cf. Bothriagenys sp. In most regards, the teeth in cf. Bothriagenys sp. compare favorably to Bothriagenys. Aside from possible positional differences, we further attribute the above variations to ontogeny and posit that this specimen could pertain to a young individual of either species (e.g., see TMM 45947-516 above). For example, in the extant scincid Chalcides viridanus (Delgado et al., 2004) , crown morphology transforms from a simple smooth crown in the late embryo to the typically ornamented adult morphology involving lingually wrapped cristae mesialis and distalis, lingually deflected crowns with well-developed striae dominans, and well-developed pars furcata with distinct secondary lingual striae. It is possible that this ontogenetic process similarly affected the degree of ornamentation, apical offset, and apparent recurvature of the crowns in Bothriagenys as well.",

                "text": "Description. The six specimens assigned to cf. Socognathus sp. are comprised of robust teeth that pertain to a large borioteiioidian. Crowns have strongly convex labial surfaces and the apex of each tooth is (variably) directed medially similar to those described in Socognathus unicuspis (Nydam et al., 2013) . As in S. unicuspis, the central portion of the lingual surface of the crown is medially expanded to form a central ridge where, in most specimens, a single, distinct lingual stria is present (Fig.4E, F) . This condition is similar to \"faint striations\" present lingually on the apical cusp in some specimens of S. unicuspis described by Peng et al. (2001. P. 27) and Gao and Fox (1996, p. 26) . Although the presence or absence of lingual striae in both cf. Socognathus sp. and S. unicuspis is likely related to ontogeny, none of the study specimens exhibit multiple straia and we feel that this distinction in number may be of taxonomic significance. In any case, similar distinctive straie were apparently not observed in S. Brachyodon by Longrich et al. (2012a Longrich et al. ( , 2013 and striae are not present on both lingual and labial surfaces as in the similarly cusped crowns of Orthrioscincus (Brinkman, 2014) . On the flanks of the central ridge are shallow fossae associated with the mesial and distal expansions of the crown (crista mesialis and distalis). The mesial crista is comparatively better developed then the distal one giving the crowns an asymmetric aspect. Both ridges gently curve ventrolingually around the crown, albeit only for a short distance. All crowns in the study collection are weakly tricuspid or \"trifid\" as in S. unicuspis with mesial accessory cusps being more prominent than distal ones (Peng et al., 2001; Nydam et al., 2010 Nydam et al., , p. 1094 . In occlusal view, the outline of the apex, accessory cusps, and cristae similarly form a weak, assymetrical W-shape. All crowns in the study collection possess accessory cusps that are somewhat better developed than in S. unicuspis being more akin to those of S. brachyodon as described by Longrich et al. (2012a Longrich et al. ( , 2013 . On the other hand, Goa and Fox (1996, p. 26) describe dentary crowns in S. unicuspis as \"basically unicuspid, with no tendency towards developing tricuspid crowns as is characteristic of Chamops\". We consider this seeming discrepancy as a matter of interpretation. The crowns of Chamops are noticeably tricuspid while those of Socognathus are either weakly so or nearly unicuspid (likely due to positional differences) which reflects a certain degree of heterodonty in this taxon (sensu Gao and Fox, 1991) . The specimen with the preserved shaft (TMM 45947-521) exhibits a base that is labiolingually wide as in S. unicuspis. As preserved, the shaft is columnar in appearance with generally straight mesial and distal sides as in S. brachyodon but this specimen possesses a crown that is that is comparatively smaller than the most other shed crowns in the study collection ( Fig. 4F ). Hence, it is possible that the specimen pertains to a comparatively slender, cusped distal tooth as described in S. brachydon (Longrich et al., 2012a (Longrich et al., , 2013 . Breakage on the specimen with the preserved shaft seems to indiciate either a pleurodont or sub-pleurodont attachement but it cannot be determined if the teeth were labiolingually rotated as in other Socognathus specimens (Longrich et al., 2012a (Longrich et al., , 2013 Brinkman, 2014) . BORIOTEIIOIDEA Nydam et al. (2007) . CHAMOPSIIDAE, Nydam, Caldwell, and Fanti (2010) aff. Socognathus (Fig. 4G ).",

It also appears nearly symmetrical in apical aspect with very low secondary cusplets being of generally equal proportions (although one accessory cusplet is partially broken, its form can still be determined). Furthermore, the specimen lacks the single, distinct lingual stria seen in cf. Socognathus sp. (the seeming presence of one in Figure 4G are combined artifacts of preservation and imaging). It also dissimilarly bears a wide, conspicuous collar around the base of the crown which exhibits very fine vertical striae. Although TMM 49547-522 has seeming affinities to Socognathus, it clearly pertains to a much larger taxon than material referred to either S. unicuspis or herein to cf. Socognathus sp. and likely represents a closely related, unnamed species. Remarks regarding Socognathus. Our tentative referral of specimens to cf. Socognathus sp. and aff. Socognathus is based upon isolated teeth and crowns. Because Socognathus unicuspis is partially diagnosed based upon elements not available here (Nydam et al., 2010), we stop short of a more confident assignment regarding cf. Socognathus sp. On the other hande, our referral of TMM 45947-522 to aff. Socognathus reflect even more doubt as we believe it may pertain to a different, closely-related genus. However, our cautious referrals seem plausible given the morphological consistency among our specimens and their close resemblance to teeth pertaining to Socognathus. If either Lowervese specimen indeed pertains to Socognathus as implied here, its presence in the lower shale of the Aguja Formation would represent the oldest known occurrence as well as a significant range extension for this species currently restricted to younger Campanian and Maastrichtian strata of the Northern Great Plains (e.g., Gao and Fox, 1996; Peng et al., 2001 Longrich, 2012a Longrich, , 2013 .

                "text": "Description. This specimen consists of a fragmentary right dentary with two complete teeth and one preserved shaft (Fig. 6AeC) . Unfortunately, matrix covers the greater portion of the sulcus dentalis and interdental spaces; only the crowns and a single tooth base are exposed. The longest preserved tooth appears to be pleurodont to subpleurodont in attachment. As commonly observed among borioteiioids (Nydam et al., 2007) , the characteristic presence of cementum in TMM 45947-524 cannot be conclusively determined. As in Chamops and Leptochamops, the main cusp is centrally located on the crown (e.g., Gilmore, 1928 , Estes, 1964 , Gao and Fox, 1991 , 1996 Nydam and Voci, 2007; Nydam, 2013) . This condition differs somewhat from Meniscognathus altmani (Estes, 1964; Gao and Fox, 1996) , M. molybrochoros (Nydam, 2013) , and Leptochamops sp. (Larson et al., 2010) in which tooth apices are offset distally. In TMM 45947-524, the apex of the crown is situated atop the cuspis labialis. Although it exhibits surface cracking, the unstriated pars furcata is flanked by distinct striae dominans which converge apically to define the cuspis lingualis (Fig. 6A ). These principal cuspes are in close proximity upon the crown and separated only by a narrow saddle. In occlusal aspect, the crowns are only slightly rotated in their orientation to the long axis of the jaw (Fig. 6C ). The preserved crowns in TMM 45947-524 are tricuspid as in other specimens referred to Chamops and Leptochamops (e.g., Gilmore, 1928; Estes, 1964; Gao and Fox, 1996; Sankey, 1998 Sankey, , 2008 Brinkman, 2014) but are not like Haptosphenus placodon where the crowns are described as often being \"shouldered\" as opposed to bearing discrete cusplets (Estes, 1964, p. 116) . Each cusplet in the preserved crowns of TMM 45947-524 distinctly protrudes from the cristae mesialis and distalis and, as such, are true cusplets rather than simple anguli. They do not protrude as much as in cf. Leptochamops or Trippenaculus eatoni from the Kaiparowitz Formation of Utah (Nydam and Voci, 2007) . In TMM 45947-524, both cusplets are equally well-developed giving the crown a symmetrical aspect in lingual view. This condition differs somewhat from Meniscognathus (Estes, 1964; Gao and Fox, 1996; Nydam, 2013) , and Leptochamops sp. (Larson, 2010) where, due to the offset apex of the crown, the unequal cristae mesialis and distalis gives the tooth a false appearance of being recurved. Furthermore, the mesial cusplet in Mensicognathus is better developed than in TMM 45947-524, Chamops, and Leptochamops. TMM 45947-524 also differs in this regard from the holotype of Obamadon (referred to Leptochamops by Bryant, 1989) where, in spite of a centrally positioned main cusp, the mesial cusplet is similarly pronounced (Longrich et al., 2012a (Longrich et al., , 2013 . It also differs from the subacrodont teeth of the enigmatic taxon Haptosphenus placodon where apical symmetry is seemingly restricted to posterior portions of the jaw (Estes, 1964; Gao and Fox, 1996) . In any case, the cristae mesialis and distalis in TMM 45947-524 trend away from the crown's apex until they reach the apices of their associated cusplets whereupon they diverge lingually and labially to form two culmina lateris (one on each face of the crown). On each face, these are separated from the main cusp by smooth grooves. However, as in Leptochamops denticulatus and L. thrinax, the grooves in TMM 45947-524 are decidedly more pronounced on the lingual side of the crown, and although analogous grooves are also apparent on its labial side, they are not as well-developed as in Chamops or cf. Leptochamops (Gilmore, 1928; Estes, 1964; Gao and Fox, 1996; Nydam and Voci, 2007) . As opposed to C. segnis, the crowns of TMM 45947-524 have a somewhat 'tapered' appearance similar to those described by Estes (1964, p. 110) for Leptochamops where the \"lateral cusps are closely pressed to the main cusp\". The cusplets in TMM 45947-524 are not as pronounced as in C. segnis (Gilmore, 1928; Estes, 1964) and certainly not as much as in Trippenaculus eatoni (Nydam and Voci, 2007) . Tooth shafts are more columnar akin to Leptochamops denticulatus (Estes, 1964) and are not barrel-shaped as in Chamops segnis or Haptosphenus placodon (Estes, 1964; Gao and Fox, 1996; Nydam and Voci, 2002) . The crowns in TMM 45947-524 appear more closely spaced than those of Chamops which implies that comparatively more teeth would fit into the dental arcade as in Leptochamops (Estes, 1964) . As preserved, the fragmentary dentary is not very informative. In labial view, the fragment tapers in a way that strongly suggests that it pertains to the anterior portion of the element. A portion of a single mental foramen is preserved. In lingual view, although the sub-dental lamina appears modestly well-developed, it is seemingly not as deep as in Chamops segnis as described by Nydam and Voci (2007) ; however, its depth can be variable even within a single taxon (e.g. Leptochamops denticulatus; Estes, 1964) . Although matrix covers much of the jaw fragment's lingual surface, the teeth are pleurodont to slightly subpleurodont in attachment and dissimilar to the variably subpleurodont (distal) to subacrodont (mesial) manner of attachment typical of dentary teeth in Chamops (e.g., Gilmore, 1928; Estes, 1964; Longrich et al., 2012a Longrich et al., , 2013 . In any case, it appears as if Meckel's canal was open widely along the lingual side of the element; a morphology suggestive of the 'teiidlike' presence of a hypertrophied splenial that seemingly would have extended at least through the anterior three-quarters of the jaw in TMM 45947-524 (e.g., Estes, 1964; Gao and Fox, 1991; Nydam and Cifelli, 2002a; Nydam et al., 2007) . Remarks. A number of authors have noted the resemblance that 'teiid-like' scincomorphans have with iguanomorphs such as a widely open meckel's canal, pleurodont dentition, and tricuspid teeth (e.g., Gilmore, 1928; Estes and Price, 1973; Gao and Fox, 1996; Longrich et al., 2012a Longrich et al., , 2013 . Indeed, the teeth in TMM 45947-524 somewhat resemble those of the Late Cretaceous iguanomorphs Pariguana lancensis and Magnuviator ovimonsensis (Longrich et al., 2012a (Longrich et al., , 2013 DeMar et al., 2017) . Whatever the case, the preserved base and crowns in TMM 45947-524 compare more favorably with teeth of chamopsiids than to other taxa; hence, advocates referral of TMM 45947-524 to cf. Chamopsiidae (sensu Nydam et al., 2010) . Among them, the crowns in TMM 45947-524 most resemble those in Leptochamops but our reasoning is admittedly based upon morphologies exhibited by a single fragmentary specimen.",

The crowns are tricuspid with pointed central cusp and distinct mesial and distal cusplets situated along the cristae mesialis and distalis; however, the (presumed) mesial cusplets are somewhat larger. Similar to cf. Chamopsiidae Species 1 (above), the crowns in Species 2 are rotated somewhat from the long axis of the jaw but their lingual surfaces are unstriated and there is no pars furcata as in Species 1. The lingual surface of the crown and shaft in Species 2 are similar to Species 1 in that they are convex and possess distinct grooves separating the cristae labialis and lingualis from the crown's raised central portion. Similar fossae are very weakly developed on the labial side of the crowns similar to crowns in Chamops segnis (Gilmore, 1928; Estes, 1964 Estes, , 1983 . The largest preserved tooth in TMM 45847-525 is about .5 mm wide and is comparable in size to those of larger chamopsiids such as Chamops segnis, C. cf. segnis, and Chamops sp. as described or figured by Waldman (1970, p. 546) , Gao and Fox (1996, fig. 6 ), and Nydam (2013, fig. 16 ).",

A similar barrel-shaped condition is commonly seen in other chamopsiids (e.g., Chamops, Haptospehus, Socognathus, Sphenosaigon), but not all (e.g., Leptochamops denticulatus) (Gilmore, 1928; Estes, 1964; Gao and Fox, 1996; Longrich et al., 2012a Longrich et al., , 2013 . Also in the other chamopsiids mentioned above, similarly short, tricusped distal crowns often become progressively bicuspid (or even unicusped) as they trend rostrally. Furthermore, in C. segnis (Estes, 1964, fig. 45; Gao and Fox, 1996, fig. 6 ) the distal teeth are comparatively short as in TMM 45847-525. As such they appear to be attached in a pleurodont fashion compared to more mesial teeth which are subpleurodont (Estes, 1964; Sahni, 1972; Gao and Fox, 1996; Nydam, 2013) . Given that the somewhat squat teeth in TMM 45847-525 retain a tricuspid appearance, we suggest that it likely pertains to a posterior jaw fragment of a closely related species where the mode of distal tooth attachment may also vary. The area of the subdental lamina and sulcus dentalis is fragmentary and covered by matrix so it does not provide much useful morphological information. What remains of the subdental lamina is seemingly dorsoventrally narrow similar to Leptochamops; it is, however, seemingly much thinner than in Chamops where the lamina is comparatively deeper and the jaw more robust. The lateral wall of the dentary is fractured and has rotated into the canal for Meckel's cartilage ( Fig 6E) . In life, it seems that the canal would have opened lingually but the degree of openness cannot be determined.",

Similarities include the presence of barrel-shaped, subpleurodont teeth as well as generally symmetrical crowns with recessed grooves separating the cristae labialis and lingualis from the raised central cusp on both sides of the crown. Other workers have shown that the diversity of chamopsiid fossils seemingly decreases to the south and it appears that they did not exist south of Utah (Nydam et al., 2013 ; and see relevant discussion and references therein). If cf. Chamopsiidae Species 1 and 2 described here indeed pertain to Chamopsiidae (as well as LSUMG 140:6104, a figured but undescribed specimen also from Big Bend referred to Chamops sp. by Sankey, 1998 Sankey, , fig. 1.21E, 2008 , it would significantly extend the paleogeographic range of the clade and contribute to the discussion involving possible occurrences of paracontemporaneous chamopsiids from Texas and New Mexico (e.g. Chamops and Leptochamops, Armstrong-Zeigler, 1980; Sullivan, 1981; Gao and Fox, 1996; Sullivan and Lucas, 2006; Nydam and Voci, 2007; Sankey, 1998 Sankey, , 2008 Nydam et al., 2013) . Due to the fragmentary nature of our specimens, a confident referral of Species 1 and 2 to Chamopsiidae is not currently possible; however, it now seems likely that chamopsiids did, in fact, inhabit the southern faunal realm of North America during early Campanian time and possibly thereafter.",

Chamopsiidae consist of a complete tooth situated in a small, indeterminate jaw fragment (TMM 45947-531) as well as a second isolated (complete) tooth (TMM 45947-532) (Fig. 6D, G) . Given that the isolated tooth retains the entire circumference of its attachment surface, we suggest that it was taphonomically detached from its jaw rather than shed. In any case, both teeth are similar enough that any perceived differences could be attributed to positional variation within a single taxon so we herein cautiously regard them as conspecific. Tooth crowns are pleurodont to subpleurodont, closely spaced, moderately tall and erect. Tooth bases are labiolingually expanded but otherwise compressed mesiodistally and with straight sides which taper apically as in the Gerontoseps irvinensis (Gao and Fox, 1996) . Both specimens seem to possess vestiges of basal cementum although the subdental lamina in TMM 45947-531 dentary fragment is partially obscured by matrix. Tooth crowns are weakly tricuspid with a smooth and rather blunt central cusp flanked by small, generally symmetrical mesial and distal cusplets. Neither crown exhibits lingual straiae similar to G. irvinensis, Chamops, and cf. Chamopsiidae Species 2 (above) where they are also absent. Although the cusplets in TMM 45947-531 and -532 are not nearly as pronounced as in those taxa, the cristae and associated culmina lateris are better defined as in Bothriagenys where they similarly wrap lingually around the crown. However, the crowns differ from Bothriagenys in that lingual striae and pars furcata are absent and the blunted central cusp is segregated from the cristae mesialis and distalis by wider medial grooves as in some pleurodont, Late Cretaceous and Paleogene iguanomorphs such as Pariguana and Geiseltaliellus (Smith, 2006 (Smith, , 2009b Longrich et al., 2012a Longrich et al., , 2013 Bolet and Evans, 2013) . TMM 45947-531 is from a posterior left dentary but is not very informative for that element. The subdental lamina is thin and Meckel's canal was obviously widely open but its orientation cannot be determined. Remarks. Although both specimens exhibit morphologies consistent with several lizard forms, the seeming presence of basal cementum and broadly similar crown morphology to some \"teiids\" (e.g. Chamops, Gerontoseps) suggests a taxonomic placement within Borioteiioidea and possibly Chamopsiidae. These two specimens likely pertain to a taxon distinct from the others described herein.",

                "text": "Description. Portions of most specimens pertaining to this indeterminate borioteiioidian are somewhat obscured by matrix. However, they are generally well-preserved and provide for a reasonable assessment of the lower jaw and dentition in this taxon. As in other borioteiioidians, teeth are fully pleurodont with cementum and some exhibit deep replacement pits at their bases (Nydam et al., 2007) (Fig. 4I) . Teeth are tall, closely spaced, and cylindrical with straight sides similar to Leptochamops (Gao and Fox, 1996) . They differ in that only 25% or less of the tooth extends above the lateral parapet. Interestingly, the specimens grouped here are superficially similar but tooth crowns among them are somewhat chaotic in their form. Although crowns are similar in that they are smooth, narrow, columnar, and have acute apices, they noticeably vary in that their apices are somewhat offset in relation to the long axis of the tooth. Some exhibit an uneven, lingual 'shoulder' at approximately the same height as the lateral parapet. Furthermore, presumed medial dentary teeth (e.g., TMM 45947-530) are considerably taller than presumed teeth from specimens pertaining to anterior and posterior parts of the dentary (e.g., TMM 45947-526) (Fig. 4H, I ). Although this condition is similar to the dentition in Leptochamops denticulatus (Estes, 1964) , these indeterminate teeth differ in that only about 15% of tooth height extends beyond the comparatively deeper lateral parapet and the extension is restricted to tapered portions of the crown. Among the preserved crowns, the cristae mesialis and distalis are absent unlike in many other borioteiioidians (e.g., Socognathus, Chamops, Leptochamops) where crowns generally are cusped and striated to some degree. Conversely, as preserved, crowns in this indeterminate taxon are indisputably smooth, unicuspid, and the dention homodont throughout. Lastly, given that all preserved crowns in the study collection are morphologically consistent (except with respect to aforementioned overall tooth height and relative position of crown apices), we consider it very unlikely that the absence of crown ornamentation (e.g., striae, cristae) reflects excessive in vivo wear or pre-burial transport. Therefore, we suggest that they were possibly eroded by digestion prior to burial (see below). Where preserved, the dentary fragments in this indeterminate borioteiioidean have well-developed subdental laminae but only a narrow, shallow sulci dentalis which sometimes bear mental foramina on their labial surfaces. Typical among borioteiioideans, Meckel's canal opens lingually and increasingly expands as it trends posteriorly providing space for a large splenial. Where preserved (e.g., TMM 45947-529, 530) the subdental lamina varies in thickness; it appears deeper in more anterior portions of the dentary as in Prototeius, Meniscognathus, Leptochamops, Chamops and Socognathus (e.g., Estes, 1964; Denton and O'Neill, 1995; Gao and Fox, 1996; Longrich et al., 2012a Longrich et al., , 2013 . In the presumed anterior dentary fragment (TMM 45947-528), an upturning of the subdental lamina is evident, the teeth become shorter, and Meckel's canal narrows as it approaches the (unpreserved) symphysis. The premaxillary fragment (TMM 45947-527) is from the medial portion of a left maxilla but it is not very informative for that element. The labial surface is smooth and has the remains of a single labial foramen. What remains of the supradental shelf is broken. It is relatively shallow compared to the subdental shelf in this taxon. A similar disparity can also be seen in Chamops segnis and (seemingly) Mensicognathus altmani (Estes, 1964) . TMM 45947-527 bears two complete teeth as described above with the distalmost having a pronounced resorption pit at its base.",

                "text": "Remarks. This indeterminate taxon exhibits several morphologies which clearly pertain to Borioteiioidea including; 1) pleurodont teeth attached with cementum, 2) presence of deep replacement pits at tooth bases, and 3) a wide, lingually-open Meckel's groove. In general, this morph is similar to Leptochamops which suggests that they share a close taxonomic relationship. On the other hand, it possesses an eccentric dentition unique among Cretaceous, 'teiidlike' scincomorphans and the lack of cusplets, cristae, and striae on the crowns of the indeterminate form indicate that it and Leptochamops are likely not even members of the same genus. Therefore, we suggest the possibility that the specimens ascribed to this indeterminate borioteiioidean may have been consumed and digested prior to deposition. Although we find no evidence of the \"dissolved\" condition described by Estes (1964, p. 108) in several Chamops segnis specimens, we agree with Waldman (1970) that such a depositional context is certainly plausible. In fact, among the preserved crowns in our indeterminate borioteiioidean, the collective absence of ornamentation and irregularly tapered structure suggest that perhaps the gingiva resisted digestion and protected the subgingival tooth while the crowns eroded. Interestingly, almost identical but chaotic crown forms are known from paracontemporaneous lizard specimens from the Kaiparowits Formation of Utah (R. Nydam, pers. comm.) . As such, we suggest that either; 1) our indeterminate borioteiioidean could pertain to one or more of the taxa reported herein, or 2) that this condition may represent normal crown wear in a presently unknown, southern borioteiioidean species. Presently, the cause and potential taxonomic significance of this condition remains obscure.",

As in \"teiids\", a moderate amount of cementum is present along the base of an exposed tooth on TMM 49547-534 and several others exhibit large resorption pits at their bases (Fig. 7B ). The crowns in H. gladius are very weakly tricuspid and similar in form to the Late Cretaceous iguanomorphs Pariguana and Lamiasaura (Longrich et al., 2012a (Longrich et al., , 2013 DeMar et al., 2017) . They are not recurved and (diagnostically) bottle-shaped as in Lamiasaura, nor are the cusplets set apart from the main cusp by grooves as in Pariguana. The crowns in H. gladius also differ a bit from those in Bothriagenys where they are truly unicuspid. Otherwise, they similarly possess low cristae mesialis and distalis which wrap lingually around the crown generally as in all three aforementioned taxa. Only in B. flectomendax are the associated culmina lateris nearly as long (Fig. 7F) . In any case, the cristae in H. gladius are certainly more subtle than in Chamops and Leptochamops where well-developed cristae usually bear considerably more prominent cusplets. The lingual surfaces of crowns in H. gladius are weakly striated as in B. mysterion; however, the striae dominans are not nearly as well defined. Hence, the crown possesses only a subtle pars furcata which terminates at its apex. As such, the cuspes lingualis and labialis are not similarly separated so the crown lacks the apical 'saddle' seen in Bothriagenys. Although Pariguana and Lamiasaurus also bear similar lingual striae, both altogether lack pars furcata as figured or described by Longrich et al. (2012a Longrich et al. ( , 2013 . The two premaxillary fragments are not very informative. Both seemingly pertain to left premaxillae. Each fragment bears a single complete tooth, and the remains of two or three more. The interdental spaces are obscured by matrix so the presence of cementum cannot be determined; otherwise, the teeth exhibit no appreciable differences from those described above.",

It is much wider than in Pariguana and seemingly than in the holotype of Lamiasaura (UW 25116A) where the lingual margin appears somewhat eroded (Longrich et al., 2012a sup. mat., fig. S9 ). Furthermore, the subdental lamina in H. gladius is much shallower than in Bothriagenys where Meckel's canal opens ventrally throughout most of the dentary and the lamina is uniformly deeper as a result (Nydam, 2002) . TMM 45947-533 (holotype) preserves the mediodistal portion of Meckel's canal along with the ventral margin of the dentary lateral wall. Here, as in Bothriagenys, Meckel's canal opens ventrally but, although narrow, it is not slot-like (Fig. 7C) . The subdental lamina is shelf like, wide, and extends almost horizontally in the posteriormost portion of the fragment but rapidly narrows as it trends anteriorly. As preserved in TMM 45947-533, the lateral wall of the dentary in this area is so shallow that Meckel's canal was likely not open to the degree seen in many \"teiids\" (e.g., Estes, 1983) .

TMM 45947-540 presumably belongs to a medial left maxilla; however, it is not morphologically informative for that element. The two preserved teeth exhibit massive bases that are not labiolingually compressed and both exhibit evidence of cementum. Due to breakage and the presence of matrtix, it cannot be determined if tooth bases extended to the supradental lamina (or subdental lamina as diagnosed for A. triptodon). Each base exhibits a large resorption pit. Heavily striated tooth crowns of cf. A triptodon are strongly convex in lingual view, generally round in occlusal view, and have well developed cristae mesialis and distalis as in A. triptodon. In lingual view, tooth shafts of TMM 45947-540 are slightly swollen and there is a narrow, minutely striated 'collar' at the base of each preserved crown identical to 'collars' exhibited by similarly unworn teeth of A. triptodon as well as an unnamed ?scincid (OMNH 30872 and 30885) figured by Nydam et al.

In fact, the presence of antra in the unnamed ?scincid is more akin to crowns in C. solaster than to A. triptodon. The various similarities among the three forms noted above and also by Nydam et al.

                "text": "Description. These indeterminate scincomorphans consists of two specimens that superficially resemble one another (Fig. 7GeJ) ; however, both are so fragmentary that any conclusions regarding their taxonomic affinities remain unresolved. For now, we will include them together in the following description and note dissimilarities where applicable. Both fragments seemingly pertain to medial dentaries. The crowns in TMM 45947-542 extend somewhat further beyond the lateral parapet than those in TMM 45947-543. Teeth in both specimens are generally pleurodont, have generally columnar shafts and crowns, and are somewhat labiolingually compressed. One of the teeth in TMM 45947-542 exhibits a resporption pit at its base (Fig. 7G ), but although matrix obscures some of the subdental lamina in both specimens, neither exhibits basal cementum as commonly seen in \"teiids\". As opposed to the erect teeth in TMM 45947-542, those in TMM 45947-543 are gently inclined. If from the same taxon, this circumstance may be due to positional differences. The crowns in both specimens are bicuspid as in Paramacellodus and many \"teiids\" but they are unstriated and do not show evidence of having distinct cristae mesialis and distalis as in those forms (e.g., Estes, 1983; Gao and Fox, 1996; Nydam et al., 2007; Nydam, 2013) . Crown cuspules are not pronounced as are the true cusplets seen in Chamops and Leptochamops (hence the term cuspule in this case). However, crowns in our specimens are similar to more mesial crowns in Orthrioscincus where there is both a low mesial cusp and a higher distal cusp (Gao and Fox, 1996) . In TMM 45947-542 the main cuspule seems somewhat rounded as in Orthrioscincus; however, in TMM 45947-543 crown apices are somewhat damaged and they would have been a bit more pronounced. This difference in height creates a step-like appearance also seen in Early Cretaceous taxa Paramacellodus keebleri and cf. P. keebleri (Nydam and Cifelli, 2002b; Oreska et al., 2013) (Fig. 7J ) although these latter forms possess distinct anguli distalis where none exists in our indeterminate specimens. On both the lingual and labial sides of TMM 45947-542 and -543, situated between the cuspules are poorly developed fossae which connect on tooth apices forming narrow saddles. Here, the mesial cuspule is somewhat offset lingually giving the crowns a similarly rotated appearance in occlusal view as in P. keebleri. The preserved portions of the dentaries are not very informative in either specimen. TMM 45947-543 is badly damaged and what remains is obscured by matrix. In TMM 45947-542, the subdental lamina is shallow, narrow, and without a distinct sulcus dentalis as in Orthrioscincus but unlike Paramacellodus where it is deeper (Estes, 1983; Gao and Fox, 1996) . The orientation and degree of openness of Meckel's canal in TMM 45947-543 is unclear.",

Hence, it is more likely that these two specimens pertain to species where the number of cusps varied throughout the jaw as in some \"teiids\". On the other hand, neither specimen exhibits cementum or defined cristae mesialis and distalis common to that clade. We also note that in some heterodont forms (e.g., Crocodilurus, Meniscognathus, Haptosphenus) the degree of cuspidity can vary positionally with unicuspid mesial teeth becoming bi-and even tricuspid within the same jaw (Estes, 1964) . Therefore, if these specimens pertain to a heterodont borioteioiidian, the number of cusps preserved in the crowns of these two specimens may be of limited taxonomic value. Although provisionally grouped into a single indeterminate speceis, there are enough differences between these two specimens to suggest that they each could pertain to distinct scincid or \"paramecellodid\"/cordylid grade taxa. Thus, we refer them both to indeterminate scincomorphans.",

Xenosauridae (\u00bcXenosaurinae sp. of Miller, 1997) noting their sculptural similarities to (fused) maxillary osteoderms of Exostinus lancensis from the Maastrichtian of Wyoming and Montana (Gao and Fox, 1996, p. 63) where the maxilla is described as being \"extensively ornamented with flattened patches of vermiculate sculpture that are separated by shallow grooves\" (fig.  27A) . A similar condition was described by Miller (1997) for osteoderms fused to a left maxilla specimen (OMNH 25337) also from the same locality as Nydam et al.'s osteoderms. However, according to Nydam et al. (2013) , this specimen (plus another) has since been lost, and as figured, a confident taxonomic referral of the specimen cannot be made. In any case, we agree with Nydam et al. (2013) that the osteoderms reported both from the upper shale member of the Aguja Formation as well as those described herein have more widely open grooves between the ridges than E. lancensis and so likely represent a distinct taxon. We also point out that Nydam et al.'s tentative referral involving loose osteroderms is somewhat strengthened by the seeming presence at the Terlngua locality of the aforementioned fragmentary xenosaurine maxillae. Hence, the referral of our isolated, fragmentary specimens to ?Xenosauridae reflects somewhat more doubt.",

Aside from many shed crowns pertaining to Dryadissector shilleri (Wick et al., 2015) , six additional varanoid (sensu Lee, 1997) teeth and small jaw fragments were recovered at Lowerverse. All are fragmentary or abraded but are characteristically pleurodont and possess basal plicidentine infoldings as in other varanoids (Fig. 9AeG) . None of the specimens exhibit serrations as in D. shilleri (Wick et al., 2015) . Where preserved in most specimens, tooth bases generally grade smoothly onto tooth-bearing surface of jaws as in paracontemporaneous Laramidian forms Parasaniwa wyomingensis, cf. P. wyomingensis, and \"Parasaniwa, new species\" (e.g., Gilmore, 1928; Gao and Fox, 1996, fig. 33; Aguillon-Mart\u00ednez, 2010; Nydam et al., 2013) . A single, nearly complete tooth (TMM 45947-544) (Fig. 9A ) exhibits a somewhat raised 'step' at its point of attachment as well as trenchant and striated flanges similar to those seen in Primaderma nessovi (Nydam, 2000) . We note, however, that these are not the same structures as venom grooves present in helodermatids (e.g., Yatkola, 1976; Yi and Norell, 2013) . Similar trenchant flanges are present on teeth in D. shilleri where they are positionally variable in form (Wick et al., 2015, Fig. 7) .",

However, the varanoid specimens illustrated here represent roughly three size classes suggesting that, aside from D. shilleri, there are as many as two additional varanoid taxa within the Lowerverse local fauna. In any case, based on similarities in architecture of tooth bases and presence of plicidentine, the closest comparison of these fragmentary specimens is with Parasaniwa. However, we stop short of any referral as the specimens from Lowerverse are too fragmentary to characterize. Therefore, unlike D. shilleri which has a comparatively large analytical sample (Wick et al., 2015) , we regard the grouped specimens described here as likely pertaining to several small, indeterminate varanoids pending the discovery of more diagnostic material.

In any case, all of the specimens are similar enough to Coniophis trunk vertebrae described and illustrated elsewhere by numerous authors (e.g., Marsh, 1892; Gilmore, 1938; Fox, 1975; Rage, 1998; Holman, 2000; Longrich et al., 2012b; Nydam, 2013; Smith, 2013; Caldwell et al., 2015) that further detailed description here is unnecessary. However, only one of the study specimens (TMM 45947-554) exhibits a pronounced haemal 'keel' as in the holotype (USNM 2134 , Marsh, 1892 Gilmore, 1938) so both presumably belong to the anteriormost trunk. Others appear more like Coniophis sp. from the Cerro del Pueblo Formation of northern Mexico (SEPCP 18/201, 202; Aguillon-Mart\u00ednez, 2010, fig. 11) where the keel is reduced suggesting that it pertains to a more posterior position. In any case, the form of the haemal keel and associated central bony ridge on trunk vertebrae in C. precedence is positionally variable (Longrich, 2012b; Caldwell et al., 2015) ; hence, not diagnostically useful as applied to the holotype of 'Coniophis cosgriffi' from New Mexico (MNA PL 1612; Armstrong-Zeigler, 1978) . Furthermore, none of our specimens exhibit a comparatively narrow, protruding zygosphene or comparatively elevated neural ridge as in 'C. cosgriffi'. We also refer the reader to Holman (2000) for additional comments regarding Armstrong-Zeigler's referral and agree that MNA PL 1612 likely does not pertain to Coniophis. Remarks. Coniophis is the only \"anilioid\" taxon recognized in the Late Cretaceous North American fossil record (Smith, 2013) ; however, our referral of specimens to aff. Coniophis is a very cautious one. \"Anilioid\" snakes are predominantly burrowing species whose trunk vertebrae may be broadly characterized, for example, by depressed, saddle-shaped neural arches, low or absent neural spines, and high-angled prezygapophyses among others (Smith, 2013; Head, 2015) . The fragmentary nature of the Lowerverse snake specimens and their partial obscuration by matrix precludes a definitive referral. However, they concord in form and size with Coniophis reported from elsewhere from the Late Cretaceous Westertn Interior of North America. That being said, we also recognize that Coniophis (sensu lato) may represent a wastebasket taxon for \"fossorial ecomorphs\" (Head and Holroyd, 2008) and we agree with Head (2015) that snake vertebral morphology may have limited value as it relates to the referral of similar vertebral specimens to this seemingly generalized form genus (see Head and Holroyd, 2008; Smith, 2013; Head, 2015 for useful discussions in this regard). In any case, given the local depositional context and admixture of species within the Lowerverse deposits, it is exceedingly unlikey that these specimens pertain to just a single animal and much more likely that multiple individuals of aff. Coniophis sp. are represented. It is also possible that they represent multiple, closely-related species.",

Furthermore, its low posterior maxillary process is akin to that in Hypostylos gen. nov. Both TMM 45947-550 and Hypostylos similarly exhibit rather robust teeth. However, they are considerably disparate in form; teeth in Hypostylos are columnar and low crowned while that in TMM 45947-550 is conical and extends considerably further past the dental parapet.

Thus, it is also possible that they were digested prior to burial (e.g., see the indeterminate borioteiioidean described above). Teeth are rather broad mesiodistally. They are closely spaced and (where unobscured by matrix) join just above their points of attachment. In lingual aspect the tooth shafts are oddly irregular; one is almost sinuous in appearance (Fig. 9J) . Furthermore, tooth bases are labiolingually expanded forming a buttress on the dental lamina. Careful examination of the specimen (after imaging) revealed that a replacement pit had formed directly below the shaft of the centermost tooth; however, it is largely obscured by matrix. The subdental lamina is fractured and so the width of the sulcus dentalis cannot be determined but it seems to have been shallow.",

The teeth are fully pleurodont with smooth, slightly recurved crowns extending about 1/3 of their length beyond the lateral parapet. Basal cementum is absent. Crowns vary slightly in appearance but all are labiolingually compressed and have a minor lingual deflection. As preserved, tooth bases are rather wide mesiodistally which gives the teeth a triangular outline in lingual view. The teeth contact each other about >1/3 of their distance above the subdental lamina. The lamina is shallow but moderately wide with a poorly developed sulcus dentalis. The remnant of the ventrolabial surface of the dentary suggests that Meckel's canal was open medially in this portion of the element and it is separated from the inferior alveolar canal by a thin lamina of bone.",

The teeth in TMM 45947-552 are smooth, closely spaced, and triangular in lingual view as in similarly-aged and Kaiparowits Formation Morphotype G (KFmG) (Nydam, 2013) and 'Alocosaurus johnstoni' (Gao, 1992) . However; they are not recurved and subpleurodont as in KFmG, nor are they nearly subacrodont as in 'A. Johnstoni'. Moreover, both of these forms have comparatively deeper subdental laminae so it is very unlikely that TMM 45947-552 pertains to either one. However, in several ways this morph most resembles the enigmatic holotype of 'Lanceosaurus hatcheri' (USNM 10701; Gilmore, 1928 ; see Gao and Fox, 1996 for a discussion) given that it similarly bears transversely compressed teeth with wide bases and smooth, obtusely pointed crowns. TMM occlusal and (L) lingual views. Small circles indicate presumed anterior direction of specimen. Abbreviations: (fpr) facial process; (lab) labial foramen; (pmp) post maxillary process; (rep) replacement tooth. Common scale bar for A-G \u00bc 1 mm; all other scale bars \u00bc .5 mm. 45947-552 differs from USNM 10701 in that it seemingly has a shallower subdental lamina, exhibits teeth which are pleurodont in attachment rather than in the subpleurodont manner alluded to in USNM 10701 by Gilmore (1928) , and has a comparatively more open Meckel's canal as in chamopsiids (Estes, 1964; Gao and Fox, 1996) . Indeed, USNM 10701 was synonymized with Chamops segnis by Estes (1964, p. 108) who interpreted the absence of crown ornamentation ostensibly as the result of digestive erosion but otherwise likened it to that taxon. In this case, we find no apparent evidence of digestive erosion. The broad mesiodistal bases and pleurodont teeth in this specimen also suggest that there were comparatively few, large teeth in the dental arcade as in some (non-amblyodont) Late Cretaceous and Paleogene amphisbaenians (e.g., Smith, 2009a; Folie et al., 2013; Cernansky et al., 2015; Longrich et al., 2015; Berkovitz and Shellis, 2017) . Indeed, TMM 45947-552 does exhibit teeth similar to some amphisbaenians (e.g., Blanus) which similarly has conical, weakly recurved teeth with labiolingually compressed crowns (Georgalis et al., 2018) . In any case, TMM 45947-552 likely pertains to a taxon other than described elsewhere herein from Lowerverse.",

The first of these, the Terlingua local fauna (Rowe et al., 1992) , was collected from a locality just outside of the town of Terlingua, TX very near Big Bend National Park and the second, the Talley Mountain local fauna (Sankey, 1998) , from near Talley Mountain within the park itself (Fig. 1) . Although geographically somewhat disparate (ca. 37 km apart), these two sites are situated at nearly the same stratigraphic interval within the lowermost upper shale and both are comprised of coastal marsh and swamp deposits. However, these facies are not as well developed at either locality as at Lowerverse (Lehman, 1985a; Davies and Lehman, 1989; Rowe et al., 1992; Sankey, 1998 Sankey, , 2008 Lehman et al., 2019) .

Whatever the case, these three localities have produced diverse assemblages which collectively represent a reasonable account of the squamate taxa present within a relatively narrow, early-middle Campanian stratigraphic interval (Fig. 1) . These circumstances provide a useful opportunity to study the temporal transition of southern squamate faunas having developed locally and within corresponding environs.

This tentative referral is further supported by the three seeming chamopsiids described herein establishing the likely presence of chamopsiids at Lowerverse. If so, apart from the three indeterminate chamopsiids described herein, the upper shale fauna has conclusively produced but a single unique scincomorphan e Peneteius; a taxon also reported from the late Campanian Cerro del Pueblo Formation of Northern Mexico (Aguillon-Mart\u00ednez, 2010). Conversely, three scincomorphan forms are credibly shared between both faunas including the likely xantusiid Catactegenys solaster, the indeterminate scincomorphan Apsgnathus triptodon, as well as at least one indeterminate chamopsiid (we note that three chamopsiids are seemingly present at Lowerverse and so one or two of these are likely distinct from the one reported from the upper shale).

Copious remains pertaining to one of these (D. shilleri) suggests that it was a dominant mesopredator within the local environment (Wick et al., 2015) . Anguimorphs in the upper shale fauna are more diverse. Aside from the questionable presence of an inderminate glyptosaurine (LSUMG 140:6106; Sankey, 1998 Sankey, , 2008  informally referred herein to the scincomorph H. lehmani gen.et sp. nov.), anguimorphs are convincingly represented by three forms including the anguid Odaxosaurus piger, a likely xenosaurid, as well as (poorly represented) varanoids such as cf. Parasaniwa wyomingensis (although it is possible that this species is also among the indeterminate varanoids also reported from Lowereverse). Interestingly, unlike the Lowerverse assemblage, varanoid remains are comparatively rare at Terlingua and absent at Talley Mountain. The presence of cf. Coniophis at Lowerverse is analogous to the Terlingua locality where a similarly diminutive, but indeterminate snake (represented by fragmentary jaws) is also present. Snakes were not found at Talley Mountain. Overall, the Aguja Formation exhibits a marked reduction in lizard diversity from early to middle Campanian time.",

Conclusions based upon fragmentary specimens ascribed to ostensibly 'known' taxa can also be unreliable. In the realm of microvertebrate paleontology, a comprehensive inventory of all species present at a specific location may be an almost unattainable goal in practical applications.

The Wahweap Formation (in part Aquilan in age) exhibits remarkably lower squamate diversity (three taxa) than the lower shale member of the Aguja Formation at Lowerverse (also Aquilan) where as many as 18 taxa are present. However, the somewhat younger (Judithian) Kaiparowits Formation (as many as 21 taxa) is somewhat more speciose than Lowerverse. However, it is much more so than the (combined) lizard fauna produced from the similarly-aged, basal portion of the Aguja upper shale member exposed at Terlingua and Talley Mountain (10 taxa). The decrease in lizard diversity observed in the early-middle Campanian Aguja Formation is at odds with that seen in southern Utah where, over the same period, lizard diversity markedly increased.

However, both complexes share: Bothriagenys, Coniophis, Odaxosaurus, Parasaniwa, Penetius, and quite possibly chamopsiids such as Chamops and/or Leptochamops. It is also likely that a number of these genera may include unique, sub-provincial species as does Bothriagenys (B. mysterion of southern Utah versus B. flectomendax of West Texas). Although the diminutive snake Coniophis is present in all three formations, it is represented by vertebrae so it is possible that several \"anilioid\" species are present. Snakes are not known from north of approximately 45 north during the late Campanian so they appear to have been restricted to southern Laramidia (Nydam et al., 2013) . With as many as 10 individuals represented at Lowerverse, Coniophis seems to also have been comparatively more abundant here than elsewhere in southern Laramidia. However, its presence in considerably older (AlbianeCenomanian) strata in southern Utah (Gardner and Cifelli, 1999) thus far suggests a northerly origin and southern dispersal for the species. However, it now seems that small fossorial snakes like Coniophis were well established in southernmost Laramidia by early Campanian time e somewhat earlier than implied by various late Campanian occurrences (Armstrong-Ziegler, 1978; Aguillon-Mart\u00ednez, 2010; Nydam, 2013) . The above differences involving southern intra-provincial diversity are noteworthy.

Why opposing trends involving overall Campanian squamate diversity co-occurred in southern Utah and West Texas is unknown. By middle Campanian time, a long-term period of global cooling was underway culminating in Cretaceous temperature minima during the Maastrichtian (Huber et al., 1995) . The result was a progressive drop in sea level along with rapid easterly progradation of the shoreline of the Western Interior Seaway. During the Late Cretaceous, eustatic influences are thought to have played an increasingly significant role concerning the isolation, dispersal, and diversification of some vertebrate clades (e.g., Loewen et al., 2013) .",

Anguimorphs are also well-represented as is a Coniophis-like snake. The occurrence of several additional indeterminate lizards (all unique to Lowerverse) completes this diverse southern squamate fauna. During early to middle Campanian time, stark taxonomic differences observed among squamates from somewhat younger strata of West Texas as well as paracontemporaneous strata of southern Utah indicate that squamate communities evolved differently in both areas. Campanian Laramidian ecosystems appear to have been characterized by high beta diversity and basin-scale endemism among some vertebrate species with evidence for higher-order segregation of these into northern and southern provinces (e.g., Lehman, 1997 Lehman, , 2001 Gates et al., 2010; Sampson et al., 2010; Loewen et al., 2013; contra Vavrek and Larson, 2010) . The current work reveals that similar, latitudinally-arrayed quarters of endemism also existed among sub-provincial squamate faunas within the southern biogeographic province of the Western Interior.",

In Bothriagenys, Meckel's canal appears as a narrow, ventrally-open slot throughout most of its trend along the jaw. In spite of these differences, there are enough morphological similarities to suggest possible affinities among these taxa. The presence of B. mysterion and B. flectomendax in the Aguja Formation represents the first definitive record of two co-occurring species of Bothriagenys in the Western Interior of North America.If B. mysterion and Kaiparowits Formation Morphotype A of Utah indeed represent the same taxon as implied byNydam (2013) and reported here (and in spite of their temporal separation), similar co-occurrences involving Bothriagenys likely occurred elsewhere in Laramidia during the Late Cretaceous."
