It is likely that these remains pertain to Alamosaurus sanjuanensis or a closely related species (Gilmore, 1922; 1946) . A. sanjuanensis is thus far the only titanosaur recognized from Upper Cretaceous strata in North America (e.g., Lucas and Hunt 1989; Lucas and Sullivan, 2000; Lehman and Coulson, 2002; Woodward and Lehman, 2009; D'Emic et al. 2010; Fowler and Sullivan 2011; Fronimos and Lehman, in press) . Although some authors have questioned the taxonomic status of A. sanjuanensis, Wilson and D'Emic (2011) and D'Emic et al. (2011) presented a compelling argument in favor of its validity. Even so, referral of fragmentary titanosaur specimens to Alamosaurus has been problematic because its key apomorphic features are found only in a few skeletal elements (e.g., scapula). As a result, specimens lacking elements that overlap with the A. sanjuanensis hypodigm are doubtfully attributed. This is the case for the complete titanosaur femur recently collected from the Javelina Formation described below.",

The exposed part of the Javelina Formation at 'Willow' is 65 m thick. The lower part of the formation here is truncated by faulting, and the upper part is largely covered by alluvium. For comparison, complete sections of the Javelina Formation nearby are 120 m (Dawson Creek) and 133 m (Pe\u00f1a Mountain; Lehman et al. in prep.) . An exposure up-dip from the 'Willow' locality is near the contact with the overlying Black Peaks Formation, and indicates that the section here exposes the upper portion of the Javelina.

The proximolateral corner of TMM 46052-1 is sharply defined, resulting in an angle of approximately 115 between the lateral margin of the shaft and the dorsal surface of the greater trochanter, and is similar in this regard to Aeolosaurus sp. (Garcia and Salgado, 2013) . Also as in Aeolosaurus sp., the abductor crest (\u00bc\"lateral bulge\" of authors) is reduced, and occupies approximately one-fourth of the proximolateral surface of the bone. On TMM 46052-1, the lateral margin of the shaft is deflected at the apex of the abductor crest, resulting in an angle of approximately 155 . The abductor crest projects laterally 6.5 cm from a straight line connecting the lateral terminus of the greater trochanter to a point along the lateral margin of the shaft where it reaches its minimum mediolateral width of 24.5 cm. The ratio between the two measurements is 0.265, a value less than in most other titanosaurids where it is typically above 0.30 (character 19 of Salgado et al., 1997) . On its lateral and posterior surfaces, the abductor crest exhibits longitudinal attachment scars for the abductor musculature. Posteriorly, the abductor crest is delineated from the remainder of the shaft by a long, prominent trochanteric shelf similar to that described for Neuquensaurus and Lirainosaurus (Otero, 2010; D\u00edaz et al., 2013) .",

Curry-Rogers (2009) recognized that femoral morphology is very similar among most titanosaurs, but variations occur in the morphology of the abductor crest, shape of femoral head, and development of the distal condyles; however, TMM 46052-1 deviates from the norm in all three aspects of femoral morphology noted by Curry-Rogers (2009) . First, TMM 46052-1 exhibits a less elevated femoral head compared to most other titanosaurs. Second, it exhibits a comparatively low abductor crest. Third, and most significantly, it retains a transverse distal joint surface that is orthogonal to the long axis of the bone. In other titanosaurids, the medial condyle is positioned somewhat elevated to the lateral condyle requiring that the femur be held outwardly in order to properly articulate with the tibia during ambulation e a posture developed in response to the redistribution of body mass during \"wide-gauge\" locomotion (Wison and Carrano, 1999; Wilson, 2002; Curry-Rogers, 2005; Salgado et al., 2005; Curry-Rogers, 2009; Vila et al., 2013) . Curry-Rogers (2005, character 338) coded Alamosaurus as possessing a dorsomedially-beveled distal condylar surface; however, this morphology is clearly not exhibited by TMM 46052-1. The unbeveled distal morphology in TMM 46052-1 is similar to that in less derived somphospondylians (e.g., Ligabuesaurus, Euhelopus) where hindlimb stance was closer to vertical and the gait comparatively narrower.",

In two of the specimens (TTU 542, TMM41541-1), the distal end is completely restored in plaster.

Another specimen (UTEP P-25) appears to have a relatively narrow shaft and distal end, but this is likewise due to erosional loss of the lateral surface of the shaft and fibular condyle. These apparent differences are all attributable to incomplete preservation. Otherwise, in those specimens where comparable features are preserved, there are notable similarities: 1) the femoral head is not highly elevated above the greater trochanter; 2) where the greater trochanter, abductor crest, and minimum transverse shaft width are preserved, the abductor crest ratios are lower than in other titanosaurs (0.265 for TMM46052-1; 0.287 for AMNH FARB 21531, and 0.296 for TMM 41541-1; character 19 of Salgado et al., 1997) ; and 3) where the distal end is preserved (AMNH FARB 21531, UTEP P-25, and TMM 46052-1), the transverse distal joint surface is orthogonal to the long axis of the shaft (contra Curry-Rogers, 2005).

Among the five specimens, the summit of the abductor crest varies in its position along the lateral margin, but this does not appear to be related to size; both the smallest and largest specimens (AMNH FARB 21531, TMM 41541-1) exhibit a more distal placement. These two specimens also have a proportionally more robust proximal end (Fig. 3C ). Such differences might be attributable to sexual variation; however, these two specimens are both also from near the top of the Javelina Formation. In contrast, TMM 46052-1 is from the middle of the formation (c. 30 m lower), and although the precise stratigraphic positions of the other two specimens are unknown (TTU 542, UTEP P-25), both are likely from near the base of the formation. The general similarity of the five specimens, their occurrence in the same stratigraphic unit, and restricted geographic region (within c. 50 km of each other), suggests that they pertain to a single taxon; however, it remains possible that subtle morphological differences noted above may reflect stratigraphically successive species (e.g., Fronimos and Lehman, in press).",

This combination of character states in small as well as large femora suggests that throughout life, the Big Bend titanosaur retained a hindlimb morphology and stance less derived compared to other members of the clade. The outwardly angled femora and offset tibial condyle in derived titanosaurs is therefore not correlated with body size; the Big Bend titanosaur attained much larger size than many other titanosaurs, yet retained a plesiomorphic femur morphology. If TMM 46052-1 is attributable to Alamosaurus, then its femur morphology may offer additional means to diagnose the taxon. Recovery of similar femora in association with skeletal elements that exhibit features apomorphic for Alamosaurus (e.g., scapula, first caudal vertebra; D'Emic et al., 2011) may ultimately permit identification of TMM 46052-1 as well as the other Big Bend specimens.",
