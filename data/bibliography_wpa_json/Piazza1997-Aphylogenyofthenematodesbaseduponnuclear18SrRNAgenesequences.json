Acoelomates have no coelom; their mesoderm consists of a mass of tissue between the gut and body wall. Eucoelomates possess a true coelom, surrounded by a thin layer of mesoderm-derived cells called the peritoneum (Brusca and Brusca, 1990) . This peritoneum effectively separates the internal organs from the coelom. Coelomate animals are further divided into two major groups, protostomes and deuterostomes. Developmental differences distinguish these two divisions (Brusca and Brusca, 1990) . While protostome eggs divide by spiral cleavage, deuterostome eggs display radial cleavage. In protostomes, the blastopore eventually becomes the mouth, while in deuterostomes, this opening is fated to become the anus. l The coelom in protostomes is formed through the hollowing out of the mesoderm (schizocoely); the deuterostome coelom arises from the pinching off of gut diverticula (enterocoely). Brusca and Brusca (1990) recognize seven phyla as deuterostomes:",

To date, there is much debate on how these phyla should be placed into the overall evolutionary scheme of the animal kingdom. The classical view, taught in many general biology and zoology courses, presents a monophyletic origin of the pseudocoelomates (see Figure 1 ). Monophyly, according to Lorenzen (1983) is a condition in which several species arise from a single \"stem species.\" Viewed in this manner, the pseudocoelomates are often grouped together into a taxon collectively known as the Aschelminthes. Ruppert (1991) gives only two requirements for inclusion into this taxa: the presence of a pseudocoelom and a cuticle. Hyman (1951) considers Aschelminthes to be a phylum and all the pseudocoelomate taxa to be classes, while others take the Aschelminthes to be a superphylum. However the taxon Aschelminthes is interpreted, it suggests close evolutionary relationship among all pseudocoelomates.",

Poinar (1991) indicates the presence of specialized structures (e.g., setae and bristles) on the cuticles of some freshwater species, which aid in morphological classification. The pseudocoelom of a nematode is not spacious (Brusca and Brusca, 1990) ; internal organs occupy much of the coelomic space. Nervous and excretory systems in nematodes, as well as longitudinal muscles are well-developed, while respiratory and circulatory systems are rudimentary (Poinar, 1991) . The nervous system consists of several connected ganglia, including a cerebral ganglion. Nematode excretory systems can be of two types: an excretory duct and gland located ventrally, or a tube-like system of excretory canals, running longitudinally (Poinar, 1991) .",

In some species, they are located within the ring of anterior sensory papillae on the nematode's head (Poinar, 1991) . Exact amphid structure varies among taxa (Lorenzen, 1994) . Some nematode genera possess phasmids, caudally located sensory organs generally considered to be chemoreceptors (Brusca and Brusca, 1990) . Lorenzen (1994) considers phasmids to be less significant in a biological sense than the amphids.

Some of these characteristics were the size, shape, and position of the amphids, the presence or absence of other sensory organs (i.e., phasmids) and the presence or absence of somatic setae. The morphology of the \"lip\" region was also a determining factor in his analysis. Maggenti considered the ecological situations of the various groups, deemed an important characterizing factor by Croll and Matthews (1977) , to separate the nematodes into two classes, Adenophorea and Secementea. The absence of phasmids is the basis for the placement of a given species within Adenophorea; in contrast, members of Secementea possess phasmids. According to Maggenti (1981) , Class Adenophorea encompasses both free-living and parasitic nematodes which inhabit marine, freshwater, and terrestrial environments. Members of Class Secementea are almost exclusively terrestrial (Maggenti, 1981) . Croll and Matthews (1977) accept the two-class taxonomy, though they recognize significantly fewer orders than does Maggenti, and they also divide Phylum Nematoda into Adenophorea and Secementea. 1977; Maggenti, 1981; Malakhov, 1994) . Lorenzen (1983) reviews several earlier taxonomic systems which recognize the two-class system, as well as other classification schemes (notably Andrassy, 1976) which he rejects, that divide the phylum into three classes. Andrassy (1976 ( , reviewed by Lorenzen, 1983 divides Adenophorea into two groups, which Lorenzen believes are homologous enough to each warrant equal ranking with Secementea. Malakhov (1994) , who considers \"Nematoda\" to be a class, cites Enoplia, Chromadoria, and Rhabditia as subclasses within \"Nematoda\" rather than within \"Adenophorea\" or \"Secemetea,\" which he does not recognize. Interestingly, Malakhov (1994) traditional phylogenetic methods of phenetics and cladistics, which rely solely upon morphological data as their basis for classification. In phenetics, one examines as many characters as possible from different organisms to determine their relatedness; evolutionary consequences are largely ignored (Brusca and Brusca, 1990) . Cladistics is arguably a somewhat better classification method, as its basis is common ancestry (Coomans, 1983) . Groups of organisms are said to be related if they share common derived characteristics. Characters must be homologous (traceable to some common ancestor) rather than analogous (having similar structure and/or function but not traceable to some common ancestor) to be considered valid in cladistic analysis (Lorenzen, 1983 and Coomans, 1983) .",

Since each transcription event yields only one copy of the gene product (Singer and Berg, 1991) , the rRNA genes are present in multiple copy numbers on the chromosomes, forming long tandem arrays. The abundance of such genes allows for large amounts of product to be produced quickly. The genes coding for 18S, 5.8S, and 28S rRNAs are arranged in that order on the chromosome, as shown in Figure 5 . The eukaryotic 28S gene is approximately 4000 nucleotides long, and is referred to as a large subunit rRNA; the 18S gene measures approximately 1800-1900 nucleotides in length, and is referred to as the small subunit (SSU) rRNA (Winnepenninckx, et al. 1994) . The genes are separated ( Figure 5 ) by two noncoding regions called internal transcribed spacers (ITS 1 and 2, Hillis and Dixon, 1991) , which vary in length among species. Another noncoding region, the external transcribed spacer (ETS), is located-upstream of the 18S gene. A nontranscribed spacer (NTS) separates adjacent arrays. The three genes and three transcribed spacers make up a single RNA polymerase I transcriptional unit (Singer and Berg, 1991) , which is separated from other units by a non-transcribed spacer (NTS, Figure 5 , Hillis and Dixon, 1991 ).",

External nodes form the \"leaves\" of the tree and represent OTUs, while internal nodes are positioned at branching points (Swofford and Olsen, 1990) . In some types of phylogenetic trees, branch length is interpreted as the degree of divergence (represented by the number of nucleic acid substitutions) which have occurred in species since their branching. Nei (1987) discusses several classifications of phylogenetic trees. In a rooted tree, the topology is \"rooted\" with an organism which is believed to share a common ancestor with all OTUs. Most phylogenetic analyses, however, involve the generation of unrooted trees. These trees do not show the common ancestor, emphasizing solely the relationships among various OTUs (Swofford and Olsen, 1990) . A species tree depicts the evolutionary pathways taken by the various OTUs; a gene tree traces the pattern of divergence followed by a single gene obtained from different species. A gene tree and a species tree generated from the same OTUs will not necessarily possess the same topology (Nei, 1987) .",

A new matrix is constructed with this new unit, and the process is continued until all OTUs have been linked into a tree.

NJ is based upon the principle of minimum evolution; its objective is to find the tree with the shortest length, reflecting the least evolution. The NJ method has several merits over other distance matrix methods: it does not assume a constant evolutionary rate for all OTUs, it is applicable to any type of evolutionary distance data, and it provides evolutionary branch length as well as tree topology.

The present work is aimed at analyzing the relationships among the various nematode orders using molecular data. To do this, the 18S rRNA gene of representatives from two nematode orders were sequenced: Diplolaimelloides represents the order Monhysterida (Subclass Chromadoria), and Adoncholiamus represents Enoplida (Subclass Enoplia). These sequences were analyzed along with sequences obtained from representatives of other orders, which are either the products of previous work in this laboratory (Garey, unpublished data), or are available from GenBank. Neighbor-Joining trees were constructed using the Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) 25 software package (Kumar, et al., 1993) ; Felsenstien's (1995) Phylogenetic Inference Package (PHYLIP) was employed in the construction of Maximum Parsimony trees.",

Like the NJ tree, the strict-consensus tree (Figure 11 ) offers only weak support for the relative position of Enoplida. Malakhov (1994) indicates that, within Subclass Enoplia, Order Enoplida is taken to be the most primitive. His phylogeny (Figure 4b ), which indicates paraphyly within Enoplia, shows other orders (i.e., Trichocephalida and Mermithida) branching after Enoplida, following Enoplia's initial divergenece from Chromadoria. The primitive nature of Enoplida is not supported by molecular data. NJ analysis (Figure 9 ) indicates that the first nematode order to branch is Mermithida (represented by Me. nigrescens), followed by the sister taxa Enoplida and Trichocephalida. Parsimony analysis shows an initial branching of a Mermithida/ Trichocephalida clade, followed by Enoplida. Weak support is given to the position of Enoplida after these orders in both types of analysis.",
