This note was followed shortly thereafter by an article in the Contributions of the Museum of Paleontology of the University of Michigan that described the vertebrate fauna of beds in the Tecovas Formation near Walker's Tank, Crosby County, West Texas, of which T. buettneri was part (Case, 1928b) . Numerous authors have cited this University of Michigan article (Case, 1928b) as the publication in which T. buettneri is named. However, it is clear from the presence of the \"gen. and sp. nov.\" designation accompanying the line drawings in the Washington Academy of Sciences note (Case, 1928a ) that Case was in fact erecting the genus and species in that publication, not in the later University of Michigan article (Case, 1928b) . Both the original note (Case, 1928a) and the Trilophosaurus portion of the later faunal article (Case, 1928b) were based on a single maxillary fragment containing the transversely broadened teeth for which the genus is best known ( Fig. 2A-F) . The tricuspid nature of the teeth, with their symmetrically oriented central cusp, provided Case's impetus to name the taxon Trilophosaurus, or \"three crested (lophed) reptile.\"",

These localities contained predominantly Trilophosaurus buettneri remains, and so were designated Trilophosaurus quarries 1, 2, 3 and 3A. These quarries are located in the Colorado City Formation of the Chinle Group near Otis Chalk, Texas . The collections made by the WPA are housed primarily at the Texas Memorial Museum, Vertebrate Paleontology Laboratory at the University of Texas at Austin. These WPA collections have served as the primary material for nearly all research regarding Trilophosaurus buettneri. TMM personnel authorized exchanges of these fossils with other institutions, thus, most of the WPA collections are in Austin, but other specimens, including composite skeletons, are present at AMNH, UMMP, and USNM, among others.

Using material from all four quarries, he reconstructed the entire postcranial skeleton and produced a moderately detailed cranial reconstruction. The principal specimen that Gregory (1945) used to reconstruct T. buettneri is a nearly complete articulated skeleton (TTM 31025-140), missing only the skull anterior to the orbits, the left manus and portions of the tail. Also, Gregory (1945) reinterpreted Trilophosaurus as a protorosaur, whereas Case (1928a, b) had previously considered it a cotylosaur. This assignment of Trilophosaurus to the Protorosauria would not be challenged until the 1980s. Thus, for example, the information Kuhn (1969, p. 26, figs. 11-12) presented in his review of \"Trilophosauria\" (an ordinal term Romer, 1956 , introduced for Trilophosaurus and allied genera) came directly from Gregory (1945) .",

Zahnreihen is a system used to represent the timing of tooth replacement events. The term \"z-spacing\" refers to the number of tooth positions between teeth that exhibit the same degree of replacement. Typically, DeMar and Bolt (1981) used empty alveoli, which they interpreted as recently erupted teeth that had yet to attach to the jaw, in order to determine z-spacing. Examining numerous T. buettneri partial skulls and lower jaws from WPA quarry 1, they concluded: (1) Trilophosaurus has a mean z-spacing of about 5-6 tooth positions, with an overall range between 2.5 and 8 tooth positions; (2) individual teeth were in usable condition for at least 70%-75% of their life span; (3) the high percentage of useful life in the teeth was achieved by changes in the replacement process itself and by decreasing the rate of tooth replacement; (4) there was an ontogenetic change in tooth morphology, suggesting that juveniles were carnivorous, whereas adults were herbivorous; (5) dental occlusion was not highly developed, with little tooth-on-tooth wear, and teeth did not wear into occlusion; (6) evolution of long zspacing was made possible by the relatively long time the teeth remained in the tooth row; and (7) the reduction in tooth replacement rate may be related to maintaining the little occlusion that did exist. The conclusion of DeMar and Bolt (1981) that T. buettneri underwent ontogenetic change in tooth morphology was based on the interpretation that WPA quarry 1 individuals were adults, whereas WPA quarry 2 individuals were carnivorous juveniles. No subsequent workers, however, have considered the teeth of \"juvenile T. buettneri\" to be those of a carnivore. Murry (1987) described and named Trilophosaurus jacobsi based on a right mandible fragment ( Fig. 2G-J ) from the Placerias quarry near Romero Springs, 10.4 km southwest of St. Johns, Arizona (Lucas et al., 1997) . In addition, he referred three mandible fragments, two maxillary fragments and two isolated teeth to the taxon. According to Murry (1987) , the principal feature distinguishing the teeth of T. jacobsi from those of T. buettneri is the asymmetrically oriented central cusp and the prominent medial and lateral cingula on each cusp. Murry (1987) also noted that T. jacobsi is considerably smaller than T. buettneri.",

This is a questionable record, as no other occurrence of T. buettneri is known that is younger than late Adamanian. Recently, Heckert et al.

He noted that none of the teeth possess prominent cingula, thus reinforcing his assignment of the teeth to T. buettneri and not to T. jacobsi. Kaye and Padian (1994;  also see Tannenbaum, 1983 ) included Trilophosaurus sp. in their review of the microvertebrate fauna of the Placerias quarry, thus acknowledging the work of Murry (1987) . However, they considered the assignment of these teeth to Trilophosaurus as provisional because transversely expanded teeth of Late Triassic age can also pertain to procolophonids, sphenodontians and some other taxa, as noted by Fraser (1986) and Heckert et al. (2006) . Sues and Olsen (1993) , in the course of reviewing procolophonids from the Upper Triassic of Virginia, noted that Trilophosaurus jacobsi, as described by Murry (1987) , appeared more closely related to Tricuspisaurus and Variodens, both of which were considered procolophonids by Sues and Olsen (1993) . Thus, Sues and Olsen (1993) proposed a new generic name for T. jacobsi, Chinleogomphius, and interpreted it as a procolophonid.",

They also referred to this taxon an isolated tooth, incomplete left and right maxillae, left and right dentary fragments and a partial maxilla from various localities around the Post quarry collecting area in West Texas, which is in the Bull Canyon Formation. We do not consider T. dornorum to be distinct from T. jacobsi, for reasons discussed below. The importance of these specimens is that both the Bull Canyon Formation and the Sonsela Member of the Petrified Forest Formation are Revueltian in age, so these records represent the only known records of T. jacobsi in the Revueltian and are thus the youngest occurrences of the taxon. Spielmann et al. (2006b) reinterpreted the holotype of Malerisaurus langstoni (from Trilophosaurus quarry 2), originally described by Chatterjee (1986) as a protorosaur, as a chimera consisting principally of Trilophosaurus buettneri material. They restricted the holotype of M. langstoni to the skull fragments, which they synonymized with T. buettneri. Interestingly, Spielmann et al. (2006b) noted that the other species of Malerisaurus, M. robinsonae, from the Maleri Formation of India, appears to have a femur with a large and extensive internal trochanter, a feature that is known elsewhere in the Late Triassic solely in Trilophosaurus. Thus, they concluded that the holotype of M. robinsonae, also named and described by Chatterjee (1980) , may also include Trilophosaurus material. If portions of M. robinsonae indeed pertain to Trilophosaurus it would change the paleogeographic distribution of the genus from a taxon endemic to the southwestern United States to one that potentially lived across a broad portion of Pangea.",

Heckert (2004, p. 29 ) postulated three possible interpretations for the lack of isolated teeth: \"(1) Trilophosaurus did not actually live in the vicinity of the locality, but individuals were transported and buried with their dentitions relatively intact shortly after death; (2) iso- (2006) . lated Trilophosaurus teeth are highly distinct and may have been collected by crew members preferentially relative to other taxa; and (3) Trilophosaurus teeth may have been sufficiently worn by the time they were shed that they are generally unrecognizable.\" Of these three conclu-sions, Heckert (2004) suggested that the \"interplay of (2) and (3) is the most likely.\"",

The only exception to this is portions of the holotype of \"Malerisaurus langstoni\" (Spielmann et al., 2006b ).",

The collecting area these samples came from has traditionally been referred to as the \"Dying Grounds\" (see Heckert, 2004, p. 130, and Parker, 2002 , for a history of the term Dying Grounds). The Dying Grounds are stratigraphically high in the Blue Mesa Member, approximately 47 m above its base and 30 m below the overlying Sonsela Member (Heckert and Lucas, 2002b; Heckert, 2004; Parker, 2006; Woody, 2006) . The fauna of the Dying Grounds is part of the type assemblage of the Adamanian lvf and is latest Carnian in age (Lucas and Hunt, 1993a; Lucas, 1997 Lucas, , 1998 . Murry (1989a, b, fig. 7H ) first illustrated a single Trilophosaurus buettneri tooth from this site. This locality represents the stratigraphically highest unambiguous occurrence of T. buettneri teeth. However, Heckert (2004) did not recover any Trilophosaurus teeth from the site, even after extensive screenwashing. Thus, we conclude that Trilophosaurus teeth are extremely rare at this locality. Polcyn et al. (2002) included T. jacobsi in the faunal list of their North Stinking Springs site, near North Stinking Springs Mountain in Arizona. Unfortunately, the specimen was neither discussed nor illustrated. Based on photographs of the specimen, provided by Polcyn, we conclude that it is actually a T. buettneri tooth, not a T. jacobsi tooth. This site is in the Blue Mesa Member of the Petrified Forest Formation (Heckert et al., 2005) .",

Referred material: A complete list of referred material will be presented in Spielmann et al., in prep.Diagnosis: A species of Trilophosaurus distinguished from Trilophosaurus buettneri by the presence of prominent cingula linking the cusps both labiolingually across the center of the tooth and also along the mesial and distal margins of the tooth; the tooth is asymmetric in occlusal view, with the central cusp offset labially; the central cusp is asymmetric in occlusal view with a rounded, convex lingual margin and a more complex, steeper-sided, doubly concave labial margin; lingual cusp is low, transversely expanded and mesiodistally compressed; cervical vertebrae have no bifurcation of the postzygapophyses; cervical centra amphicoelous; single keeled sacral centra; prominent ridges on the sacral vertebrae extending from the posterior margin of the pre-and postzygapophyses to the base of the neural spine; length of the neural spine of sacral vertebrae less than half the length of the centrum; ectepicondyle rounded; ulnar condyle of the humerus larger than radial condyle; proximal femur is elliptical with a central depression; astragalus with rounded calcaneal articular surface; \"neck\" of astragalus thicker and taller than that of T. buettneri.Discussion: The distinct tooth morphology of each species of Trilophosaurus is documented in Heckert et al. (2006) . The osteology of Trilophosaurus jacobsi that we will report elsewhere (Spielmann et al., in prep.) allows for the first comparison of postcranial characters between the two species of Trilophosaurus, indeed, differences in the postcrania are evident within both the vertebral column and limbs. The pectoral and pelvic girdles of both species appear similar.Trilophosaurus \"dornorum:\" As noted above, Mueller and Parker (2006) named a new species of Trilophosaurus, T. dornorum, based on maxilla and dentary fragments from the Petrified Forest National Park, Arizona and the Post Quarry collecting area, West Texas. Muller and Parker (2006, p. 121) provided the following diagnosis of T. dornorum: \"medial and lingual cusps are similar in size and the medial cusp is offset labially. Cingula form deep grooves on larger specimens. Anterior and posterior cingula connecting both labial and lingual cusps to medial cusp, three to three and one-half maxillary teeth posterior to lateral process of maxilla. Maxilla and dentaries are more robust in structure than T. buettneri and T. jacobsi.\"Nevertheless, this diagnosis reveals no tangible reason why T. dornorum is distinct from T. jacobsi. The claim that medial and lingual cusps being similar in size distinguishes it from T. jacobsi is demonstrably incorrect: large, isolated maxilla and dentary fragments of T. jacobsi collected from the Kahle quarry show that the cusps become subequal in size in large individuals. Thus, we interpret the holotype of T. dornorum as belonging to a large individual of T. jacobsi. \"Cingula forming deep grooves in large specimens,\" is also true of these large specimens from the Kahle quarry, as is the cingula connecting both labial and lingual cusps to the medial cusp. The number of teeth posterior to the lateral flange (lateral process of Mueller and Parker [2006] ) should not be used as a diagnostic character, given the documented variation in the number of teeth in a tooth row (DeMar and Bolt, 1981) . Finally, the robustness of the specimen \"is not sufficient for taxonomic differentiation\" of T. dornorum, as readily admitted by Mueller and Parker (2006, p. 122) . Thus, all the features claimed by Muller and Parker (2006) as diagnostic of T. dornorum are also present in large individuals of T. jacobsi, so we synonymize T. dornorum with T. jacobsi, and consider the holotype and referred material of T. dornorum to be large individuals of T. jacobsi.",
