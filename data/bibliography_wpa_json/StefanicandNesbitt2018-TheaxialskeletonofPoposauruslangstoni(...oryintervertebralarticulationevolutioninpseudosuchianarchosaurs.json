    "abstract": "Dinosaurs and their close relatives grew to sizes larger than any other terrestrial animal in the history of life on Earth, and many enormous dinosaurs (e.g., Diplodocus, Spinosaurus, Tyrannosaurus) have accessory intervertebral articulations that have been suggested to support these large body sizes. Some pseudosuchian archosaurs have been reported to have these articulations as well, but few have been characterized in these taxa because of a lower abundance of complete, threedimensional pseudosuchian vertebral material in relation to dinosaurs. We describe the axial column of the large (\u223c4-5 m) poposauroid pseudosuchian Poposaurus langstoni from the Upper Triassic of Texas (TMM Locality 31025 of the Otis Chalk localities; Dockum Group, Howard County, TX, USA). P. langstoni was originally named from pelvic girdle elements and vertebrae; here we describe newly discovered and prepared presacral vertebrae and a presacral rib from the original excavation of the holotype in the 1940s. The well-preserved vertebrae have well-defined vertebral laminae and clear hyposphene-hypantrum intervertebral articulations, character states mentioned in pseudosuchians but rarely described. The new material demonstrates variation present in the hyposphene-hypantrum articulation through the vertebral column. We compared these morphologies to other pseudosuchians with and without the hyposphene-hypantrum articulation. Based on these careful comparisons, we provide an explicit definition for the hyposphene-hypantrum articulation applicable across Archosauria. Within Pseudosuchia, we find the hyposphene-hypantrum appeared independently in the clade at least twice, but we also see the loss of these structures in clades that had them ancestrally. Furthermore, we found the presence of large body sizes (femoral lengths >\u223c300 mm) and the presence of the hyposphene-hypantrum is correlated in most non-crocodylomorph pseudosuchian archosaurs with a few exceptions. This result suggests that the presence of the hyposphene-hypantrum is controlled by the increases and decreases in body size and not strictly inheritance.",

                "text": "The clade Archosauria, which includes extant birds and crocodylians, contains some of the largest land animals ever to exist (i.e., sauropod and theropod dinosaurs, Mazzetta, Christiansen & Fari\u00f1a, 2004; crocodyliforms, Sereno et al., 2001; rauisuchians, Nesbitt, Desojo & Irmis, 2013) , and to understand the consequence of body size on skeletal morphologies seen only in extinct taxa, we must turn to the fossil record. The appearance of large body sizes in Archosauria during the Mesozoic Era was accompanied by large variation in vertebral morphologies (Gauthier, 1986; Apesteguia, 2005; Wilson et al., 2016) . One example of a morphology present in dinosaurs that has been cited as associated with increased body size is an accessory intervertebral articulation known as the hyposphene-hypantrum articulation (Gauthier, 1986; Rauhut, 2003; Apesteguia, 2005) . In addition to the centrum faces and zygapophyses, this hyposphene-hypantrum articulation forms a \"lock-and-key\" configuration between consecutive vertebrae. More specifically, the hyposphene-hypantrum articulation consists of a ventrally expanded lamina of bone that is present at the junction of the postzygapophyses (=the hyposphene) that fits into a complementary space (=the hypantrum) that separates the prezygapophyses at the midline (Rauhut, 2003; Apesteguia, 2005) . In sauropod dinosaurs, the presence of these structures has been hypothesized to be related to increased vertebral column rigidity, thereby decreasing flexibility of locomotion (Apesteguia, 2005) .",

                "text": "Among dinosaurs, the hyposphene-hypantrum articulation is present in many clades with exceptionally large-bodied members such as derived sauropodomorphs and theropods (Wilson, 1999; Makovicky & Norell, 2004; Brusatte & Benson, 2008; Benson, 2010; Bandyopadhyay et al., 2010; Pol, Garrido & Cerda, 2011) , and it has been cited as a saurischian synapomorphy (Gauthier, 1986) because the articulation is not present in ornithischian dinosaurs. The hyposphene-hypantrum is also found to vary in shape and size relative to the rest of the neural arch in sauropods (Apesteguia, 2005) . The hyposphene-hypantrum articulation, however, is not restricted to saurischian dinosaurs, and descriptions of this vertebral feature have been reported in the close relatives of dinosaurs (Nyasasaurus parringtoni, Asilisaurus kongwe, Nesbitt et al., 2010) and in extinct archosaurs more closely related to crocodylians than to birds (Bonaparte, 1981; Azevedo, 1991; Weinbaum, 2013; Weinbaum & Hungerb\u00fchler, 2007; Parker, 2008; Nesbitt, 2005; Peyer et al., 2008; Gower & Schoch, 2009; Lautenschlager & Desojo, 2011; Nesbitt et al., 2014) . Although the hyposphene-hypantrum articulation is present in some paracrocodylomorphs (e.g., Poposaurus gracilis, Weinbaum & Hungerb\u00fchler, 2007; Arizonasaurus babbitti, Nesbitt, 2005; Postosuchus kirkpatricki, Postosuchus alisonae, Peyer et al., 2008; Prestosuchus chiniquensis, Azevedo, 1991; Fasolasuchus tenax, Bonaparte, 1981 ; Batrachotomus kupferzellensis, Gower & Schoch, 2009) , and in some aetosaurs (Desmatosuchus spurensis, Parker, 2008; Scutarx deltatylus, Parker, 2016b) , it is not present in extant crocodylians (Romer, 1956) . Previous work has not provided a comprehensive description of the hyposphene-hypantrum articulation across taxa or explored the possible homologies across archosaurs. Furthermore, the application of the term \"hyposphene-hypantrum\" to presacral vertebral morphology is inconsistent, and the variation of these structures, if any, is rarely reported. For each specimen described in a publication the presence or absence of a true hyposphenehypantrum articulation was left up to the interpretation of the author, and their verdict is typically unaccompanied by an explanation.",

                "text": "To explore the morphology of the hyposphene-hypantrum articulation in pseudosuchians, we describe the axial column of the large pseudosuchian Poposaurus langstoni from the Late Triassic of Texas. The holotype specimen of this species was collected in the early 1940s near Otis Chalk, TX, USA (TMM Locality 31025) from the Dockum Group (Long & Murry, 1995) . The holotype was erected solely based on the right ilium (TMM 31025-12) , but additional material comprising four presacral vertebrae (eighth cervical, pathologically fused ninth cervical and first trunk, and third trunk) and a right ischium was also referred to the same species by Long & Murry (1995) . Additional presacral vertebrae and most of a rib were collected from the same quarry as the holotype and previously referred material during the original excavation in the early 1940s; we attribute this material to P. langstoni and describe it herein for the first time because it has only been prepared recently. We also describe two vertebrae (TMM 31025-177, TMM 31025-257) in detail that were previously figured by Long & Murry (1995) , but not described in detail with the previously published material. The material of P. langstoni we describe here is of interest because it includes a variety of presacral vertebrae (four cervical, four trunk) from throughout the column, and it is preserved in three dimensions so that articulation surfaces are easy to discern. These characteristics are not present in most Triassic pseudosuchian fossils (e.g., Sillosuchus longicervix, PVSJ 85, Alcober & Parrish (1997) ; Ticinosuchus ferox, PIZ T 2817, Krebs (1965) ) because preservation is typically poor in Triassic-aged deposits. These vertebrae possess features that traditionally have been associated with saurischian taxa, including vertebral laminae (Wilson, 1999) and the hyposphene-hypantrum articulation (Apesteguia, 2005) , and help act as a benchmark for comparison with other pseudosuchians with similar structures.",

                "text": "We assign six presacral vertebrae to P. langstoni based on general morphology of their centra and neural arches, well-defined vertebral laminae, and an accessory rib articulation in the posterior cervical vertebrae (Figs. 2 and 3 ). These newly referred vertebrae share some character states with both of the previously described vertebrae of P. langstoni (Long & Murry, 1995; Weinbaum & Hungerb\u00fchler, 2007) . The posterior cervical vertebra of the newly referred material (TMM 31025-1261.3) possesses an accessory rib articulation adjacent to the parapophyses and lacks a ridge on the ventral surface of the centum, both features that link this material to previously referred material (TMM 31025-177) . This accessory rib articulation is a synapomorphy of the clade Poposauroidea (Nesbitt, 2005; Weinbaum & Hungerb\u00fchler, 2007) because it is also present in P. gracilis (TTU P-10419, Weinbaum & Hungerb\u00fchler, 2007) , and in another member of the clade, A. babbitti (MSM 4590, Nesbitt, 2005) . These newly referred vertebrae of P. langstoni also possess well-defined vertebral laminae that are also on vertebrae previously assigned to P. gracilis (TTU P-10419, Weinbaum & Hungerb\u00fchler, 2007) , as well as on the vertebrae of many saurischian dinosaurs such as Apatosaurus louisae and Allosaurus fragilis (Wilson, 1999) and other paracrocodylomorphs such as A. babbitti, Postosuchus sp., F. tenax, B. kupferzellensis, and P. chiniquensis (Nesbitt, 2005; Weinbaum, 2013; Bonaparte, 1981; Gower & Schoch, 2009; Azevedo, 1991) . The shape and morphologies of the centra and neural arches of the new material described here, including dorsoventrally elongate centrum facets, well-defined and pronounced laminae, and an accessory rib articulation on the cervical vertebrae, are also strikingly similar to that of P. gracilis (TTU P-10419, Weinbaum & Hungerb\u00fchler, 2007) and previously referred vertebrae of P. langstoni (TMM 31025-177, TMM 31025-257, TMM 31025-259, Long & Murry, 1995) . The presence of these features in these new vertebrae allows us to assign them to the genus Poposaurus; however, because the diagnostic characteristics that separate P. gracilis and P. langstoni are in the ilium and ischium (Long & Murry, 1995; Weinbaum & Hungerb\u00fchler, 2007) , we can only assign this material to P. langstoni by relying on the information that they were collected from the same quarry during the 1940 and 1941 excavations as the ilium and ischium that erected the species (unpublished WPA field notes, TMM).",

Each vertebra can be assigned to a presacral position within a range of two or three positions, depending on its general position among the other vertebrae preserved and based on comparisons with other archosaurs with more complete vertebral columns. For this specimen of P. langstoni, all the vertebrae were assigned general positions in the vertebral column mainly based on the position of the diapophyses, as they appear higher on the neural arch further posteriorly in the series as with P. gracilis (TTU-P 10419), Parringtonia gracilis (NMT RB426), and a number of specimens of Alligator mississippiensis (e.g., TMM M-12606). In P. langstoni, cervical vertebrae were identified by the presence of the parapophyses on the anterior rim of the centrum located anywhere from the base of the centrum to the base of the neural arch just ventral to the location of the neurocentral suture, whereas the parapophyses of trunk vertebrae are only present on the neural arch. The parapophyses migrate dorsally from the base of the centrum posteriorly along the tetrapod vertebral column (such as in P. gracilis and A. mississippiensis). Because the diapophyses are located on the neural arch in vertebrae posterior to presacral 7 in other paracrocodylomophs (e.g., P. gracilis, P. gracilis, A. mississippiensis) we can constrain the position of the anteriormost vertebra of P. langstoni (TMM 31025-1261.5) at presacral \u223c7 or 8. This vertebra also has a very slight ventral keel, which further constrains its position to presacral \u223c7 or 8 because this is characteristic of the most anteriorly located cervical vertebrae in other paracrocodylomorphs (e.g., P. gracilis).",

It also has a very slight ridge along the midline of the ventral surface of the centrum. The parapophyses on the lateral sides of this vertebra are located on the base of the anterior rim of the centrum and are lowest on the centrum relative to the other vertebrae and well separated from the diapophyses. The neural arch is fused to the centrum, and the neurocentral suture is nearly obliterated, but there is a slightly raised area with a distinctive texture on the lateral surface where the suture was originally present (Brochu, 1996) . In anterior view, the neural canal is circular and filled with matrix and in posterior view, the canal is obstructed by a large bivalve shell that based on general morphology, can be attributed to the freshwater mussel group Unionidae (Huber, 2010) (Figs. 2A and 2C) .",

On the lateral sides of TMM 31025-1261.5, there are clear anterior and posterior centrodiapophyseal laminae, which connect the diapophyses to their respective portions of the neurocentral junction. The paradiapophyseal lamina connects the parapophysis with the diapophysis, and is angled \u223c5 from vertical in lateral view. The postzygapophyseal laminae are well defined and connect the parapophyses and the lateral aspect of the postzygapophyses at about a 45 angle dorsal to the anteroposterior horizontal. This specimen is crushed so that the left postzygapophysis is pushed toward the diapophysis and this has compressed the lateral side of the left postzygapophyseal lamina ( Figs. 2A and 2C ). The prezygadiapophyseal laminae are laterally thick and the prezygapophyses and diapophyses are \u223c3 cm apart. These laminae extend dorsally from the diapophyses at a right angle to the anteroposterior horizontal with the prezygapophyses being dorsal to the diapophyses. The club-like diapophyses are fully intact where they connect to the neural arch, and the articular facets at their distal ends are elliptical. In posterior view, there are clear embayments present on the lateral sides of the transverse processes. A deep fossa is present on the left transverse process in anterior view (=prezygapophyseal centrodiapophyseal fossa of Wilson et al. (2011) ), but a symmetrical counterpart is not present on the right transverse process ( Figs. 2A and 2C ). There are epipophyses on the dorsal portion of the postzygapophyses that form a rugose structure about 0.2 cm from the end of the articular surface. The presence of epipophyses is typically cited as a synapomorphy of Dinosauria (Long & Murry, 1995; Langer & Benton, 2006; Langer, Ezcurra & Bittencourt, 2010; Novas, 1996) , but are known to occur within Pseudosuchia (Gower & Schoch, 2009; Bonaparte, 1981; Nesbitt, 2007 ; Revueltosaurus callenderi, PEFO 34561) and are found outside Archosauria among stem members (Nesbitt, 2011; Nesbitt et al., 2015) . There are interzygapophyseal laminae on the dorsal portion of the prezygapophyses connecting their lateral edge to the anterior extent of the postzygapophyses, a feature also found in Azendohsaurus madagaskarensis (FMNH PR 3823, Nesbitt et al., 2015) .",

It is further weathered so that the neural arch cannot be accurately reattached to the centrum in a close fit. Both postzygapophyses are broken off, and the neural spine is broken off near its base. This specimen can be attributed to presacral 11-13, as the parapophyses are well separated from the diapophyses, and the parapophyses are located at the junction of the neural arch and the centrum.

                "text": "The hyposphene-hypantrum articulation of the trunk vertebrae of P. langstoni presents an important opportunity to examine within-vertebral column variation because these vertebrae are preserved in three dimensions so that articulation surfaces and hyposphenehypantrum are visible and easy to discern. Moving posteriorly along the vertebral column, the hyposphene-hypantrum articulation is present in the anteriormost trunk vertebrae of the individuals represented by presacral 11 in individual \"A\" (TMM 31025-1261.4) and presacral 12 of individual \"B\" (TMM 31025-257). The articulation is also present in presacral 12 in individual \"A\" (TMM 31025-1261.2). All three of the preserved hyposphenes are triangular in posterior view, and the ventralmost edges of the triangular hyposphenes are oriented horizontally with their apices pointed dorsally along the midline. The ventrolateral corners of the triangular hyposphenes curve slightly ventrally around the neural canal. The hyposphenes (TMM 31025-1261.1, TMM 31025-1261.2, TMM 31025-257) appear to be more dorsoventrally compressed (i.e., smaller height to width ratio) in individual \"B\" than in individual \"A.\" This material described herein includes the twelfth presacral from both individuals (TMM 31025-1261.1, TMM 31025-257), so it is likely that this variation is not based on location in the vertebral column. The hypantra (TMM 31025-1261.4, TMM 31025-1261.2, TMM 31025-257) reflect a complementary shape of the hyposphene structures on their respective vertebrae. The horizontal distance between the prezygapophyses is narrower across the structure at the dorsal most edge than at the ventralmost extent, creating a triangular space for articulation. In summary, the hyposphene-hypantrum articulation appears triangular in all vertebrae described herein and therefore does not vary in general shape along the vertebral column of one individual of P. langstoni, but the two recognized individuals of P. langstoni have hyposphene structures that are markedly different in terms of height to width ratio (Table 1) .",

                "text": "The hyposphene-hypantrum articulation appears in many clades within Archosauria and has been defined simply as a vertical wall of bone ventral to the postzygapophyses and a notch between the prezygapophyses (Rauhut, 2003; Apesteguia, 2005; Hibbard & Williston, 1971) . Those previous studies included definitions of the hyposphene-hypantrum articulation that were based on the vertebral morphology of saurischian dinosaurs, but they are not comprehensive in incorporating the variation in shape in dinosaurs and pseudosuchians. Furthermore, a number of pseudosuchians also have been reported to bear the hyposphenehypantrum articulation without an explanation of why it is homologous with those structures in saurischian dinosaurs (Bonaparte, 1981; Weinbaum & Hungerb\u00fchler, 2007;  Peyer Gower & Schoch, 2009; Lautenschlager & Desojo, 2011; Weinbaum, 2013) . This is important to clarify because the hyposphene-hypantrum has been cited as a synapomorphy of Saurischia (Gauthier, 1986) and of at least one clade of pseudosuchians (Ticinosuchus + Paracrocodylomorpha, Nesbitt, 2011). Here we apply an explicit definition of this articulation to facilitate identification and future studies of intervertebral articulation in archosaurs. We define the hyposphene-hypantrum articulation as a bony projection, the hyposphene, on the posterior portion of the vertebra that fits into a complementary space, the hypantrum, on the anterior portion of the subsequent vertebra within a vertebral series (Fig. 6) . Specifically, the hyposphene is located ventral to the articular surfaces of the postzygapophyses and is connected to these articular surfaces where they converge. It is located dorsal to the neural canal and in posterior view is symmetrical or nearly symmetrical across the midline. There is a distinct angle change (typically between \u223c45 and 90 ) between the articular surfaces of the postzygapophyses and the lateral surfaces of the hyposphene. The hyposphene projection must be a comparable shape and size to that of the hypantrum space of the subsequent vertebrae because these structures articulate precisely. The shapes in lateral view of the hyposphenes may appear as circular, square, dorsoventrally elongate rectangular, triangular, diamond, and quadrilateral, and the most common shapes found in pseudosuchian archosaurs are triangles and dorsoventrally elongate rectangles (Fig. 7) . Though these shapes can vary between taxa, they also can vary within an individual. P. langstoni does not show drastic variation in hyposphene shape, but the proportions do vary along the column and between our two individuals (i.e., ratio of height to width increasing posteriorly in individual \"B\" and greater ratio of height to width in individual \"A\" than in individual \"B\") ( Table 1) . As long as these projections extend posteriorly from the neural arch, their lateral surfaces are confluent with the articular surfaces of the postzygapophyses, and there is a distinct angle change between the articular surfaces of the postzygapophyses and the projection, any of these aforementioned shapes may be considered hyposphenes. Additionally, it is important to note that these structures are currently only known from trunk vertebrae posterior to the first nine presacral vertebrae.",

There is not a clearly defined space between the prezygapophyses in this vertebra to satisfy our definition of a hypantrum. There is a slight gap between the medial aspects of the prezygapophyses, the articular surfaces of which are oriented horizontally, however these articular surfaces do not extend ventrally to form a hypantrum in accordance with our definition. No posterior surface of any vertebra of AMNH FR 30587 is clearly visible and intact, so we cannot conclusively state whether a hyposphene was present in the trunk vertebrae of known material of E. okeeffeae. Additionally, because we do not see a hypantrum present in this specimen of E. okeeffeae, we conclude that this taxon probably did not possess the hyposphene-hypantrum. Furthermore, there are no specimens of Shuvosaurus inexpectatus (e.g., TTU P-9001), the current sister taxon of E. okeeffeae (Nesbitt & Norell, 2006; Nesbitt, 2007 Nesbitt, , 2011 , that preserve a neural arch where we could evaluate whether the hyposphene-hypantrum articulation was present or absent. The other known shuvosaurid, S. longicervix (PVSJ 85), is poorly preserved (Alcober & Parrish, 1997) , and therefore it is difficult to determine definitively whether a hyposphene-hypantrum was present in that taxon as well. The sail-backed poposauroid Lotosaurus adentus (IVPP V 4880, IVPP V 48013) has not been reported to have the hyposphene-hypantrum articulation.",

The hyposphene structure of the trunk vertebra of A. babbitti (MSM 4590) is rectangular with the long axis oriented dorsoventrally in posterior view and located ventral to the postzygapophyses and dorsal to the neural canal (Nesbitt, 2005, Fig. 19 ). It does not have the triangular shape as in the trunk vertebrae of P. langstoni. The sister taxon of A. babbitti is the earliest diverging poposauroid, Xilousuchus sapingensis (IVPP V6026), and it has been cited as having the hyposphene-hypantrum as well (Nesbitt, Liu & Li, 2010) . The ninth presacral vertebra figured by Nesbitt, Liu & Li (2010 Fig. 8 ) has a clearly defined hyposphene, and it is square in posterior view. A hypantrum between the prezygapophyses is clearly seen in anterior view and is of comparable size and shape to the hyposphene of the same vertebra (Nesbitt, Liu & Li, 2010, Fig. 8 ). The identification of this vertebra as the ninth presacral (Nesbitt, Liu & Li, 2010 ) may be incorrect given that there are no other taxa with a hyposphene in the first nine presacrals. Alternatively, the presence of a hyposphene in this position may be autapomorphic for this taxon.",

Stagonosuchus nyassicus (GPIT/RE/3831, von Huene, 1938; Gebauer, 2004; Lautenschlager & Desojo, 2011 ) is reported to have the hyposphene-hypantrum in the trunk vertebrae. The anterior trunk vertebra of S. nyassicus (GPIT/RE/3831-9, von Huene, 1938; Gebauer, 2004; Lautenschlager & Desojo, 2011 , Fig. 7 ) has a clearly defined hyposphene that is rectangular, but it is only slightly elongated dorsoventrally. The posterior trunk vertebra of S. nyassicus (GPIT/RE/3831-14, von Huene, 1938; Gebauer, 2004; Lautenschlager & Desojo, 2011 , Fig. 7 ) has a hyposphene that is narrower mediolaterally and more elongated dorsoventrally than the hyposphene of its anterior trunk vertebra. This shape is distinctly different from the triangular hyposphenes of P. langstoni (Fig. 3) . In anterior view, there is a clear space between the prezygapophyses to form a hypantrum in S. nyassicus. T. ferox is a close relative to S. nyassicus (Lautenschlager & Desojo, 2011) , but the presence of the hyposphenehypantrum articulation in that taxon is ambiguous because the known material (PIZ T 2817) is preserved in a flattened slab, and the vertebral column is mostly articulated so that the anterior and posterior aspects of the vertebrae cannot clearly be seen.",

The figured anterior trunk vertebra and posterior trunk vertebra of TTU P-9002 have clearly defined hyposphene structures that appear triangular in posterior view, with the ventralmost aspect as a horizontal surface and the dorsalmost aspect as a midline apex (TTU P-9002, Weinbaum, 2013, Figs. 4 and 5) . The ventrolateral corners of the triangular hyposphene also slightly curve around the neural canal at its dorsal margin. This shape is nearly identical to those hyposphenes of P. langstoni in the anterior trunk vertebrae TMM-31025-1261.1 and TMM-31025-1261.2. The hypantrum of the anterior portion of the neural arch of the anterior (Weinbaum, 2013, Fig. 4 ) and posterior (Weinbaum, 2013, Fig. 5 ) trunk vertebrae of P. kirkpatricki (TTU P-9002) also appear triangular in anterior view with a shape and size complementary to the hyposphene of the same vertebra. The hyposphene structure of the mid-trunk vertebra of P. kirkpatricki (TTU P-9002, Weinbaum, 2013, Fig. 4 ) appears rectangular in posterior view with the long axis oriented dorsoventrally. The one known trunk vertebra of P. alisonae (UNC 15575) has clear hyposphene and hypantrum structures (Fig. 7A) . The hyposphene appears triangular in posterior view, similar to those of the anterior and posterior trunk vertebrae of P. kirkpatricki (TTU P-9002), with the midline apex directed dorsally and the ventrolateral corners curved slightly around the dorsal edge of the neural arch (Peyer et al., 2008, Fig. 4 ). The hypantrum of P. alisonae is of complementary shape and size to the hyposphene.",

Evidence for a hypantrum was cited as a small gap between the anterior portion of the prezygapophyses, and the hyposphene was cited as a thin, ventrally directed lamina of bone between the postzygapophyses. However, this proposed hyposphene was not clearly defined, and appears simply as the postzygapophyses converging at the midline, without an extension of a bony process ventral to them (NMT RB48, Nesbitt et al., 2014, Fig. 4 ). There is a slight gap between the medial aspects of the prezygapophyses; however, articular surfaces do not extend ventrally from the prezygapophyses to form a hypantrum in accordance with our refined definition. This morphology in N. songeaensis is similar to that in E. okeeffeae, which we have concluded does not have the hyposphene-hypantrum articulation.",

However, a hyposphene structure is difficult to infer on most of the vertebrae of A. brasiliensis (CPE 2186 , Desojo, Ezcurra & Kischlat, 2012 (Fig. 7F ) because much of the holotype is articulated or broken on the neural arch. Desojo, Ezcurra & Kischlat (2012) described A. brasiliensis as having hyposphenes that are \"Y-shaped\" where the elongated hyposphene structure forms the \"trunk\" of the \"Y\" and the postzygapophyses connected and dorsal to it form the top two dorsolaterally projecting \"branches\" of the \"Y\" in posterior view. On our close inspection of the well-preserved and non-articulated vertebrae of A. brasiliensis, there does not appear to be a distinct angle change between the articular surfaces of the postzygapophyses to the bony projection ventral to and between them (Fig. 7F ). Therefore we conclude that A. brasiliensis does not have a hyposphene-hypantrum according to our definition. Parker (2016b) did not consider the aetosaur S. deltatylus to have a true hyposphene-hypantrum, however the \"ventral bar\" structure on the posterior aspect of its vertebrae (Parker, 2016b, Fig. 12 ) does fit our definition of a true hyposphene. S. deltatylus has two different shape varieties of hyposphene structures present in its trunk vertebrae: one that is circular in posterior view and tapers to a point distally from the body of the vertebra (PEFO 34045 FF-22, Parker, 2016b, Fig. 13 ) ( Fig. 7E ) and a second that is triangular with a dorsally oriented point extending along the dorsoventral margin of the neural arch (PEFO 34045 FF-51, Parker, 2016b, Fig. 12 ). S. deltatylus also preserves hypantrum structures of complementary size and shapes on the anterior aspects of its neural arches. Scutarx robertsoni (Walker, 1961 , Fig. 7 ) has a \"ventral bar\" shaped hyposphene in an anterior dorsal vertebra (R 4799) that appears very similar to that of S. deltatylus. S. robertsoni also preserves complementary hypantrum structures on the anterior aspects of the anterior dorsal (R 4799) and posterior cervical (E.M. 30R) vertebrae (Walker, 1961 , Fig. 7) .",

The trunk vertebra of L. meadei, TMM 31100-448 appears to have a hyposphene that is square in posterior view; however, the postzygapophyses and surrounding portions of the neural arch are broken and compressed, making it difficult to definitively discern a hyposphene structure according to our definition (Fig. 7G) . Neither Typothorax coccinarium (NMMNH P-12964, Heckert et al., 2010, Fig. 4A) nor Paratypothorax andressorum (PEFO 3004, Lucas, Heckert & Rinehart, 2006; Hunt & Lucas, 1992 , Fig. 4 ) was reported to have the hyposphenehypantrum, and we concur with this through our observations of the published figures of those materials and through direct observation. The small aetosaur Coahomasuchus kahleorum (TMM 31100-437, Parker, 2016a) does not appear to have the hyposphenehypantrum in its trunk vertebrae; however, the known vertebral material is mostly articulated, poorly preserved, and portions of the neural arches are broken or obscured (TMM 31100-437).

Most early members of Crocodylomorpha are markedly smaller (i.e., shorter femoral lengths) (Turner & Nesbitt, 2013) than their paracrocodylomorph relatives ( Fig. 9) , such as the poposaurids (e.g., P. langstoni; P. gracilis, Weinbaum & Hungerb\u00fchler, 2007 , TTU P-10419), the rauisuchid P. kirkpatricki (TTU-P 9002, Weinbaum, 2013), other pseudosuchians (i.e., P. chiniquensis, UFRGS-PV-0156-T, Azevedo, 1991; F. tenax, PVL 3850, Bonaparte, 1981 ; S. nyassicus, GPIT/RE/3831, Lautenschlager & Desojo, 2011; Mandasuchus tanyauchen, NHMUK PV R6792, Butler et al., in press) , and the largestknown aetosaur D. spurensis (MNA V9300, Parker, 2008) . Because the hyposphenehypantrum articulation is in many large-bodied taxa but not in smaller ones (Fig. 9 ), we explored this potential correlation with body size by assigning each taxon we examined Figure 9 Plot showing femoral length versus hyposphene-hypantrum presence or absence (Table 2) with pseudosuchian archosaurs as data points (n = 24). Hyposphene-hypantrum present = blue; hyposphene-hypantrum absent = orange. Each data point corresponds to a taxon included in Table 2 . See Table 2 caption for explanation about color and placement of the two phytosaur data points.Full-size \ue90d DOI: 10.7717/peerj.4235/ fig-9 hyposphene-hypantrum articulation: taxa with femora length >300 mm typically have this extra articulation ( Fig. 9 ). While our data support this correlation, the relationship is solely visual at present and deserves rigorous statistical testing, which will be done in future studies. An exception to this body size relationship is phytosaurs, which are either the earliest diverging pseudosuchians (Gauthier, 1986; Benton & Clark, 1988; Sereno, 1991; Benton, 1999; Ezcurra, 2016) or the sister group of Archosauria (Nesbitt, 2011) . All taxa in this clade that we observed lack the hyposphene-hypantrum articulation but some have femoral lengths greater than many pseudosuchians that possess the articulation (e.g., Smilosuchus gregorii, 545 mm; Machaeroprosopus pristinus, 444 mm) (Fig. 9) . The absence of the hyposphenehypantrum in phytosaurs may be related to their inferred semi-aquatic ecology (Parrish & Padian, 1986) , which is divergent from the terrestrial ecology of other early pseudosuchians. This could mean that femoral length cannot explain the presence or absence of the hyposphene-hypantrum in aquatic forms, and this may also explain the absence of the structure in the transition to a more aquatic ecology within Crocodylomorpha.In summary, our observations of pseudosuchian archosaurs both with and without the hyposphene-hypantrum articulation showed a clear relationship between larger body sizes and the presence of the hyposphene-hypantrum articulation in trunk vertebrae across pseudosuchian archosaurs. Because of this close fit, this feature may be controlled by increases or decreases in body size and not strictly by inheritance. If so, the presence or absence of hyposphene-hypantrum would have limited use as a character in phylogenetic analyses of archosaurs (Gauthier, 1986; Nesbitt, 2011) and the character should be applied with caution when used to assign isolated vertebrae to pseudosuchian clades.
