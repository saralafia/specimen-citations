During the analytical process several previously unrecognized tool types were defined. This writer feels that the function of specific tool classes can be identified by the inspection of wear and striation patterns on artifacts. From these use-wear indicators we can determine the manner in which the tools were employed, and from these deduce what the function of the tool was.",

A proposed use for this category is difficult to formulate for two reasons: (1) the sample is too small, and (2) the key indicators of use are not present. The only thing that can safely be said is that the activity in which they were used placed great stress on the occlusal end of the tooth.

Cuthbert, of Marco, we obtained a collection of objects ploughed up during cultivation,-among which were many rather crude 'sinkers' of shell and others somewhat resembling them but too carefully made to have served for other than ornamental purposes.\" These are illustrated (ibid: fig. 8 ) and resemble the expanded center examples from Ft. Center. Others, the globular form and a long teardrop form are not found at Ft. Center. The other Ft. Center forms are given in Fig. 10 (ibid: 372) . Willey (1949b: Plates 6 and 12) illustrates examples from Belle Glade. Interestingly enough, his sample is more varied, design-wise, than Ft. Center.

Again, this is probably indicative of its having been used as an abrading stone.PondIn keeping with previous finds, the recovery of lithic mater ials from the pond was limited. A few non-diagnostic chips were recovered from the midden base, as well as 118 limestone, sandstone and hematite rocks. These were all unmodified and represent cast-off materials from Md. A. A piece of partially mineralized wood, the raw material for the oblique spheroid object from Md. B, was also recovered.No special significance or ceremonial association is attached to this.PLUMMETSThe Ft, Center excavations produced a total of 16 plummets.Eight were made of'stone and 7 of conch columellas. Md. A contributed 12 of the plummets-5 stone and 7 of 8 shell. Three stone and one shell examples were recovered from the pond. Md. n did not contain anv nlummets. This can be due to' 3 factors: 1) excavation procedures, 2) preservation, and 3) there were none present.To be classified as a plummet it is felt that the artifacts in question must show modification of a certain type. Some examples are unquestionably plummets because they fit the classic teardrop shape with grooves at one or both ends. An alternate form is the expanded center plummet, again with grooves at one or both ends. These are easy to recognize in the stone specimens, but due to chemical changesome shell examples are questionable. For this reason, unless a shell specimen possessed the attributes of shape and grooving, it was not classified as a plummet. Four specimens were of the proper shape to be considered plummets but lacked any indication of end arooving. These are classified as problematical examples. A description of the individual plummets is not necessary'. The illustration (Figs. 15 and 16) is self-explanatory. Of particular interest, and importance, are the materials from which they are made. Uithout exception, the raw materials are alien to the Lake Okeechobee region. The lithic materials are igneous in nature. The closest source of these materials is in the Piedmont. The lithic materials are nranlte, crystalline quartz, granodiorite, gneiss, diorite, rhyolite-gran.ite and a single broken worked quartz crystal. (S. O'R Sears identification). Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission.The shell materials are 13usycon, Strombus, or Fasciolaria conch columellas which are probably from the southwest coast of Florida. VJhile conch do occur alone the Atlantic coast, it is felt that there are too few to account for the number which are known to have been traded durinq this and later time periods (w. H. Sears, personal communication). The five tear-drop shaped stone plummets exhibit flattened areas on their bodies. This same desiqn factor is observable in two of the shell examples. SHELL A total of 421 shells and shell fragments were recovered from the areas in question. This count does not include the previously discussed shell adze blades and plummets. As with the other sections of this paper, the Md. A midden produced the most examples. The pond area produced only a few specimens, and Md. B an extremely limited number. These Md. B materials are of a different nature than the others due to two factors. The first is that of preservation and the second is intrusive materials. The poor preserving powers of the white sand mound reduced the Hopewellian materials to recognizable stains in the sand. The intrusive materials from the white sand cap are pre served, but in poor condition. Mound A Three categories of shell remains can be recognized from the Md, A midden.-They'are: 1) Shell artifacts; 2) whole shells; and 3) shell fragments. These, of course, can be subdivided into variants or parts of the shell. VJhere applicable this was done. The shell artifacts, other than the adze or celt blades, v;ere made of Busycon perversum, Fasciolaria gigantea, and possibly Strombus gigas and Marainella. To be classified as an artifact, the shell or fraqment in question must demonstrate intentional shaping or modifica tion through use. In the case of the conch shells we have grinding, notching, pecked holes, and the removal of the columella as modifica tions.Fig. 18 illustrates the range of hafted conch shell tools. These can be divided into three, possibly four types. Two of our types are represented by multiple examples from Ft. Center and otherGlades area sites. We have two single examples of types; one(Fig. 22)made from a Fasciolaria gigantea shell is found on other, coeval, sites in the Glades area(Goggin 1949 and MS)  (Moore 1901). The other(Fig. 23)is a problematical type because of its poor condition. Due to the possibly unique treatment of the anterior canal and beak it has been separated from the others.In \"The Archaeology of the Glades Area, Southern Florida,\" an unpublished manuscript, and \"Cultural Occupation at Goodland Point, Florida\" (MS; 1949) Goggin goes to great pains to define and place chronologically and spatially a series of hafted conch shell tools.",

It was hoped that in the end a series of tool types would be defined from the various categories. Unfortunately, this was only partially possible. Only through interpretation of wear patterns, it is felt, can the archaeologist legitimately assign names such as point, leister point, or awl to these categories. By what sometimes seems to be indiscriminate use of names, or following conventionally used names for categories of artifacts, the archaeologist is often misleading and inadvertently deceiving his readers and students.Category I (Bone)(Fig. 26)    This group of artifacts, consists of those which have, in crosssection, a round distal end. The whole tool can be divided into three sections-distal and proximal ends and the area between them referred to here as the transition.Of the 36 examples represented in this category, 10 of them are complete, 17 are broken distal ends, and the remaining 9 represent \"body\" sections with broken distal and proximal ends. The absence of proximal ends is explained in the discussion of Category II.The complete examples were very enlightening in some respects and disappointing in others. The only indication of wear was the varying amount of sheen exhibited on the distal ends. No striation patterns were discerned on any of the distal ends. A careful examina tion of the point of the distal ends revealed an important fact. VJith the exception of the broken points, the sharp tips were uneven and irregular in nature. The lack of regularity in the tips is attributed to manufacture and not use. It was in a form which cannot be attrib uted to wear. The tips would be ever so slightly larger than the shaft leading up to them, not worn down as they would be from use.The more bone is handled, abraded, or used, the more of a sheen or luster it acquires, the foremost example of this being arth ritic ebumation where the bones of the joint take on a highly polished ivory look. The ten complete examples show what could be termed a continuum of use. The surface conditions range from ragged to highly polished. The lower end of the scale is represented by specimens which fit into the cateqory, but do not have shiny, used surfaces.The progression is toward a uniform, darker sheen on the surface. The use process through which the implements underwent did not produce any diagnostic striation patterns.The proximal ends of tools indicated a very uniform manufacturing/haftinq technique. Unlike the distal end, this portion of the implement does not exhibit a finished appearance. It is angular in nature, still rough from manufacture and shows distinct parallel striations on the flat surfaces, possibly the cut marks from shark tooth cutting implements. The extreme proximal end of the implement was manufactured in either a point or wedge shape. In a few examples this portion was broken off. This proximal end was in 8 of the 10 complete cases darker in color than the distal. This staining may be a result of the hafting process.The area referred to as the transition is where the proximal and distal ends meet. Its nature is that of an abrupt change. It is marked by a cessation of striations and staining. In some instances a ring, either dark or light, can be discerned at this point.The broken tips demonstrated the same use continuum as the complete examples. The above mentioned observations concerning the tip characteristics holds true: none showed that they were used on highly abrasive materials. The broken body sections were like their complete counterparts in showing a continuum of sheen and demonstrating an abrupt transition from proximal to distal ends.",

This indicates that the points were contemporaneous.It is apparent that the range of point types from Ft. Center is great. We have everything from typical Archaic broad bladed stemmed points to the small triangular Pinellas points of post 1300 A.D. on a site with a good C-14 date of 200-400 A.D. A two stage conclusion follows from the analysis of the artifacts: (1) The flint industry rep resented is an extension of the existing Florida Archaic. This is demonstrated by the presence of typically Archaic points; (2) The Ft. Center chipped stone industry represents an adaptation to a widely inclusive and variant ecological situation. Different game requires different hunting techniques and instruments. This is reflected in the different forms of the projectile points. In this case, the form of the artifact is determined by its function in the society. The second part of the conclusion is apparently applicable only to the points.

A word needs to be said about the probable use-wear pattern of projectile points. It is possible that an arrow or dart point would not develop any significant indication of its function. It is questionable that a single arrow would be used a great number of times. If it penetrated the soft areas of an animal, striations would probably not develop,and if it struck bone, chances are that the tip would break. The point then would be either discarded or re-worked.",

Further reproduction prohibited without permission.deposits in the northern part of the state and in Georgia. This does not deviate from the pattern already established of the utilization of local as well as imported materials. The distribution of chipping debitage indicates that there was specialization within this craft. The lack of extreme overlap be tween Mounds A and B of the stemmed knives, debitage from Md. A and the pink and red points and chert of Md. B indicates that there was no overlap between the production of utilitarian and ceremonial points. The Hopewellian emphasis upon the exotic is demonstrated by the presence of the oblique spheroid object. Of seemingly no utilitarian value, and of a definitely imported material, it must have been con nected with the ceremonial aspects of the Hopewell Phenomenon. PLUMMETS The distribution of the plummets is our best indicator of their function. Unfortunately in this case a paradox arises from using location as an analytical basis. Since no debitage of igneous rocks or incomplete specimens were found on the site, we must take this as evidence that the stone plummets were imported as whole items. Since the Piedmont is the closest source for the materials, either an extensive trade system was involved (probable) or long trips were made by the people of Ft. Center to obtain the objects. Such an effort, it would seem, would assign a high value to these items. With three ex ceptions, this hypothesis is proven false by the location of the plummets. Twelve of them were recovered from the living floor on Md. A. It will be remembered that this mound and its associated midden were not ceremonial in nature. The three specimens associated with the human bone layer of the charnel house pond support the hypothesis. In comparison to the Md. A plummets, the pond specimens are unique. Here we have 1) an effigy specimen, 2) a plummet (broken) made from a single crystal of quartz, and 3) the largest specimen, of a lighter colored material with two accented flat areas on the body, these three being examples of unique forms of everyday materials. This, and not the source of the materials or artifacts may be the exotic quality involved. The one problematical shell plummet was recovered from the basal midden and further supports the assumption of the nature of this deposit. The function of the plummets is still an important question, which remains unanswered. In the context of Ft. Center, it can probably be safely said that they were utilitarian in nature, with the more exotic examples being reserved for inclusion with burials. The question arises as to whether there is a direct relationship between the design of the stone and shell plummets. Outwardly, a relationship appears to exist. We have the tear-drop shaped and ex panded center plummets represented in both stone and shell. Variants of the basic design theme are also represented in both mediums; for example Fig.15 shows flattened variants in both shell and stone. A similar parallel is seen in the expanded center examples. With the exception of the retention of the whorl on two examples, the forms are remarkably similar. SHELL The shell tools have been divided into four types: adze, celt/ axes, gouges, and dippers. Usually, they are made from whole Busycon perversum shells which have been modified by grinding the beak and pecking holes and notches in the whorl and lip. They are hafted by wedging a shaft through the holes or notched lip and against the columella. Further strength can be obtained by lashing through addi tional holes or removed sections of the spiral. Evidence'is present for multiple angled tools. The three-holed celts can conceivable be mounted in two manners. The first is using the notched lip and a whorl hole, the second utilizing two pecked holes. While not altering the apparent function of the tool, the angle of the working surface to the craftsman would be different. The one-holed specimens with notched lip are divided into categories of celt and adze, depending upon the orientation of the ground beak to the haft.Gouges were made from the Busycon perversum and Fasciolaria gigantea. The Busycon varities gave the craftsman a moderately wide gouge while the Fasciolaria gouge was norrow.",

They were not used in conjunction with abrasive materials, since no striation patterns are at all evident and the points are apparently intact. Their use as projectile points is rather dubious. It is hard to imagine that a single point could be used enough to acquire the sheen demonstrated by these implements and still remain intact. The same can be said for leister points or gorges. Compound fish hooks are another possibility, but size makes this rather improbable. A distinct possibility is that they were parts of compound tools used in the manufacture of textiles and basketry. The abrasion of the raw materials on the exposed bone during the manrfacturing process would account for the over-all sheen and lack of abrasion on the tip. The possibilities seem endless, and until wear studies of known bone tools are conducted, they will remain so.The other categories, with the exception of IV are covered by the opening statement. The turtle shells may represent rattles, but who can tell? The antlers could have ceremonial associations or be the cast-off remains of a deer. The bead, carved and polished bones, may have been decorative or served a ceremonial purpose. The interpreta tions are all rather tenuous due to the lack of cultural associations.Two conclusions concerning the Category I and II implements can be stated. The first concerns manufacture, the second use. Our first conclusion is that the continuum of sheen expressed in the two categories correlated with the stages of manufacture of the implements, the end point being the most highly polished specimen. The alternate conclusion is that we can see a continuum of wear expressed by the various examples.The finished product is the pointed, shaped bone* through use, it acquires a sheenj the more it is used, the more sheen.If conclusion I is correct, then the end point of manufacturing process is a highly polished, specialized tool. This high finish aspect does not minifest itself on any other artifacts from Md. A.The highly sophisticated finish is associated only with the pond materials, the wood carvings and highly polished bone pins being examples of this. This discrepancy would tend to negate the first .hypothesis.Conclusion IIfits in well with the habitation aspect of Md. A. The highly finished materials are associated with the ceremonial areas of the site, specifically, the pond. The cause of the wear comes to question. The lack of striation patterns or any indication of abrasion would rule out their use with hard or gritty materials. The over-all sheen on the surface would indicate that the whole distal end was subjected to the same amount of friction. A possible use would be in weaving or basket making tools. The materials employed in this textile industry would not be sufficiently hard to leave striations or wear away parts of the bone. The movement of the tool through the fibers of the basket or cloth would account for the over-all abrasion needed to produce the sheen.

They offer the archaeologist a chance to study part of the human adaptive mechanism in a little known, for North America, environmental situation.The artifactual inventory is varied and quite extensive. Both local and imported materials were used, with a heavy reliance being placed on conch shell. The lip of the Strombus gigas was used to man ufacture the shell/celt adzes while Busycon perversum and Fasciolaria gigantea shells served as gouges, celts, adzes and picks. The columella from these shells were employed as plummets similar in design to the ones made from igneous rock whose nearest source is the Piedmont.

The craftsman could choose from his shell tools adzes with various width bits, gouges with a eontinous range of working edges, celts, and possibly picks.The extensive amounts of broken conch shell indicates that they were available in large quantities. By reason of the great variety of tools and other objects made from their shell, the conch must have been of great importance to the community. The other shell remains show a reliance upon both marine and fresh water shellfish. The two problematical shell beads show that there was some concern with decoration of the body or dress.BONE, ANTLER, AND TURTLE SHELLThe section contained four important categories. The first two are the category I and II bone needles. Interpreted as parts of compound weaving needles, they form a major part of the artifactual remains. We may conclude that the weaving industry was of major importance. By weaving, we mean textiles, basketry and netting. The third important category is that composed of the elaborately carved and polished bone pins. These were obviously included in burials and can be interpreted as elaborate hair pins.The fourth category is of a different nature. It is the one comprised of deer antlers, primarily those recovered from the Charnel House Pond. As previously mentioned, these may well have been parts of an antler headdress. METAL The only metal recovered during the excavations was a small galena \"hemi-cone\". Its occurrence on Md. A living surface is a problem, as it would seem to be of ceremonial significance. Any function, utilitarian or otherwise, cannot be determined. It is apparently an object of ceremonial (because of its exotic nature) significance which became lost on the mound.

For this reason some of the analytical categories are subjected to a comparative process in the attempt to show that the Ft. Center non-ceramic artifacts are: (1) not unique in nature; (2) represent part of a continuum of development which can be recognized as existing in the Archaic; and (3) some classic Hopewellian designs can be detected in the limited ceremonial finds.The comparative materials consist almost exclusively of published site reports and their illustrations. While we recognize that minute differences may not be observable in the photograph or be able to be extracted from the text due to differential analytical and descriptive methods, it is felt that this is a legitimate method. The primary assumption this writer is working under is that over-all form is the important analytical factor. The shape of the tool is the cultural link or adaptive mechanism to the environment. If the researcher establishes his own base line through use-wear analysis this is an effective and useful method. However, it does have shortcomings. As stated above, unnoticeable minute differences may be significant.Another is that different cultures, or even segments of the same culture may utilize the same tool \"type\" in different manners. If the use-wear indicators are not listed in the text, or clearly illustrated, this may be a great problem. Short of traveling great distances and spending immense amounts of time and money in the re-anaiysis of existing collections, we really have no other method of comparing materials.",

This may be tested by excavations at Big Mound City and Tony's Mound to see if the difference holds true.Goggin and Sommer (1949:  Plate 8e) depict a stone globular example from Upper Matecumbe Key. Willey (1949a: Plate 15 A, B, J) illustrates stone and shell plummets from the previously mentioned Perico Island period. For the later Safetv]Harbor period (ibid: Plate 59C) he shows a stone example. Wauchope (1966: Fig. 252) illustrates several crude examples which are of undeterminable age. He also illustrates a comparative selection of plummets from the Eastern United States ranging from Archaic to Mature Mississippi (ibid: 197). Benson (1967: 128) illustrates polished stone plummets from a historic site in Polk County, Florida. Bullen, Partridge and Harris (1970: 117-118) write: \"The most common non-ceramic artifact at the Safford Mound were plummets, all seemingly well made. The continued occurrence of these objects in burial mounds, and their virtual absence in middens, surely indicates their use as personal adornments and not as new weights for fishing. While most prominent during the Weeden Island period, they are also found with both Deptford and Safety Harbor interments.\" These materials illustrate the long span of plummet use and variety of materials used, as a copper example of the expanded center variety is illustrated (ibid: 116). The contention is held suspect that their use was for adornment. Perhaps only the finest examples were included in the graves, as with the Ft. Center examples. Plummets are reported from the Little Woods Midden, Big Oak Island, Tchefuncte Midden {Ford and Quimby 1345: 13-17), Crooks Site",

The grooving and striations are the only apparent modifications to the stones. Again, they are apparently sharpening stones. This category appears to have been stationary while the implement was stroked along its surface.A total of 35 specimens exhibited smoothed or ground surfaces.In each case, this seems to be the only modification of the stone. The examples range from large (200 x 200mm) complete slabs, to small, highly worn examples which exhibit only small patches of recognizable ground surfaces.Fig. 14illustrates a selection of these grinding stones. Although no striation patterns were detected, it is felt that these stones were used in manufacturing shell and bone tools. Their coarse surfaces would be adequate for the grinding involved in the shaping of bits on conch tools. Of particular interest in this col lection is the largest coarse sandy limestone slab. It was found in association with the lime deposits which W. H. Sears (personal communi cation) feels were used in the preparation of maize. While it is recognized that physical association within a midden does not necessar ily mean that the artifacts or features are functionally correlated, this association may be meaningful. This grinding stone is concave in nature and may very well have been used for grinding of maize or other vegetable products. Although the hypothesized lime treatment of the maize precludes the use of grinding instruments, it is possible that the slab was used for the preparation of nuts and seeds. The use of wooden mortars (hypothesized) and pestles (two recovered from the site) for this activity is more probable.Chert-Quartzite. The overwhelming majority of materials from Md. A consists of chert nodules and chips. Of the 270 specimens recovered, 189 were unworked percussion and pressure chips, and 81 were nodules. The debitage was mostly the gray, gray/white and brown chert, which the majority of the Md. A points were made from. The nodules were water rolled and still covered with limestone. One cache of 52 nodules and 15 percussion chips was recovered. Of these, 31 of the nodules were broken or chipped in such a way as to expose the chert on the interior. This may indicate that the craft specialists who made the points were concerned with the color of the material. The scarcity of brightly colored materials lends support to this hypoth esis. Only 11 chips and 1 nodule of materials differing from the usual range were recovered. These included one fragment of quartz and a piece of quartzite. The cache of unworked chert nodules indicates that this area was the center of the flint chipping activities for Md. A. Unfor tunately, no concentrations of chips or partially completed points were recovered to support this hypothesis. The absence of raw materials similar to those found on Md. B and in the pond presents three alterna tives: 1) These points were made on Md. A but in a different and unexcavated place; 2) the points were brought to the area complete, and 3) they were manufactured on Md. B. This last alternative is supported by materials recovered from Md. B, which is discussed in a later section.Twelve examples were placed in a special category due either to their unique form or material. Five are of partially mineralized vrood, the same material from which a unique Md. B artifact is made.One is a broken quartzite pebble, two are curious, polished (by water?) unstriated pebbles, and one is a small rectangular limestone piece. The remaining two are the most interesting; One is made of sandstone, is pointed and irregularly shaped. Mo use-wear marks are evident, so it may be natural or man-made. The second is made from a coarse gray 'sandstone. It seems to be only partially finished with three-quarters of it only roughly shaped. The remaining quarter is in the shape of a blunted cone. As no use-wear marks were detected on its surface its function is only conjectural.A deliberately made brown chert object was also recovered.It shows intentional secondary pressure chipping along the edges and some step-like use-wear chips. A projected use for this object would be that of a scraper usually referred to as a thumbnail scraper.As is expected from the nature of the mound, few materials were recovered. A total of 32 unworked chips, one broken chert nodule, a shaped, flat-sided oblique spheroid(Fig. 20)made from partially mineralized wood, one smoothed sandstone piece and two pieces of limonite with hematite were recovered. The chips for the most part consist of materials not found on Md. A. Included are pink, red and white chert chips and a pink chert Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission.blade-like object which has been struck from a core. No re-working or use-wear markings were noticeable.The implication of the uniqueness of the chert materials is that Md. B produced most if not all of its own points. This wastage correlates nicely with the point specialization mentioned previously for the mound. The points from Md. B can therefore be viewed as having special significance.The unique oblique spheroid is a puzzling phenomenon. Its location definitely associates it with the practitioner who lived on the mound. We must therefore consider it ceremonial in nature. Its exact purpose is not determinable at this time. Of interest is that smaller pieces of the same material were recovered from both Md. A and the pond.",

This stems from the lack of use-wear analysis of the materials and illustration of the range of finds. We can, from materials recovered from Belle Glade (Willey 1949b: plates 7, 0, Q, R, 15c) show that the wear and hafting patterns existed on similar specimens on a different site. This in itself is significant in that the two sites in question, Ft. Center and Belle Glade, are contemporary and represent related ceremonial structures. From this we can hypothesize that: (1) similar wear patterns will appear on specimens at Big Mound City-PB48 (Willey 1949b: 73-77) and Tony's Mound-Hrl3, two other related ceremonial centers (W,H. Sears, personal communication); and (2) similar wear patterns will occur on specimens recovered from the outlying supporting farmsteads-if they are present. Preliminary analysis of materials recovered from the Boca Weir site (PB 56) reveals identical wear patterns on teeth which fit the Type 1 tools. Karklins (1968: 67-73) illustrates a battered example of our Category VII teeth. The similarity of point designs over large geographical areas has long been a recognized phenomenon. Newell and Krieger (1949: 164) wrote of a specific type: \"Gary Stemmed. This is the writer's name for what appears to be a tremendously widespread type in virtually the entire woodlands of the eastern United States. It includes many variations in size, workmanship, and stem and blade form, but in general is a heavy point with the stem contracting to a sharp or rounded type.\" Points of this general type are found in Florida (Bullen 1968: 29; Willey 1949a: Plate 42), Georgia (Wauchope 1966: 92-163), Alabama (Webb &amp; DeJarnette 1942: Plate 227), the Carolina Piedmont (Coe 1964: 44), Safatv Harbor complexes, I think it clear that these points are part of the Safety Harbor cultural complex.\" For this design, we can then establish a life span of from 5 to 7,000 years. Of particular interest are the small triangular points which are generally thought to be Late Woodland innovations. The Ft. Center materials, Hamilton inpurvate triangular points (Lewis and Kneeberg 1946: Plate 65), examples from Middle Woodland sites in New York (Ritchie 1965: Plates 81 and 88) indicate an earlier date for this New York (Since there are no sherds in our collection attributable to pre-form.Small triangular points were recovered from a Deptford deposit</td></tr><tr><td>Shell artifacts include: celts made of Strombus gigas lips,</td></tr><tr><td>picks, hammers, adzes, chisels, hones, conch shell cups, plummets of</td></tr><tr><td>various designs, beads and miscellaneous ornaments and broken materials.</td></tr><tr><td>Stone artifacts include: projectile points of various forms,</td></tr><tr><td>weights or sinkers, a celt, abrading and smoothing tools, pipe frag</td></tr><tr><td>ments, tubes, plummets, and grooved, bars.</td></tr></table>",

                "text": "It was recovered from a Safety Harbor Period midden, suggesting two possibilities. One is that it was a tool. This is deduced from its battered condition and. its location in a midden deposit. The other is that there is a long continuum of use of teeth of this type, as they are also found in the Ft. Center midden.POINTS Three ideas will be considered here. The first is the wide spread occurence of similar point designs. The second is the occurence of various point designs over large time spans. The third is that small triangular points are not a Mississippian innovation. Ritchie 1961: 14) and undoubtedly many other places. The pertinent point is that this same design is found in the midden deposit of Md. A at Ft. Center. Other point designs are equally widely distributed. This point needs no further documentation. Each of the point designs can be shown to exist in areas outside of peninsular Florida. The second idea, that of point designs having long chronological existence is easily substantiated. Gary-like stemmed points are found in the Hiwassee Island and Dallas components at Hiwassee Island,Tenn., as well as in the earlier Hamilton component.(Lewis and Kneeberg   1946: Plates 65 and 66). When dealing with materials recovered from stratified mounds one must recognize that old materials may be included in the fill. This makes the analysis and interpretation of these materials difficult and in many cases questionable. These typical Archaic points have been found in Safety Harbor period sites.Sears (1958: 5)  writes: \"It may be noted that they (the points) are all of the larger, stemmed or side-notched varieties usually associated with earlier horizons.",
