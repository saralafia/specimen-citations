Sabal Adanson ex Guersent, with 15 extant species, is now confined to Mexico, the Caribbean Islands, Bermuda, and the southeastern United States (Zona 1990 ), but fossil records indicate that the genus was more widespread in the Northern Hemisphere, occurring in midlatitudes of North America and Europe and possibly also in Asia during the Tertiary (reviewed in Manchester 1999; Dransfield et al. 2008) . Although Sabal was previously recognized based on seeds as old as Early Eocene (;52 Ma), the Aguja occurrence extends the minimum age of this genus back to the Campanian (;77 Ma). The significance of fossil Sabal from the Aguja Formation is considered in relation to the phytogeography of this genus and the ecological co-occurrence with herbivorous dinosaurs.",

Both the lower shale member and the lowermost part of the upper shale member consist primarily of dark organic-rich shale, lignite, and coal that accumulated in poorly drained brackish-water marshes or swamps close to the shoreline. These deposits interfinger with coastal strand plain and marine shelf deposits of the Pen Formation. The upper part of the upper shale member consists of drab fluvial floodplain deposits, primarily olive, yellow, and gray mudstone interbedded with lenticular stream channel sandstone. These sediments accumulated in better-drained freshwater alluvial environments some distance landward of the shoreline. Most of the diverse fossil wood assemblage thus far documented for the Aguja Formation has been recovered from the upper shale member, including a unique association of in situ tree stumps (Agujoxylon olacaceoides and Metcalfeoxylon kirtlandense) that demonstrates that dicot trees were dominant canopy-forming elements in some Late Cretaceous forests at lower latitudes of western North America (Lehman and Wheeler 2001) .",

These are all features that Mai (1976) indicated as characteristic of the genus. Descriptions of the position of the embryo scar have varied in the literature as a result of conflicting interpretations of ''which way is up.'' Paleobotanists have referred to the position of this scar as equatorial to subequatorial, treating the prominent hilar cavity as the apical end of the seed, whereas neobotanists refer to the position as equatorial to supraequatorial or subapical, treating the hilar scar as basal (Zona 1990; Dransfield et al. 2008) . Despite apparent differences from the descriptions, when orientations are treated consistently, the position of the embryo corresponds in the fossil and extant Sabal seeds. Here we treat the hilum as basal and the embryo position as equatorial to supraequatorial.",

These two groups are sister to all remaining Coryphoideae, which is now considered to be a morphologically diverse group including not only Corypha but also, for example, Phoenix, Rhapis, Rhapidophyllum, Trachycarpus, Chamaerops, Brahea, Serenoa, Colpothrinax, Pritchardia, Washingtonia, Livistona, Copernicia, Bismarckia, Satranala, Hyphaene, Medemia, Borassodendron, Borassus, Lodoicea, Latania, Corypha, and Caryota. The seed morphology of Sabal appears to be unique among these and other clades of the palm family. Seeds of the sister subtribe, Thrinaceae, are globose to slightly prolate, without the prominent basal depression, and in some genera are prominently grooved (Dransfield et al. 2008) . Among the other Coryphoidieae, seeds of Washingtonia are similarly smooth and shiny with a prominent concavity, but the concavity is lateral rather than basal, and the seed is ellipsoidal rather than oblate. Given the apparent uniqueness of Sabal seeds and the phylogenetic separation of this genus from other Coryphoid palms, it seems reasonable to place these Cretaceous seeds in the extant genus.",

This species is based on stem fragments with attached petioles, which showed features of systematic value, allowing assignment of this Eocene palm to subfamily Coryphoideae, tribe Corypheae. The anatomy of palm stems varies considerably even within a single individual, both horizontally and vertically, and is affected by stem age (Tomlinson 1990) . This variability makes it difficult to assign isolated palm stem fragments to individual genera. It has long been recognized that assigning fossil palm stems to extant genera or groups of genera is difficult because systematically diagnostic characters have not been found for many groups. Kaul (1960) , who reviewed earlier work on palm anatomy, remarked that there were no workable natural or artificial classifications for fossil palm stem anatomy. Nambudiri and Tidwell (1998) reviewed the characteristics used in classifying Palmoxylon species. They found that some of the features previously used to distinguish Palmoxylon species were features of dubious taxonomic value because they were affected by position within the stem.",

According to Tomlinson (1961) the sabaloid palm group has well-developed fibrous bundle sheaths, undivided phloem bundles, and xylem surrounded by parenchyma; within the group the number of metaxylem vessels per bundle is variable. The Aguja palms also have these features. These traits are not exclusive to the sabaloid palms; nevertheless, they do not contradict the evidence from seeds and foliage for the recognition of Sabal in the Aguja flora. The Olmos Formation shares some dicot genera with the Aguja and Javelina formations of Big Bend (Wheeler and Lehman 2009) , so it is possible that there also are shared monocots. Four Palmoxylon species have been reported from the Olmos Formation (Cevallos-Ferriz and Ricalde-Moreno 1995): Palmoxylon longum, Palmoxylon commune, Palmoxylon fibrosum, and Palmoxylon polymorphum. The size of fibrous bundle sheaths and some features of ground tissue parenchyma in P. commune and P. fibrosum are similar to those of the Aguja palms.",

Adaxial surface of the leaves may exhibit a 'hastula' or ligule-like appendage at the junction of petiole and blade.'' Among extant palms, leaves fitting this description occur in various other predominantly coryphoid genera, in addition to Sabal (Dransfield et al. 2008) , so the morphogenus Sabalites should not be equated with Sabal. Dorf (1939) assigned the Aguja fossils to the genus Sabalites and indicated relationships with the subfamily Sabaleae rather than direct assignment to the extant genus Sabal because he considered that other genera of the subfamily are also similar. Daghlian (1978) recognized the extant genus Sabal, as well as the morphogenera Sabalites, Costapalma Daghlian, and Palustrapalma Daghlian, from Eocene fronds with well-preserved epidermal anatomy. However, these Cretaceous Aguja leaf fossils, known only from impressions, without epidermal anatomy, should be retained in the morphogenus Sabalites. Nevertheless, we hypothesize that these leaves were produced, along with the Palmoxylon stems, by the same plants that shed the Sabal seeds described here.",

Dransfield et al. (2008) reviewed the fossil record for Sabal and Sabalites. The oldest verified occurrence of Sabalites is Sabalites carolinensis leaves from the Coniacean-Santonian of eastern North America (Berry 1914; Kva cek and Herman 2004) ; these are the oldest unequivocal fossils of Arecaceae (Harley 2006) . Other Late Cretaceous records include palm leaves referred to as Sabalites longirhachis (Unger) J. Kva cek et Herman from the Campanian of Austria (Kva cek and Herman 2004). Sabal and sabaloid fossils are also known from the Tertiary to Holocene from a variety of sites that are not only within but also well outside the current range of the genus, e.g., Great Britain (Reid and Chandler 1933) , Oregon (Manchester 1994) , Kentucky, Tennessee, Texas (Daghlian 1978) , China, and Japan (Zona 1990 ). The Asian occurrences are based only on leaves without epidermal anatomy and have not been confirmed by seeds and should be treated in the morphogenus Sabalites, but we accept the European seed records as valid representatives of the extant genus Sabal. Its range diminished after the terminal Eocene cooling, and the genus was eradicated from Europe after the Miocene.",

More recent work also suggests a Laurasian origin for coryphoid palms (Bjorholm et al. 2006) . Lehman (1985) interpreted the palm-bearing part of the Aguja upper shale member as consisting of deltaic interdistributary marsh and coastal floodplain deposits, accumulated immediately landward of the shoreline. This sedimentary facies association is compatible with the coastal environments favored by some modern Sabal species, e.g., Sabal maritima (Kunth) Burret (Wade and Langdon 1990; Zona 1990 ). The palm seeds and stems are found in association with two of the typical Aguja wood assemblages recognized by Wheeler and Lehman (2000, 2005) : the platanoid-icacinoid assemblage, which consists predominantly of small, slender axes of low-growing shrubs or scrambling vines, and the cupressoidpodocarpoid ''acme'' zone, which is dominated by ''logjam'' accumulations of large conifer trunks. The occurrence of palm stems and seeds in association with both of these wood assemblages suggests that palms may have grown in areas bordering both vegetational facies, for example, in the same way that modern Sabal palmetto (Walt.) Lodd. ex J. A. & J. H. Schulz. in Florida grows in ''hammocks'' between salt marshes and stands of cypress or pine forest (Wade and Langdon 1990) . A similar setting was envisioned by Wing et al. (1993) , who documented palmetto-dominated vegetation based on an in situ assemblage of diverse leaf remains from a delta plain environment in the early Maastrichtian or late Campanian Meeteetse Formation of Wyoming.",

                "text": "It is significant that juvenile certatopsian and hadrosaurian dinosaur skeletal material occurs in association with these Sabal seeds, at all four sites. For example, one of the Sabal bracknellense seeds was found at the WPA (UF404) quarry site, described by Lehman (2007) , that preserves a mass mortality assemblage of the ceratopsian Chasmosaurus mariscalensis Lehman. The skeletal material consists mostly of disarticulated limb and girdle elements and vertebral centra ( fig. 5 ). Apart from their small size, the isolated bones are identifiable as juvenile on the basis of their cortical bone texture and open neurocentral sutures. The skeletal elements belong to individuals of varied sizes. For example, identifiable elements recovered at TMM 42534 represent individuals from 26% to 70% adult size ( fig. 5 ). Hence, young animals of varied ages inhabited or were preserved at these sites. Juvenile dinosaurs are otherwise quite rare in the Aguja Formation. This co-occurrence led Lehman (2002) to suggest that there may have been an ecological relationship between palms and juvenile dinosaur herbivores. Some of these fossil Sabal seeds show apparent pre-or paradepositional breakage, but there are no obvious bite marks, and it is unclear whether the breakage was biologically or physically induced. Barrett and Willis (2001) and Butler et al. (2009) reviewed evidence for coevolutionary interaction between angiosperms and herbivorous dinosaurs but found little support in either the times of appearance or the diversification patterns of major plant and dinosaur clades to indicate that dinosaurs played a significant role in the adaptive radiation of flowering plants. Lecky and Tiffney's (2002) review of the North American record found that hadrosaurians tend to co-occur with floras with a high percentage of angiosperms. Whether by intensity of browsing, environmental disturbance (''dinoturbation''), or acting as seed dispersal agents, it seems certain that large dinosaurian herbivores exerted some influence on the vegetative structure and composition of Mesozoic plant communities.

However, direct evidence of the kinds of plant tissues they consumed is scant. Putative gut contents preserved within articulated skeletons of several Late Cretaceous hadrosaurs contain wood, leaf cuticle, and seeds of both gymnosperms and angiosperms, but it is possible that these tissues instead represent detritus washed into the abdominal cavities with sediment during burial (Currie et al. 1996) . More definitive gut contents preserved within an ankylosaur skeleton include vascular tissue, foliage, and seeds of angiosperms (Molnar and Clifford 2000) . Coprolites attributed to hadrosaurs on the basis of their size, form, and spatial association with skeletal remains contain fragments of gymnosperm wood, foliage, and seeds (Chin and Gill 1996; Baghai-Riding and DiBenedetto 2001; Tweet et al. 2008) . Some coprolites possibly attributable to dinosaurian herbivores contain leaf cuticle, stem fragments, and abundant small angiosperm seeds (Nambudiri and Binda 1989; Rodriguez de la Rosa et al. 1998) . Such evidence may support the notion that dinosaurs were indiscriminant browsers and only facultative seed dispersal agents (Tiffney 2004) . Zona (1990) summarized observations on the ecology of modern Sabal, and several of the attributes seem well suited for an environment inhabited by large herbivores. Sabal species have a high tolerance for disturbance and are widespread in disrupted lowland areas, thriving as an invasive ''weed'' today in anthropogenic habitats. They can withstand burning and even persist after clearing for agriculture (Zona 1990 ). The aerial stem arises only after many years of underground growth; the underground stem may be vital in allowing Sabal to withstand disturbance and to rapidly colonize open areas. The high tolerance for disturbance exhibited by Sabal may have initially evolved as an adaptation to the presumably large ecological ''footprint'' of dinosaurian herbivores, in the manner hypothesized by Bakker (1978) .",

In Late Cretaceous environments and before the appearance in Paleogene time of large fruits, nuts, and seeds adapted for biotic dispersal in tropical forest dicots, palm fruits could have been an important food resource (Tiffney 1984) . In modern tropical ecosystems, palm fruits are consumed by a wide variety of arboreal herbivores (birds, bats, squirrels, and monkeys), but so many fruits are produced that they are also eaten by terrestrial herbivores (rodents, pigs, deer, cattle, tapir; Corner 1966; Kahn and de Granville 1992) . A nutritional analysis of Sabal seeds determined that they are suitable for feeding pigs and ruminants (Arellano et al. 1992 ). There were few, perhaps no, arboreal herbivores in Late Cretaceous environments, and juvenile herbivorous dinosaurs were probably the most abundant small terrestrial herbivores. The beaks and shearing teeth of ceratopsians and hadrosaurs would have been well suited for gaining hold of and crushing the relatively tough palm fruits. Cretaceous palmetto palms, if they grew in dense ''thickets,'' as in some modern settings, would also have provided protective cover for the juvenile dinosaur herbivores.",

Indeed, at two of the sites (TMM 43163 and 41917) the seeds and bones occur in a fluvial sandstone bed, along with abraded tooth, bone, and wood fragments indicative of transport. However, at the other sites (TMM 42534 and WPA-1) the sedimentary matrix consists of finegrained organic-rich mudstone, accumulated in quiescent environments. At all four of these sites, bones of adult dinosaurs are also found, which together with the small seeds and juvenile dinosaur remains do not comprise a group of hydraulically equivalent objects. Hence, concentration by running water alone cannot explain these accumulations. We infer, therefore, that the association of palms with juvenile ceratopsians and hadrosaurs cannot be attributed simply to sedimentary sorting.",

Although palm foliage has also been described from the Late Cretaceous of Vancouver Island, British Columbia (Bell 1957 ), at ;60\u00b0N paleolatitude, this region 686 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCES is part of an accreted terrane that has been displaced northward tectonically from its Late Cretaceous position (Wyld et al. 2006) . Palm foliage has not been reported from wellstudied strata of this age in the Dinosaur Provincial Park area of southern Alberta , which was at ;58\u00b0N paleolatitude, or from higher latitudes in the interior of North America (Upchurch and Wolfe 1993) . Although pollen with possible palm affinities (e.g., Arecipites) has been reported from southern Alberta (Braman and Koppelhus 2005) , some have argued that these pollen genera may not be useful for paleoclimatic interpretation because plant families other than palms produce structurally identical simple pollen types (Upchurch et al. 1999) . If the northernmost Late Cretaceous limit of preserved palm foliage approximates their actual limit, then that was between 55\u00b0and 58\u00b0N paleolatitude, and the ;15\u00b0C MAT isotherm must have been at about that latitude ( fig. 6 ). The northernmost limit of Late Cretaceous crocodilians in North America is somewhat higher than that inferred for palms, between 58\u00b0and 65\u00b0N, which should be near the 14\u00b0C MAT isotherm (Markwick 1998) . Together, the distribution of palms and crocodilians indicates that the Late Cretaceous MAT at ;60\u00b0N was no colder than 15\u00b0C.",

Two distinct size classes among the seeds indicate that two species are represented. This remarkable occurrence reveals that the modern palmetto palms originated over 77 million years ago, shortly after the earliest appearance of palms in the fossil record. Palm leaves and stems morphologically consistent with Sabal also occur within the same stratigraphic interval and at the same sites that yield the seeds. The four seed-bearing sites are particularly notable because they also preserve remains of juvenile ceratopsian and hadrosaurian dinosaurs. Juvenile specimens are rare elsewhere in the Aguja Formation. This co-occurrence likely reflects an ecological association. Palm fruits are an important food resource for arboreal and terrestrial herbivores in modern tropical ecosystems, and fallen fruits would have provided juvenile dinosaurian herbivores with high-energy-value fodder necessary to sustain high growth rates with their limited gut capacities.",
