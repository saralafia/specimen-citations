For DCMI, it is also a return to Germany, as we came to Frankfurt in 1999 for one of the last invitational workshops, before the conference cycle began in 2001. A lot has happened since then, most notably the establishment of the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set as ISO standard 15836. Important steps since then include the development of the extended set of DCMI Terms, the DCMI Abstract Model and the Singapore Framework for Dublin Core Application Profiles. Since those days in 1999, the Dublin Core community has grown from a small and committed group of metadata pioneers into a large community of researchers and practitioners, who come together once a year to share experiences, discuss common issues and meet people from across the planet. This year in Berlin, the program has a dual focus, with attention for semantic applications (where the focus is on machine-readable information and co-operation between automated systems) and social applications (where the focus is on co-operation between people). We believe that both forms of co-operation are crucial for enabling the interoperability that is at the heart of our work on Dublin Core metadata. As usual, we hope that the event in Berlin will help people to gain understanding of approaches and developments in many places around the world, in many application domains and in many languages, and at the same time allow participants to get to know each other and build and extend personal and professional networks. On behalf of DCMI and its many contributors, I would like to wish everybody a very useful and pleasant conference.",

DC-2008 takes place in Berlin, Germany, a vibrant city in which cultural and scientific ideas are exchanged daily among the many sectors of society. Home to some of the world's most significant libraries and scientific research centers, Berlin is an ideal location for DC -2008, and for further linking the community of researchers, information professionals, and citizens who increasingly work with metadata to support the preservation, discovery, access, use, and re-use of digital information and information associated with physical artifacts. The theme for DC-2008 is \"Metadata for Semantic and Social Applications\". Standardized, schema-driven-metadata underlies digital libraries, data repositories, and semantic applications leading toward the Semantic Web. Metadata is also part of the fabric of social computing, which includes the use of wikis, blogs, and tagging. These two trends flow together in applications such as Wikipedia, where authors collectively create structured information that can be extracted and used to enhance access to and use of information sources. The papers in these proceedings address an array of significant metadata issues and questions related to metadata for semantic and social applications. The proceedings include twelve papers",

To make these images accessible to students and local history buffs, volunteers create a Dublin Core description that includes a title, description, and subject for each image, which renders them visible to automated harvesting utilities. But since this is a curated set of images about a particular place, the description could be enhanced with a record that describes the entire collection, using vocabulary from the Dublin Core Collection application profile, which includes a statement about access rights, pointers to associated collections, and a description of how the collection is accrued.",

In our hypothetical but realistic example, the owners of the images want to make their resources accessible to students or the curious public in a way that also preserves a piece of the historical record for future scholars. At the 2007 International Conference on Dublin Core and Metadata Applcations, project leaders from four continents reported on the design and use of application profiles to serve similar needs. For example, the SCROL (Singapore Cultural Resources Online) project designed a profile for managing access to images from multiple databases controlled by museums and archives (Wu, et al, 2007) . And the DRIADE project (Digital Repository of Information and Data for Evolution) developed a profile for the management of heterogeneous data relevant to the study of evolutionary biology .",

Technically, a namespace is an element defined in an XML schema, though it is often understood to refer to a named domain containing a list of terms that could be, but is not yet, expressed in a formal syntax. In our scenario, elements such as title or description belong to the Dublin Core namespace, while elements such as accrual method belong to the Dublin Core Collections namespace. Additional namespaces can be added if they are required for a more detailed description. For example, if the digitized photos are used in a high-school course on the history of Ohio, the description might be enhanced with an element such as audience from the Gateway to Educational Materials (GEM, 2008) namespace, whose value would specify that this resource is appropriate for high-school juniors and seniors. \u2022 Refine standard definitions-but only by making them narrower, not broader. For example, the GEM audience element is intended to annotate the grade level of a resource that can be used in a classroom. But since audience is a specialized description, it is formally linked to description, an element defined in the Dublin Core namespace that can replace it when a less detailed record is required. Because of this restriction on how definitions can be refined, the application profile permits complementary operations on the elements that comprise it. An element is refined or replaced when the element with the narrower meaning substitutes for the corresponding broader one. And an element is dumbed down when the element with the broader meaning is used instead. \u2022 Introduce no new data elements. Data elements may not be added to existing namespaces, but may only be introduced into a description by including more namespaces, as we've indicated. To extend our example, suppose the historical society needed to keep track of where the records describing the digitized images reside in a local database. If so, a metadata standards expert could define a namespace such as ChillicotheHistoricalSociety, which might contain a database-id element, and add it to the application profile. The technical infrastructure of the application profile addresses the needs of standards makers by creating incentives to use existing descriptive frameworks instead of creating new ones, preserving some degree of interoperability among records that describe similar resources. For systems designers, the application profile permits complex descriptions to be built up or collapsed using easily formalized operations.",

Second, we need to manage versions. Software that exploits the inheritance structure in an application profile can process records conforming to DC-Terms and DC-Simple schemas, or to these schemas with local extensions. Given that MARC can be extended in similar fashion, and that input or output records may have multiple structural realizations-as XML, ISO-2709, or RDF, among others-the number of record variants to be translated can quickly explode.

The resulting is strikingly simple. The metadata subject matter expert edits a spreadsheet, from which the corresponding executable code is automatically generated. As a consequence, about two dozen types of records can be processed in a software environment that is rarely touched by human hands, eliminating a software maintenance problem in the MARC-to-Dublin Core crosswalk with a model that can eventually be applied to other relationships. Figure 1 illustrates the process flow for the translation of a record by the Crosswalk Web Service. As shown at the top of the figure, the input is a small (and invalid) MARC record consisting of a single field and subfield, 522 a Northwest, encoded either in the MARC XML (LOC, 2007b) or ISO-2709 syntax. The output is an XML-encoded DC-Terms record containing the element DCTerms:spatial, shown at the bottom of the figure.

In the same row, the standards expert has recorded two additional facts about the Dublin Core-to-MARC relationship: that dc:coverage also maps to MARC 522 a, and that dcterms:spatial is 'dumbed down' to dc:coverage when a DC-Terms record requires a Dublin Core Simple manifestation. Thus, if the user with the record shown in Figure 1 had specified an output of DC-Simple instead of DC-Terms, the result would have been the record shown in Figure 2 . <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <simpledc xmlns dc='http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/> <dc:coverage>northwest</dc:coverage> </simpledc>",

In our sample record, the data northwest is found in a path ending with the elements 522 a and will be written to a path containing elements named coverage or spatial. Finally, in addition to a set of maps, a Seel script must have a <header>, which lists locally defined URIs where technical specifications for the source and target schemas can be resolved.

Both Seel files are complete scripts in the sense that they can be executed 'as is,' but a useful translation would usually contain many more maps than than those shown here.

To describe how maps to elements in multiple namespaces are added to the translation and how the translated record ends up with a mixture of elements from different sources, we need to point out a detail that appears in the DC-Terms script but is not present in the DC-Simple script. The <import> element, shown in bold type in Figure 3 , forces the inclusion of the maps defined in the DC-Simple script to create a comprehensive translation that consists of maps from both scripts. One effect of the import operation is to extend the maps involving the base standard-here, DC Simple-with a set of elements from a different namespace. In our example, the map to dcterms:audience appears in the DC-Terms output as the only new extension.

Recall that the <header> element in the DC-Terms script specifies dcterms as the namespace of the target, ensuring that the dcterms namespace is attached to the topmost element and is inherited by the target elements of each map in the translation-here, spatial and audience. An analogous operation happens when the DC-Simple script is executed. But when dcSimple2Marc.seel is imported into the DC-Terms script, the DC-Simple namespace is explicitly attached to every element that appears in DC-Simple but not in DC-Terms by a local namespace attribute, which overrides the default dcterms namespace that would have otherwise been assigned. Below is a DC-Terms record that contains the elements audience and subject. The Morfrom representation of a record produced by the application of the Seel scripts in Figure 3 is shown first (with the explicit namespace element shown in bold), then the DC-Terms XML syntax produced by one of the writer utilities in the Crosswalk Web Service. Note the treatment of the <subject> element, shown in bold at the bottom of Figure 4 , which demonstrates that the Morfrom element with a namespace attribute is represented in the output as an element from from the DC-Simple namespace, not the DC-Terms default. <record> <header><schema name=\"dcterms\" namespace='uri:ns:dcterms'/></header> <field name='audience'>high school students</field> <field name='subject' namespace='uri:ns:dc:1.1'><value>geography</value></field> </record> <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <dctermsset> <qualifieddc xmlns dcterms=\"http://purl.org/dc/terms\", xmlns dc=http://purl.org.dc/elements/1.1/ xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation=\" http://dublincore.org/schemas/xmls/qcdc/2006/01/06/qualifieddc.xsd\"> <dc:subject>geography</dc:subject> <dcterms:audience>high school students</dcterms:audience> </qualifieddc> </dctermsset> The Seel scripts in Figure 3 implement the smallest possible application profile, which contains elements from two namespaces, but this model can be extended if necessary. The DC-MARC translation at OCLC requires an additional set of elements that keep track of locally defined identifiers and other houskeeping information. To manage them, we defined elements in the OCLC-Admin namespace, mapped them to DC-Terms using a modified version of the spreadsheet like that shown in Figure 3 , and created the corresponding Seel scripts. Now the same spreadsheet can serve as input to four translations, all easily maintained because they are automatically generated: MARC to DC-Simple, MARC to DC-Terms, MARC to OCLC-Simple, which uses the DC-Simple and OCLC-Admin namespaces; and MARC to OCLC-Terms, which uses all three namespaces.",

Because <map> elements are self-contained and modular, they can carry id attributes that uniquely index them. Though this string can be any value, the maps in Figure 3 have straightforward names: dc-simple:1, dc-simple:2, dc-terms-1 and dc-terms-2. The map with the id value of dc-terms:1, which translates the spatial element, also has an override value of dc-simple:1, thus associating it with the map whose target is coverage.

                "text": "Before leaving the technical discussion, we need to point out that the spreadsheet shown in Figure 3 is much too simple for realistic data. When the relationships required for managing application profiles are stripped out, the spreadsheet does little more than model a one-to-one map of source to target elements: 521 a to audience, 650 a to subject, and so on. More complex relationships are usually required for mapping the bibliographic metadata that pass through OCLC's systems. For example, the mapping between source and target may be conditional on the value of data or the presence or absence of particular fields elsewhere in the record. And sometimes the data itself must be manipulated or identified with a special encoding scheme. Figure 3 shows the rest of the spreadsheet that the metadata standards expert fills out to create a production-quality MARC-to-Dublin Core translation. The greyed-out columns are the same as those in Figure 3 and indicate that the MARC tag 050 maps to subject regardless of whether it is interpreted as a member of the DC-Terms or DC-Simple namespace. The three columns on the right contain prompts that instruct the automated process to join the elements in MARC subfields a and b with a space and to execute this translation only if both indicators are present. The column labeled XSI Type specifies that the output data be interpreted as a LCC number, an encoding scheme listed in the DC-Terms namespace. The Seel map created from this entry is shown in Figure 6 . The additional details, shown in bold type, include the <context> element that checks for the existence of the indicators; a <value> element on the <source> that joins the subfields; and a <value> element on the <target>, whose attribute identifies the data as an LCC encoding. This example shows that even when a Seel map is expressive enough to model real-world relationships, the code remains fairly legible. The logic can be still represented transparently in a spreadsheet that is maintained by a non-programmer and automatically converted to executable code. <translation> <header> <sourceschema name='marc' namespace='uri:ns:marc:21'/> <targetschema name='dc' namespace='uri:ns:dc:1.1'/> </header> <map id=3'> <source> <mainpath> <branch bid='1'><step name='050'> <value><join with=' ' include='a,b'></join></value> </branch> </mainpath> <context bid='1'>.",

Users can test the results by submitting their own records to the public demo on the OCLC ResearchWorks page . Or they can use the Dublin Core export functions in the OCLC Connexion\u00ae Client, as shown in Figure 8 . Though the result is clean, the interest is not merely theoretical because the application profile solves a significant practical problem. The complex relationships among MARC, Dublin Core, and related namespaces resolve to a mutable set of translations involving some elements that require special definitions, some that are defined in public standards, and some that are required only for local maintenance-exactly what the application profile was designed for, according to Heery and Patel (2000) . With its focus on elements that can be mixed, matched, added, and redefined, the concepts that make up the application profile are a natural fit with the translation model of the Crosswalk Web Service, which attempts to achieve interoperability one element at a time by mapping those with similar meanings and manipulating their content when necessary. Before application profiles were defined and a translation model was developed that enforces transparency and reuse, the MARC-Dublin Core relationship at OCLC was managed with a large and brittle collection of pairwise translations-from DC-Terms to DC-Simple, from MARC to DC-Simple, MARC to DC-Terms, MARC to OCLC-Terms, and so on-a collection that multiplied quickly when structural variation was factored in.",

At a deeper level, we plan to exploit more of the element-oriented architecture in our translation processing, especially the URIs that are attached to each element and can carry information about the namespace it belongs to, the path to the element expressed in a formal syntax, and notes about local conditions. This is a large subject, but well worth attention because it will link our work to valuable implementations of metadata registries (Heery and Wagner, 2003) and annotation profiles (Palm\u00e9r, et al., 2007) .

In LCSH/MARC this information is represented explicitly, with original headings and subdivision 'facets'. In the LCSH/SKOS representation, headings with subdivisions are flattened into a literal, e.g. \"Drama--17th century\". This is an area where an extension of SKOS could be useful.",

The Architecture of the World Wide Web (Jacobs et al., 2004 ) makes a distinction between URIs for Information Resources (descriptions of things) and URIs for Non-Information Resources (the things themselves). SKOS concepts (e.g. Mathematics) are clearly not available on the web, so special care must be taken in minting URIs for them. Sauermann (2008) provides specific guidance on how to make resources available on the semantic web. As described in 2.2, URLs of the pattern http://lcsh.info/{lccn}#concept are created for each LCSH/SKOS concept. The use of hash URIs for SKOS concept simplifies the web server implementation; since the server isn't required to redirect using a 303 See Other HTTP status code, when the URI for the concept is requested.",

However LCSH/SKOS has only one type of entity skos:Concept to represent all of these. As an RDF vocabulary, SKOS could easily be extended with new sub-classes of skos: Concept: lcsh:TopicalConcept, lcsh:GeographicConcept, lcsh:GenreConcept, and lcsh:ChronologicalConcept. In addition LCSH/MARC uses pre-coordination to assemble authorized subject headings from the combination of other headings. These pre-coordinations use a variety of subfields to capture the type of facet used in a heading. Unfortunately this information is lost in SKOS since the skos:prefLabel property has for its range, and joins the subfields together with a '-'. Users of LCSH/SKOS will undoubtedly want to be able to identify the components of pre-coordinated concepts. Some LCSH/MARC records represent authorized subfield headings (180, 181, 182, 185) , which were ignored by our initial conversion routine. It would be useful to represent these concepts using a SKOS extension. SKOS currently has an open issue (Miles, 2007) to explore how to represent coordinated concepts in SKOS, or to provide an extension pattern.

Most of these collections include sets of metadata records created by volunteering LIS students. Searching and browsing IPL collections are based on the metadata database. Because of this, it has been a priority for the IPL to create and maintain high-quality metadata within its current setting. The metadata will continue to be created by LIS students to support its mission as a teaching and learning environment for the Consortium member schools, yet high-quality metadata must be maintained to support its service to the public.

Current IPL metadata consist of a set of well documented fields such as title, abstract, keywords, and subject headings. The subject headings are not a formally defined thesaurus but a set of loosely developed category terms. While the subject headings present a simple hierarchical view to the IPL collections, they do not provide strong associative and semantic relations among the headings and collections that a good thesaurus would otherwise provide. Thus, we sought solutions to build additional semantic relations among keywords, subject headings, topics and digital resources (Web pages) to enhance the IPL metadata. We particularly explored how context might be employed for metadata and how the context information might be extracted from both the semantic analysis of digital collections and the analysis of user's search logs.",

It is hypothesized that semantics can be extracted through lexical or statistical analysis of language and its structures. The meanings then can be represented by the data and structures obtained through the analysis. Similarly, semantics of metadata can be considered as the relation between metadata records and the content they represent. Metadata records are essentially \"data + structures\" that describe and represent various features of digital objects, including their content, context, and structures (Gill, et al. 1998) . The semantics of metadata come from multiple sources. The first is the metadata standard. A metadata standard represents a consensus of how a specific type of digital objects should be described structurally. It provides a schema that specifies the metadata's namespaces, formats, required elements and allowable attributes, etc. Through naming and structuring the metadata elements, each standard provides a semantic framework that the user can \"fill-in\" values to create metadata records. The second source of the semantics comes from the metadata creation process. Typically, the standards do not give details on how a metadata record should be created. It is up to the metadata creator (most likely a human being) who interprets the content of the resource to be described and selects terms most appropriate for each entry of the metadata record. The human intelligence in this process provides the most significant semantic associations to connect metadata records to the content. The third semantic source of metadata is the semantics of the language. In particular, when a controlled vocabulary is used to create metadata records, the rich semantic relationships established within the controlled vocabulary enrich the semantics of metadata significantly.",

A theme should be considered as a special topic or as \"a topic in context.\" It can be used to provide contextual links to topics. It can become a higher level of subject indicators along with keywords, subject headings, and topics. In this research, we simply view a Topic as a subject with a name and multiple slots of properties. The properties may include different types of keywords generated from multiple sources either manually or automatically. Then, we view a Theme as a special type of topics that unites several topics around a theme. Unlike in Topic Maps where the center of the universe is \"topic,\" we are exploring to have the \"theme\" as the main unit that can have its own descriptive metadata and let topics to be \"characteristics\" of the theme. Our assumption is that users would be more interested in \"topics in context\" than topics. When a searcher sends a query to a collection, the searcher will likely be more satisfied to retrieve themes that provide specific topics and resources relevant to the query than to retrieve only the resources that match the user's query directly. Figure 1 illustrates the hierarchical framework for subject representation in metadata. As mentioned above, the properties to describe topics and themes can be from multiple sources. In this study, we only include three sets: a set of topic signatures automatically generated from a collection, a set of keywords manually assigned, and a set of keywords identified and selected from the previous user's query terms. Details on topic signature generation will be introduced in Section 4. Each set of keywords can have different weights for the purpose of indexing and retrieval. The topic can also include properties of relevant resources (occurrences), either manually selected or automatically retrieved and inserted by search engines. For the IPL, two types of resource URLs are included as properties of a topic: URLs within the IPL and those outside the IPL. ",

Due to the different focuses of different collections, the metadata used to describe the same terms or objects may vary from collection to collection. Our language model is able to capture the different semantic associations among topic signatures in different collections. Table 1 shows two topic signatures for the same topics in two different collections. For example, we conducted the semantic mapping on two of IPL collections: the IPL general collection and the IPL collection for Youth and Teens. The mapping results show strong \"context interpretations.\" For example, the topic \"reading\" in the general (adult) collection is closely associated with \"classics,\" \"review,\" \"humor,\" \"literary,\" etc., while the same topic in the collection for teens is closely associated with \"children's literature,\" \"stories,\" \"folklore,\" etc. Similarly, the topic signatures show that for the health issue, adults are more concerned about \"mental health,\" \"health care,\" \"disease,\" etc. and the teens are more concerned about \"fitness,\" \"exercise,\" \"nutrition,\" and \"stress.\" When creating metadata for different collections, such suggestions of collection-based related terms would be very useful. Furthermore, for each keyword, the language model creates a semantic profile by mapping the keyword to a set of related terms in the specific collection. For example, as shown in TABLE 2, in the IPL Teens collection, the semantic profile of the keyword \"stress\" contains a list of highly associated words, including \"depression,\" \"anxiety,\" \"health,\" \"disorder,\" \"eat,\" etc. The number attached to each term gives",

The evaluation of the value added by mappings and the results of an information retrieval experiment using human generated terminology mappings is described in (Mayr & Petras, 2008b , to be published).

Since ASFA is a specialized thesaurus in the area of fisheries and aquaculture, the mapping with AGROVOC resulted in a mapping with the fisheries-related terms of AGROVOC. The mappings were extracted by means of the SCARLET system (cf. section 3) and were of three types: superclass/subclass, disjointness and equivalence. Evaluation was carried out manually by two FAO experts, in two runs: first with a sample of 200 randomly selected mappings, then with a second sample of 500 mappings. The experts were also supported in their evaluation by the graphical interface. The results obtained were rather poor (precision was 0.16 in the first run of the evaluation and 0.28 in the second run), especially if compared with the high results obtained by the same system with the mapping of AGROVOC and NALT (cf. section 3). The hypothesis formulated to explain this low performance is related to the low degree of overlap between AGROVOC and ASFA, 13 and that the terms in ASFA may not be well covered by the Semantic Web, as required by SCARLET. Cases like this clearly show how beneficial it would be to gain a clear understanding of when manual mapping is more advisable than automatic mapping (as in the case of the AGROVOC-ASFA mapping) or the other way around (as in the case of the AGROVOC -NALT mapping analyzed in this paper).",

The mapping has been carried out using the SKOS Mapping Vocabulary 14 (version 2004) and addresses another very important issue in mapping thesauri and other KOS: multilinguality. AGROVOC has been translated from English to Chinese, whereas CAT has been translated from Chinese to English. This creates potential problems as the following example illustrates: CAT ' '/'Oryza sativa' was originally mapped to AGROVOC 'Oryza sativa'. However, upon closer examination, the Chinese lexicalization in AGROVOC of 'Oryza sativa', which is ' ', appears to be the broader term of the CAT Chinese term. Moreover, a search in AGROVOC for the CAT Chinese term ' ', shows the English translation as 'Paddy'. These discrepancies indicate the weakness of the above mentioned procedure and the necessity of cross checking all lexicalizations in both languages. Such cases pose hard problems for automatic mapping algorithms and can only be addressed with human support at the moment.",

Details about the procedure can be found in .

The system that performed best at the OAEI 2007 food task was Falcon-AO. It found around 80% of all equivalence relations using lexical matching techniques. However, it was unable to find any hierarchical relations. Also, it did not find relations that required background knowledge to discover. This led to a recall score of around 50%. The SCARLET system was the only system that found hierarchical relations using the semantic web search engine Watson 16 (Sabou et al., 2007) . Many of the mappings returned by SCARLET were objectively speaking valid, but more generic than any human would suggest. This led to a very low recall score.",

Bilateral relations are not necessarily symmetrical. E.g. the term 'Computer' in system A is mapped to term 'Information System' in system B, but the same term 'Information System' in system B is mapped to another term 'Data base' in system A. Bilateral mappings are only one approach to treat semantic heterogeneity; compare and (Zeng & Chan, 2004) . The approach allows the following 1:1 or 1:n mappings: Equivalence (=) means identity, synonym, quasi-synonym; Broader terms (<) from a narrower to a broad; Narrower terms (>) from a broad to a narrower; Association (^): mapping between related terms; and Null (0) which means that a term can not be mapped to another term.

Both vocabularies were analysed in terms of topical and syntactical overlap before the mapping started. All mappings in the GESIS-IZ approach are established by researchers, terminology experts, domain experts, and postgraduates. Essential for a successful mapping is the complete understanding of the meaning and semantics of the terms and the intensive use of the internal relations of the vocabularies concerned. This includes performing lots of simple syntactic checks of word stems but also semantic knowledge, i.e. to lookup synonyms and other related or associated terms. The establishment of mappings is based on the following practical rules and guidelines: 1. During the mapping of the terms, all existing intra-thesaurus relations (including scope notes) have to be used. 2. The utility of the established relations has to be checked. This is especially important for combinations of terms (1:n relations). 3. 1:1 relations are prior. 4. Word groups and relevance adjustments have to be made consistently. In the end the semantics of the mappings are reviewed by experts and samples are empirically tested for document recall and precision (classical information retrieval definition). Some examples of the rules in the KoMoHe approach can be found in (Mayr & Petras, 2008a , to be published).",

In any case, we can make the rather trivial statement that the Geographic group turns out to be rather simple, i.e. there seems to be an overall consensus on country names and other geographic concepts (in our case, the geographic group consists basically of country names). However, we have to be careful with this statement, especially when it comes to geopolitics. Borders of countries and similarly sensitive concepts might be called the same in two systems (and therefore seem simple and would be suggested by an automatic mapping tool with high security), but actually defined differently and mapping the two could raise sensitive issues. Take for example 'Taiwan': In AGROVOC, the non-preferred term 'China (Taiwan)' refers to the preferred term 'Taiwan', which has the broader term (BT) 'China', whereas in NALT 'Taiwan' uf 'China (Taiwan)' has the broader term 'East Asia'. Another example, which is currently an issue, is the concept 'Macedonia'. It has been used in the Codex Alimentarius 17 to refer to the former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia. However, since there is also a region in Greece, which is called Macedonia, the Greek authorities have requested the Codex Alimentarius to use 'The former Yugoslavian Republic of' in the name of the concept. Moreover, country definitions are very time dependent. How a user might best map geographical terms depends on the use case. For some purposes automatic mapping is a quick and good solution. For others it might be better to map all geographical terms manually, which is generally feasible due to the relatively small number of countries in the world (as compared, for example, to plant species). 21.18% 110.59%(9) 0.00% 0Miscellaneous 1.45%(4) 0.36% 113.77% 383.26% 9Analyzing the other groups listed in the table leads to the few first statements: First of all, we can say that in general, Biological/Chemical like Geographical terminology is fairly easy to map (over 60% rated as Simple). This result makes sense, since like for geographical concepts there is probably a good consensus in the world on names of biological entities and chemicals 18 . Taking into account the alternative labels, this statement also holds for the group of taxonomic terminology mapping. Apparently, in the German language there are more discrepancies on the usage of preferred versus non-preferred labels and synonyms than in the English language. The Miscellaneous group (including the majority of mappings) appears to be the most difficult one: 13.77% of the automatically suggested mappings were even wrong, and it shows the highest percentage of Hard Background Knowledge mappings.",

These are in general more difficult to find than equivalence mappings (either very easy or very difficult, because Hard Background Knowledge may be required), and therefore pose a big problem to automatic mapping algorithms. The SWD part on agriculture is also considerably smaller than the AGROVOC or NAL thesaurus and therefore many broader and narrower mappings are possible. Automatic mapping approaches have difficulty with such discrepancies. Apparently, subterms are often a good lexical clue for a < or > relation, but how does a computer decide which of the subterms is the superclass? Sometimes it is easy because one of the subterms is an adjective, while the other is a noun (e.g. 'mechanical damage' is a damage), but sometimes both are nouns (e.g. 'Bos taurus' is a Bos, not a taurus, but 'fruit harvester' is a harvester), and this is hard to parse. There are also cases where lexical inclusion can bring confusion, for example 'Meerrettich' (horseradish is Armoracia rusticana) and 'Meerrettichbaum' (horseradish tree is Moringa oleifera), as they refer to completely different concepts. Eventually, this problem might be solved by machine learning, but current mapping systems do not have any functionality to detect various common naming conventions.",

The automatic mappings with this rating accumulate to less than 4%. Table 5 shows the numbers of wrong automatic mapping suggestions.

This mapping has been rated 'alt label', since, for example, in AGROVOC, 'Marketing Strategy' is the non-descriptor of 'Marketing Techniques'. This case makes it easy for an automatic classifier. However, this might also be misleading. In the agriculture domain, it might be correct to declare equivalence between these terms. However, in another domain there might actually be no mapping or at most a related term mapping. For example, in the business area, marketing strategies differ from marketing techniques substantially in that the strategies are long term objectives and roadmaps whereas the marketing techniques are operational techniques used in the marketing of certain products. For an automatic mapping algorithm, this is difficult to detect and alternative labels as they are sometimes found in thesauri, might be misleading.",

However, in this case, the human knowledge could be found by a mapping system, if it would exploit the German Wikipedia. On the page about Falke 19 , it states: \"Die Falken (Gattung Falco) sind Greifv\u00f6gel...\". 3. Mapping rated Hard Background Knowledge. In SWD the term 'Laubfresser' (folivore) which does not exist in AGROVOC or in NALT had to be mapped to the broader term 'Herbivore'. This is another example where Hard Background Knowledge is needed. 4. Sometimes terms which seem to match exactly are incorrectly machine-mapped, for example when they are homonyms. Example: 'Viola' -in AGROVOC it is the taxonomic name of a plant (violets) while in SWD it refers to a musical instrument. In this case the relationship is 0. Sense disambiguation techniques such as the ontology partitioning performed by some of the current mapping systems, like Falcon-AO, should be able to solve most of these ambiguities by recognizing that none of the broader or narrower terms of 'Viola' and 'violet' are similar. Some of the mappings of course will remain impossible for automatic methods that do not exploit sources of background knowledge, for example one of the AGROVOC-SWD mappings that found that 'Kater' (tomcat) is a 'm\u00e4nnliches Individuum' (male individual).",

What is the distribution of (the) species on earth? How has this distribution changed over time? What environmental conditions are needed by a species to survive?",

                "text": "There are over 1 billion specimens in museums worldwide collected over the past several hundred years. These specimens have labels (see Figure 1 for an example label) and catalog entries containing critical information including, the name of the species, the location and date of collection, revised nomenclature when the taxonomic name was changed, the habitat where it was found such as marsh or meadow as well as many other pieces of information. This knowledge will allow us to better predict the impact of global climate change on species distribution (Beaman, 2006) . However, only a small fraction of this specimen data is available online. Consequently, digitization has become a high priority globally. Recent advances in digital imaging make it possible to quickly create images of specimen labels. However, the usefulness of the scanned images is limited since images cannot be easily manipulated and transformed into useful information in databases and full-text information systems. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) has proven to be useful but also challenging because of the age and variety of museum specimens. As is the situation with biomedical literature (Subramaniam, 2003) , because of the volume and heterogeneity of the data it is difficult and expensive for humans to type in and extract critical information by hand. Automated and semi-automated procedures are required. \"Results indicate that metadata experts are in favor of using automatic metadata generation, particularly for metadata that can be created accurately and efficiently. \u2026 metadata functionalities which participants strongly favored is running automatic algorithm(s) initially to acquire metadata that a human can evaluate and edit,\" (Greenberg, 2006) .",

In general, the techniques developed here could be adapted to any information extraction situation of noisy text and with weakly ordered elements. In this paper, we discuss noisy-text extraction in more complex documents than in most prior works (e.g. Kahan,1987; Takasu, 2002; Takasu, 2003) . Most noisy-text classification research is focused on how to automatically detect and correct the OCR errors, text segmentation, text categorization and text modeling (e.g. Takasu, 2002; Takasu, 2003; Foster, 2007) . Some techniques that are used to reduce the effect of OCR introduced imperfections include: combining prior knowledge, N-grams, morphological analysis, and spatial information. Our research is focused on how to automatically extract metadata from noisy text using machine learning with limited training data. Since the output of handwriting OCR is still extremely poor, we limit our analysis below to labels that are primarily type written. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of exploiting tags within labels, and collection segmentation to improve performance.",

DwC is an extensible data exchange standard for taxon occurrence data including specimens and observations of (once) living organisms. DwC has been adopted as a standard by the Biodiversity Informatics Standards (formerly the Taxonomic Database Working Group: http://darwincore.calacademy.org/). We extend the DwC to 74 fields that are particularly useful in museum specimen label context. Nearly 100% of the original label content can be assigned to some element. The 74 elements and their meanings are presented in Table 1 . Some codes are optionally preceded with an \"R\" to indicate re-determination or appended with an \"L\" to indicate a field element label/identifier as discussed in section 4.3. The key problems with extracting information in this domain are heterogeneity of the label formats, open-ended vocabularies, OCR errors, and multiple languages. Collectors and museums have created label formats for hundreds of years so label elements can occur in almost any position and the any typography and script: hand written, typed and computer generated. In addition to typographic OCR errors, in these labels OCR error are also artifacts of format and misalignment (e. g. See ns(Noise) elements for OCR errors in the following xml example). These errors have several causes including: the later addition of data values to preprinted labels, label formats often included elements that are not horizontally aligned or because new labels were added to the original, making it difficult for OCR software to properly align the output. Following is the OCR output of the label in Figure 1 XML markup of the OCRed text:",

The F-score is widely used in information retrieval and extraction evaluation and is calculated based on precision and recall (see following F equation). Generally speaking, the higher the F-score, the better the results. Precision is defined as the ratio of tokens correctly assigned to a class divided by the total number assigned to the class. The recall is the ratio of correctly classified tokens for a class divided by the total number of tokens of that class. F = 2*precision*recall/(precision + recall) (F equation) Since trainings and validation data is expensive and time consuming to gather, K-fold crossvalidation is frequently used to evaluate machine learning effectiveness in order to get more reliable results. Cross-validation is the statistical practice of partitioning a sample of training data into subsets so that machine learning is performed on one subset, while the other subset(s) are used to confirm the validity of the machine learning output (Witten, 2005) . 5-fold, 10-fold and leave-one-out cross validation are very popular. In 5-fold validation the system randomly partitions the training set into five equal subsets. On each of 5 iterations, the machine learner will use one of the subsets for testing and use the other 4 sets as the training set.",

The most relevant prior research has been conducted on U.S. Postal address and bibliographic data. (e.g. Lewis, 1994; Frasconi, 2002; Borkar, 2001; Han, 2003; Hu, 2005 , Cui, 2005 . Borkar et al. developed a HMM system, similar to an algorithm we use, to handle the information extraction task (Borkar, 2001) . The methods for \"segmenting unformatted text records into structured elements\" they proposed are successful in solving a simple U.S. postal address problem. They reported F-scores of 99%, 88.9% and 83.7% respectively on datasets of USPS addresses, Student addresses and Company addresses. For bibliographic data, they achieved an F-score of 87.3% for 205 records from Citeseer by using 100 training records. Han et al. implement a Support Vector Machine as the classifier to extract mainly Dublin Core metadata from Citeseer and EbizSearch, using 10-fold cross-validation on 500 training headers and 435 test headers. Their method achieves an overall accuracy of 92.9%. Cui's dissertation (2005) demonstrated that domain knowledge gained from machine learning models in one publication is very useful for improving the performance of IE in another publication in the same field. This is a necessary property of some machine learning algorithms we need to move the HERBIS Leaning System across herbarium collections. Table 2 documents some of the differences between the address and the museum label information extraction problem and demonstrates the need for the new algorithms discussed below. This is an analysis of 200 U.S. addresses and 200 HERBIS (http://www.herbis.org/) \"printed\" label instances. The work cited above demonstrated that 200 records are sufficient for this type of analysis. The US address data and museum labels are randomly selected from regular USPS mail envelops and the HERBIS label database which includes more than 20,000 records from the Yale Peabody Herbarium. This herbarium was founded in 1864 and containing 350,000 specimens. We would expect similar results in similar Herbaria collections. Address labels and Museum labels were processed in exactly the same manner: image scanning followed by OCR and then markup. The museum label data is substantially more complex than the postal data (see Table 2 ). The museum labels differ from prior datasets along a number of dimensions:",

There may be thousands of different formats of labels that have evolved over the last couple hundred years and now reside in museum collections. However, each collector has their own preferred format of label. This means that a particular museum will tend to have a relatively finite number of collectors supplying the museum at any one time and therefore will have a finite number of label formats represented in the collection. Further, if many museums are digitizing labels, then eventually, there will be corrected sets of labels for many collectors. It may be possible to develop multiple training modules each of which specializes in a particular collector and therefore label format. This observation leads to the hypotheses that the specialist model will perform better for records by the same author than for a generalized model trained on a random data collection and That fewer training examples will be required to reach a given level of performance using all labels from the same collector than would be required for a mixed collection of collectors.

This pool can be subdivided into sub-collections to construct new specialist models (for particular collectors or collections). When the end-user sends a museum image to the server, the server would perform OCR, classify based on collector and then process the document with the appropriate collector or collection model. If a specialized collector module is not contained in the server, the information will be extracted from the label using the generic model based on a random sample of labels (see specialist learning algorithm below). For this strategy to work, it is necessary to be able to categorize labels into subsets prior to the information extraction step so that the highest performance model could be used for extraction.

The dashed top line in figure 6 is the performance of 200 records independent of iteration. Regular expressions were applied to the 20,000 Yale digitized labels to identify the approximately 100 examples with the collector's name \"A. H. Curtiss\" who is a well-known collector and botanist. HLS was trained on 10 examples and then 5-fold evaluation used to measure the F-Score. This procedure was repeated 10 times, adding 10 new labels on each iteration producing a training set of 20, 30 and so on until a hundred were used in a training set. The results are presented in the solid curved line, \"Specialist Model(10+).\" Note that after the specialist model reaches 80 training records it matches the performance of the generic model trained on 200 randomly selected records. The dashed curved line at the bottom, Generic Model(10+), shows the performance of the learning algorithm when given comparable numbers of randomly selected training examples (not necessarily Curtiss) on each iteration. The shaded area is the advantage of using the specialist classification model. If we extended this dashed line out to 200 cases we would see the general model equal to the 200 case general Yale model. This is not demonstrated here since only 100 Curtiss examples exist in the 20,000 labels digitized at Yale. As predicted, fewer training examples are needed to reach a given level of performance using the Curtiss Specialist collection than a random collection. Given the effectiveness of the NB pre-classifier introduced in the previous section to identify collectors we should be able to create a specialist model for any collector. In fact, we can create a swarm of models for an arbitrary number of collectors and associated label types. The fact that there are only 100 Curtiss labels out of the 20,000 at Yale is a reflection of the fact that there are many labels and many formats.",

While the current system is a necessary prerequisite for an effective metadata generating system the machine learning swarm has not been implemented or tested with live data. Also, no sufficient user interface exists to deliver a functioning system. In creating such an interface a new set of research questions arise. Standard precision, recall and F-Scores are not sufficient for evaluating interactive systems. A more appropriate measure for botanists would be: How much time this system could save the expert when creating metadata? Important variables are the number of human corrections required per label, the time required to correctly complete a fixed number of labels, number of training examples and number of error corrections needed to meet some performance criteria such as a 90% F-score and other measures.",

Influences such as the federal No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, testing regimes such as the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) and state high-stakes testing are major drivers in the developing call for learning resources that assist teachers in meeting the 20 There are two broad classes of resources of concern to the ASN-curriculum standards and content standards. \" [A] content standard describes what students should know and be able to do; a curriculum standard describes what should take place in the classroom. Specifically, curriculum standards address instructional technique or recommended activities as opposed to knowledge and skill per se (Marzano & Kendall, 1997) .\" \"Content standards specify 'what students should know and be able to do.' They indicate the knowledge and skills-the ways of thinking, working, communicating, reasoning, and investigating, and the most important and enduring ideas, concepts, issues, dilemmas, and knowledge essential to the discipline-that should be taught and learned in school (National Education Goals Panel, 1993)\" demands of demonstrable accountability lurking behind the articulated state standards (Sutton, 2008) . 21 The social and political thrust in the U.S. behind the national move toward accountability in K-12 education has roots in standards-based systems of teaching and learning. Since achievement standards reflect the knowledge, skills and habits of mind that K-12 students are expected to attain in a particular content area and at a given grade level, clear articulation of achievement standards coupled with rigorous assessment are at the heart of the systemic school initiatives in the U.S. under NCLB. NCLB invests states with the responsibility to create the standards for proficiency and then assess students against those standards in the core subjects of mathematics and language arts starting in 3rd grade. While the U.S. has what are loosely called \"national standards,\" they are the result of standards-making activities of non-governmental organizations and bear no resemblance in terms of political force to the official national standards found in other countries around the world.",

This information enables collections to function not just as aggregates of individual data items but as independent entities that are in some sense more than the sum of their parts, as intended by their creators and curators (Curral, Moss & Stuart, 2005; Lagoze, et al. 2006 Palmer, 2004 . Collection-level metadata, which represents this information in computer processable form, is thus critical to the distinctive intellectual and cultural role of collections as something more than a set of individual objects.",

The registry currently contains records for 200 collections. An item-level metadata repository was also developed, which has harvested 76 collections using the OAI-PMH protocol.

We conducted studies on how content contributors conceived of the roles of collection descriptions in digital environments , and preliminary usability work. These studies and related work on the CIC Metadata Portal 25 , suggest that while the boundaries around digital collections are often blurry, many features of collections are important for helping users navigate and exploit large federated repositories, and that collection and item-level descriptions should work in concert to benefit certain kinds of user queries .",

Using an information quality framework proposed by Stvilia et al. 2004) we found that the relational or contextual information quality dimensions-that is, the dimensions that depend on relationships between the information and an aspect of its use or context-were particularly problematic . Unlike intrinsic information quality dimensions in which the information can be measured in relation to a reference standard (such as a date encoding standard), measurement of relational quality dimensions are dependent on what context an item was meant for and its use within that context. In this environment, collection-level metadata could supply some of that context, given a better understanding of the relationships between collection and item level metadata.",

The first phase is developing a logic-based framework of collection/item metadata relationships that classifies metadata into categories with associated rules for propagating or constraining information between collection and item levels.

Our analysis seems to support van Rijsbergen and Lalmas, at least for the applications being considered here. When conditionals are used in definitions, or in specification design and conceptual analysis, they do indeed nest at the problematic level, and in the problematic location (the definiens of a definition, or, more generally, in the antecedent of a larger conditional (when \"=df\" is read \"if and only if\").",

Obvious examples are metadata indicating that a collection was developed according to some particular method, designed for some particular purpose, representative in some respect of a domain, has certain summary statistical features, and so on.

A good example of the influence of a specific technology on content is the character field length limitations of punch cards fed into mainframes in the 1970's, the effects of which are still felt today in some legacy data sets. Technological evolutions have also been accompanied by (and partially engendered) a shift in the profile of professionals working with these tools to document collections. There is, for example, a clear tendency within cultural institutions to give the repetitive work of metadata creation to administrative and technical staff, apprentices or student workers, whereas collection description used to be performed by specifically trained staff members. In multi-lingual countries such as Belgium one also has to consider the complexity of collections being described sometimes in one language, sometimes in another, depending on the mother tongue of the staff. Under these circumstances vast repositories of metadata records have been created and migrated from one platform to another, with little or no information regarding their consistency, completeness and accuracy.",

Initially, most museum web-presences were limited to basic institutional information. Only a very limited number of museums published their metadata in the same way as libraries, which offered their users an OPAC. But the growing tendency to aggregate thematically or geographically related metadata from libraries, archives and museums with the use of OAI-PMH has raised the pressure on museums to publish or distribute all of their available metadata. The disappointing quality of search results and the minimal descriptions attached to retrieved objects within such projects has led to a discussion on issues surrounding the consistency, accuracy and completeness of metadata.",

Among the options offered on this page we especially would like to point out the possibility to visualize the data cleaning statistics as graphs representing the evolution through time of the number of suspect authors, duplicated records and catalog numbers ( see FIG. 2 ).

Put simply, one cannot expect a traditional return on investment of digitization projects in the sense that the market validation of digital cultural heritage is not likely to make up for the investments made for the digitization. But this does not mean the sector cannot learn something from more economically viable domains, where data-profiling tools offer a means to introduce more accountability through statistical monitoring.

But how can this be judged without sufficient knowledge of user expectations? Log files of user queries are haphazardly used for research purposes (Cunningham and Mahoui, 2000) , but the logs have little real impact on collection description. Recent experiments with user-generated metadata such as user comments and folksonomies offer an interesting step in this direction (van Hooland, 2005) . In a broad sense logs of user queries, comments and tags could also be considered as metadata linked to the collection, to which data profiling can be applied in order to more easily detect patterns and recurrences.",

It is the core-business of heritage holders to manage and facilitate access to historical collections, for which it can be very time-consuming and sometimes impossible to document the origin and intent of the collection. Sometimes old documentation can exist, but the updating of legacy metadata is a necessity. This illustrates the problem of the ever-extendibility of metadata, in the sense that metadata themselves have to be documented as the reality and its definition evolve throughout time. But administrative or legislative institutions, which are obliged to retain their historical data, are also confronted with shifting definitions, domains and attributes of concepts such as, for example, unemployment, nationality or retirement (Boydens, 2001 ). The unstructured character of cultural heritage information is also blamed for the difficulty of inserting documentation into rigorously defined database fields. The extensive work in recent years on metadata models has attempted to structure as much as possible the documentation process by providing clear-cut definitions of metadata fields and sets of possible values (e.g with controlled vocabularies). But still, the descriptions that contain key information for users are contained in free-text fields. It is precisely the automated analyses of unstructured text which poses problems when assessing metadata quality.",

The manual analysis of a limited sample of the complete set of metadata records has been a way to gather interesting indications (Shreeves et all, 2005) . However, this manual approach has two obvious disadvantages: 1) it is too time consuming (and thus too expensive) and 2) it only offers a \"photograph\" of a sample of the metadata records at one specific moment in time. Therefore, we will focus only on practical semi-automated approaches that can repeatedly analyze the totality of a given metadata set. Tennant (2004) proposes a minimal, pragmatic set of analysis functions to be applied on metadata and specifies queries to be computed such as the total number of occurrences of a certain value or patterns across records (e.g. all records with \"x\" in the \"y\" field do not have a \"z\" field). The application of such scripts or queries on large numbers of metadata records produces results which are difficult to grasp without the aid of visualization software. Dushay and Hillmann present a tool that can translate the results of queries upon a large collection of records into a human-readable form that allows the detecting of patterns and the extent of the problems . Several researchers have also worked on metadata transformation and enrichment, especially in the context of aggregated content projects. report, for example, on how harvested records can be transformed to be of higher use in the context of an OAI service provider.",

We are interested to see which results can be obtained by using an opensource general-purpose data profiling tool, available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/dataprofiler/ that works in three steps. First, the analysis to perform on the dataset has to be set up by creating an XML profile specification file (see figure 3) in which is specified which analysis runs on which column of the dataset. Five analyses are at our disposal, which we will present with the help of examples from our test collection. In a second step, the profiler itself is launched, which will read the XML file and store the result of the profiling into a local repository and the information about the profiling execution into a catalog file. The catalog file is used to record what profile specification (.xml file) was used as a basis for profiling and to retrieve the results from the local repository. Third, the visualizer is run to view the profile execution results. These can then be exported for further analysis in other tools.",

The accession number in the case of our data set has to correspond to the following fixed syntax: The different date fields also offer an excellent opportunity to apply the pattern analysis. There is a total number of 52 different ways to encode the date_of_collecting. This is due to the fact that other information is also saved within the field in some cases. Obviously, this practice should be avoided. Table 2 represents the 10 most frequent patterns used to represent the date when an item was acquired and clearly demonstrates the need to standardize the input of dates. The same conclusion can be drawn from the results of the pattern analysis when applied on the dimension field (see table 3 ). Measures are not standardized (both mm and cm are used) and apparently no rules were laid down regarding the syntax. As in the case of the problem with dates, this incoherence makes the searching difficult, not to say completely impossible.

They may also be repeating, and it is possible to impose an intrinsic data type (text, integer or floating point number, date) as well as bounds and pattern-based input validation rules. 3. Automatic extraction of metadata from uploaded media files. 4. Extensive support for authority lists and controlled vocabularies. A tool is included to import Getty Art and Architecture Thesaurus (AAT) data files. We are currently evaluating several strategies for integration of the metadata quality tools described in this paper with OpenCollection. These range from straightforward inclusion of metrics generated by our tool in OpenCollection's reporting system to more interactive approaches built into the metadata creation workflow itself. Examples of the latter include:",

A potential source of semantical level information could be any possible interdependencies connecting the resources. Digital resources stored in a repository are not completely independent from each other; they are connected with structural or semantical relations. Especially, in digital resources constituting assemblies (like educational resources registered in a repository as collections, e.g. SCORM), or aggregations (e.g. a web page containing an image and an animation) these relations among the resources create a net of interdependencies, which affect their metadata records, accordingly. These interdependencies are expressed as logic rules the validity of which influences metadata quality and will be dealt with in this paper.",

They designate the most frequently used fields and values attributed to these fields. While not directly associated with quality, the statistical indices produced provide an insight of the efficiency of the repositories examined. In this regard, (Greenberg et al., 2001) reports on a study that examined the ability of resource authors to create acceptable -quality metadata in an organizational setting using manual evaluation by experts. Dushay & Hillman (2003) studies the issue of quality by pinpointing deficiencies that degrade it. In the same work, the use of a graphical tool to visualize the deficiencies in a repository level is also proposed. The issue of quality assurance is treated in (Barton, Currier & Hey, 2003; Guy, Powell & Day, 2004; Currier et al., 2004) and general principles and guidelines for the creation of metadata, in order to meet the functional requirements of the application in which they are used, are provided. In the context of quality assurance, (Hillman & Phipps, 2007) discusses the contribution of application profiles as a means for exposing and enforcing metadata quality.",

However, they have been used for automatic metadata generation. Duval & Hodgins (2004) points out that a resource's metadata may derive from the metadata of related resources. Hatala & Richards (2003) refers to resources being parts of a collection. In this case, it is possible that these resources share common values in their metadata elements. Although the resources in the collection and their metadata records are distinct, a value set for one metadata element in one resource can propagate itself to other resources of the collection. If the assembly is organized hierarchically, some of the values can be inherited from the ancestor nodes or aggregated from the child nodes. In other cases, the relations connecting the resources may not be such that the metadata value propagates as it is, but the value may be the result of a mathematical or logic expression of metadata of the related resources that either imposes a certain value, or restricts the range of values. Research efforts that use logic (or inference) rules for automatic metadata generation, either explicitly, or implicitly, are included in (Bourda, Doan & Kekhia, 2002; Brase, Painter & Nejdl, 2003; Doan & Bourda, 2005; Motelet, 2005; Margaritopoulos, Manitsaris & Mavridis, 2007) .

Missing letters, misspelled words, inconsistent formatting or representation of the same fields, fields containing inappropriate values according to the standard, are among the problems of this level. A metadata record must strictly follow the rules and guidelines of the standard or the application profile in order to be correct, just like a witness must be able to properly use the language to communicate in order to set his/her testimony fully understandable and, thus, allow the jury to form an opinion on its truthfulness. The second, higher level of correctness requires the semantical rightness of the values of the metadata fields, that is, the true representation of the reality and the absence of any deception. In court terms, this level refers to the truthfulness of the testimony. The first level of correctness concerns objective information, and for the purposes of this paper it is considered to be resolved, for example, by using any relevant validation parser.

The choice of questions addressed to the witnesses is a task performed by the judge.

A metadata record of absolute correctness and full completeness may not be of quality if the (complete and correct) values of the metadata fields do not comply with the context of use. A testimony of a witness in the court, although complete and true, might be irrelevant with the case. This means that the context of a question asked to the witness is incompatible with the context of his/her answer to the question, because of possibly different perspectives. Relevance, as a component of quality, is highly subjective and may be confused with correctness, in the sense that faulty values might be due to either incorrectness, or irrelevance. However, the discriminating factor is the context. An incorrect value is faulty regardless of the context, while an irrelevant value is associated with a particular context. For example, a faulty value for the metadata field \"Date of creation\" of a resource is a matter of incorrectness (either syntactical -wrong format of the real date of creation, or semantical -a syntactically correct date different from the real one) regardless of any possible context. On the other hand, (although correct) values of the metadata field \"Keyword\" of a digital photo may be faulty due to irrelevance regarding a given context. If the digital photo has been indexed in a museum of photography, its keywords might be irrelevant when the photo is used in an image processing course. A way to reduce subjectivity and increase the relevance of the metadata is the use of vocabularies of values. A judge in the court restricts the witness's possible answers with the use of similar vocabularies (\"\u2026please answer with a yes or no\u2026\"). In this logic, a faulty value in a metadata field with a range of values out of a vocabulary will be, more possibly, attributed to incorrectness, rather than irrelevance.",

This definition targets the notion of metadata quality, directly. In a different sense, several of the related studies of metadata quality referenced above Hillman, 2004; Moen, Stewart, & McClure, 1997) try to locate characteristics of metadata indicating quality or to detect deficiencies indicating its absence. Since no researcher claims to have found an exhaustive list of such characteristics, although this list is necessary to have quality, being not sufficient, it cannot guarantee its existence. Conversely, only if quality exists, all of the proposed characteristics are considered to be present. Such characteristics include parameters or dimensions of quality, like \"accuracy\", \"precision\", \"naturalness\", \"informativeness\", etc. Some other characteristics constitute signs and trails implying quality and not indicators assessing quality itself. For example, the parameter \"provenance\" (Bruce & Hillman, 2004) corresponds to the level of reliability and expertise of the metadata record creator. However, although the value of the creator of metadata is a good starting point to assume quality of his/her product, it cannot serve as a proof for quality, for the same reason a testimony of a witness cannot be considered to be true, only because of his/her high social acceptance and respectability. One could say that provenance assesses the probability of having quality in metadata. Other parameters in this category include \"timeliness\", \"currency\", \"conformance to expectations\", \"volatility\", \"authority\".",

Another example of a connection feature is \"Intellectual content\" deriving from the relation \"IsFormatOf\" of Dublin Core, since resources related with this relation have the same content. Apart from relations referring to semantic characteristics of the resources they connect, structural relations (part -whole relations) connecting the related resources are also included in the definition of connection features (\"part\" or \"subset, \"whole\" or \"superset\" connection features).",

Examining the validity of this rule for a learning object by comparing the values of its \"1.3 General.Language\" field against the value, e.g. \"en\", of the same field of a learning object that is part of the first one, can lead to two results: If the rule holds, that is, the value \"en\" is included in the values of the field of the learning object under examination, then there is a clear indication of quality of the two involved fields. If the rule does not hold (the English language is not included in the values of the field of the learning object under examination), there are two cases: a) There is an indication of reduced completeness of the field of the first learning object. b) There is an indication of reduced correctness, either on the first, or on the second learning object (or on both). While in this example, concerning field \"1.3 General.Language\" of LOM, the problem of reduced quality in case b is, clearly, correctness, there might be situations where the faulty values derive from the context, so relevance might be the problematic component of quality.",

If the field under examination is of cardinality greater than 1, then the inequality of its (multiple) value with the value dictated by the rule, implies either completeness or correctness -relevance deficiencies (or both) for the set of the involved fields, depending on the relation between the set of values of this field and the set of values dictated by the rule. For example, a rule of imposition in the LOM standard, dictates that the value of the field \"5.11 Educational.Language\" of a learning object must be equal to the value of a learning object related to the first one with the relation \"IsRequiredBy\", in the sense that if a learning object is required by another one, then the human language used by the typical intended user of this object will be the same with the corresponding language of the object that requires it. Considering several combination of values, we have: If learning object x \"IsRequiredBy\" learning object y and \"5.11\" of x = \"en\", while \"5.11\" of y = \"en\", then the rule holds, and there is a clear indication of quality of the two involved fields. If \"5.11\" of x does not have any value, while \"5.11\" of y = \"en\", then the rule does not hold, and there is indication of reduced completeness. If \"5.11\" of x = \"en\", while \"5.11\" of y = \"en\", \"fr\", then the rule does not hold and there is indication of reduced completeness, as well. If \"5.11\" of x = \"en, \"fr\", while \"5.11\" of y = \"en\", \"it\", then the rule does not hold. This situation might imply either a problem of reduced correctness (\"fr\" has been mistakenly taken for \"it\"), or a problem of both correctness and completeness (\"fr\" has by error been included in the values of \"5.11\" of x, while at the same time \"it\" has been omitted from the set of the values). In the last case, the indicated quality problems do not concern only learning object x, but both related objects as a pair, since the quality of y has not been taken for granted. \u2022 Validity of a rule of restriction: The validity of a rule of restriction, that is, the presence of a value of the metadata field under examination within the restricted range dictated by the rule, is an indication of quality. On the contrary, if the value of this field is outside the dictated range, it is a case of absence of correctness for the involved fields. For example, a rule of restriction in the LOM standard, dictates that the value of the field \"1.8 General.Aggregation level\" of a learning object must be less than the minimum aggregation level of its parts (the learning object is related with its parts with the relation \"IsPartOf\"). If such is the case, then the validity of the rule indicates quality of the involved objects. If the value of \"1.8\" of the learning object is not less than the minimum aggregation level of its parts, then the rule does not hold and there is an indication that the values of the involved fields are not correct. The quality problems located by examining the validity of logic rules provide valuable hints to the administrators of the metadata repository. Although the method cannot locate the problematic component of quality, exactly on a single record or element, it restricts the field of interest and focuses on a reduced set of resources with degraded quality. This is evident, since the conclusions one can draw by examining the validity of the rules concern more than one (related) fields, where no field is considered to be of high quality in advance. In the general case, where no such assumptions deriving from the context of use or the specific application are made, the set of the related fields with problematic quality is the limit of the quality assessment's \"granularity\". However, this method combined with other methods of metadata quality assessment can be of valuable contribution. For example, metrics referenced in Section 3, or manual inspection by experts can be applied to the set of the fields not following a certain rule, in order to pinpoint the problematic ones. This is much more feasible and efficient compared to the usage of these methods over the whole repository.",

Then, metadata quality assessment is performed by assessing these three components.

Examples of these types of studies include a hierarchical taxonomy built from the Deli.cio.us and CiteULike tags by using cosine similarity of tag vectors (Heymann & Garcia-Molina, 2006) , and an ontology generated from Flickr tags using statistical methods (Schmitz, 2006) that in turn was based on Sanderson and Crofts' (1999) model for the cooccurrences of tags. For each frequently co-occurring pair of tags, the model was applied to determine whether or not there was a hierarchical relation between them. Subsequently, a hierarchical structure of tags became an ontology. Rattenbury et al. (2007) presented an approach of identifying event and place tags from Flickr. The assignment of tags' semantic types was learned from patterns of temporal and spatial tag usages employing statistical methods. When contrasted with the three requirements of text relation extraction, it becomes apparent that the second requirement for context is missing from these tag relation extraction experiments.",

Shallow processing involves sentence segmentation, tokenization, part of speech (POS) tagging, and chunking of the text being processed-which is used to identify phrases and chunks (Bunescu & Mooney, 2007) . An example is the study by Roth and Yih (2002) , where shallow parsing was used to segment sentences and to identify entities and relations. Deep processing builds a parsing (or dependency) tree by identifying the shortest-path dependency of language components in sentences. This NLP technique is useful when the context of pairs of entities needs to be processed. In such cases, the words located before, between, and after these entities are used directly as vectors for matching patterns of relations (Agichtein & Gravano, 2000) . The question of whether to use a shallow or deep level of text processing is determined by the design of experiment(s) and algorithm of machine learning. If shallow processing is sufficient, then there is no need to use deep processing (Zelenko et al., 2003) .",

An example is a photo in Flickr that has been assigned four tags: Shangrila (a remote area in southwest China), Mountain, Yunnan (one of the provinces in China), and River, as shown in  FIG. 1 . Since the context is the photo itself and separated from the tags in the search system (i.e., image-based search is still not available in most search systems), the four tags could have a wide variety of contexts for interpretation when separated from the photo they describe. From the perspective of relation extraction, photos do not provide sufficient context for tags and the relations between tags are not explicit. Due to technological limitations, it is difficult to process images in order to acquire semantics. Compounded by the technology limitation is the tagging practice that does not label any relations between the tags, e.g., relation \"Shangrila is located in Yunnan\" is information separate from either the photo or the tags. Acquiring tag relations without context information is analogous to a simple keyword search on the Web-the precision and recall can be very problematic. These predicaments led us to seek external text resources such as search engine results as a solution to obtaining the context of tags. A unique advantage of using tags to extract relations is that the entities are already \"extracted\" by human taggers and so the final error rate can be reduced by avoiding the errors that are propagated by the entity extraction process.",

While the sampling size of tag data and the number of human coded relations could not be as large as we would have liked, this approach appears to be a promising methodology. The introduction of external sources allows for objectively identifying contextual information for context-less tag data and thereby improving the accuracy and reliability of relation extraction. This result also suggests that using external sources for context information can help detect data anomalies in the tag pairs that have a high MI score. We discovered from our experiment that a high MI score did not necessarily mean that Tag X and Tag Y always had direct semantic relations. Some tag pairs did not appear in any sentence in Google search results and no context was found containing the tags. For example, the two tags Tag X = \"all rights reserved\" and Tag Y = \"Canon EOS 350\" had a high MI score, but neither of these two tags appeared together in Google search results; this suggests that no context sentence existed for the two tags. We are unsure at present how the two tags might be related, but it is possible that they are indirectly related. If, for example, they are both related to a third tag in a meaningful way, then they could be related to each other statistically but not semantically. Consequently, the two tags were semantically unrelated and the pair was removed from the tag pair collection to ensure the meaningfulness of tags and their relations.",

Thus if we want to aggregate tagging data from different applications or services, it's very difficult to find out the meanings and correlations between a sets of tags. These limitations are due to the lack of a uniform structure and semantic representation found in tagging systems. In this paper, we will compare existing conceptualisations of tagging activities and folksonomies, to assess their merits and thus contribute to future work in this area. Such a conceptualisation, or ontology, is intended to be used in the representation of tagging data in collaborative tagging systems. This paper begins by discussing the reasons why we need Semantic Web technologies for tagging communities. We then briefly overview existing conceptual models for tagging and propose a novel model for folksonomies. We continue by introducing existing tag ontologies and compare them using our conceptual model. Finally, we discuss the results, draw conclusions, and suggest future research areas.",

Golder and Herbermann (2005) collected del.icio.us data and analysed the structure and usage patterns of tagging systems. Their work discusses the distinction between collaborative tagging and taxonomies -although collaborative tagging systems have many limitations in terms of semantics and structures, it provides the opportunity to learn from one another through sharing and organising information. Marlow (2006) found that for certain users, the number of tags can become stable over time, while for others, it keeps growing. Cattuto et. al (2007) observed small world effects by analyzing a network structure of folksonomies from Bibsonomy (http://www.bibsonomy.org) and del.icio.us. Their work introduced the notions of clustering and characteristic path length to describe the small world effects. According to the study, folksonomies exhibit a small world structure and have a sort of social network. carried out a study to construct community-based semantics based on a tripartite model of actors, concepts, and instances. He emphasises the social context for a representation of ontologies and generates the well-known co-occurrence network of ontology learning as well as a novel semantic network based on community relationships using del.icio.us data.",

Despite noted differences between folksonomies and ontologies (Shirky, 2005; Hendler, 2007) , Semantic Web technologies can be regarded as a complement to folksonomies. As free-text keywords, tags do not have exact meanings and succumb to linguistic ambiguities and variations including the human error factor. While a user may interpret a tag's semantics through using or reading it, computers cannot automatically understand the meaning, since it is not defined in a machine-readable way . Folksonomy systems do not provide a uniform way to share, exchange, and reuse tagging data among users or communities (Kim et al., 2007) . With the use of tagging systems in constant increase, these limitations will become evermore critical. As a potential solution, Specia and Motta (2007) propose the integration of folksonomies and ontologies to enrich tag semantics. In particular, Gruber (2007) and Spivack (2005) emphasise the need for folksonomies and ontologies to work together. In general, tag ontologies can contribute in the following three areas:",

Thus, the folksonomy model has to cover all the collaborative aspects and relationships in addition to the objects associated with tagging activities. A straightforward model for a Folksonomy could be defined as follows: , user group, source, occurrence) ----------------------(3) where the tag set is the set of all tags being employed, the user group is a set of users who participate in the tagging activity and the source is the location where the folksonomy is utilised (e.g. social web sites, online communities). The fourth parameter, occurrence, plays an important role to identify the tags' popularity. Comparing this model to the tagging model (2), we can identify the following similarities: the resources (objects) are not part of the Folksonomy model per se. The Folksonomy is rather applied to the collective tagging process of the resources. The tag and tagger parameters in (2) have been replaced with a collective representation of these entities -tag set and user group. The source is still unique since a folksonomy is a multi-user approach to tagging on a single platform. In our opinion, filtering should not be represented at this level. Alternatively, given we represent multiple tags in this model, the frequencies of individual tags become important. Thus, we include the occurrence as our fifth parameter.",

In particular, we include in our comparison a conceptualisation that we presented in our earlier work -the SCOT Ontology (Kim et al., 2008) . The choice of the conceptualisations was based on how concrete the model is for tagging and use by online communities. Although a lot of work in analyzing folksonomies has been done in social theory and information retrieval, very few tag ontologies have been reported until today. Few 132 researchers have explicitly specified conceptualisations of tagging data (Borwankar, 2005; Story, 2007) in a formal language. Concerning our selection, at the time of this research only 6 of the 7 conceptualisations were actually proposed as ontologies and described in a dedicated representation language (e.g. OWL). Although Gruber's model is just defined conceptually, we include it in our comparison since many research papers have cited his model and some ontologies have been developed based on this model. The selection of ontologies we include in our comparison (plus Gruber's conceptualisation) is shown in Table 1 . Some of the selected conceptualisations better suit the first criterion we have defined at the beginning of this section (a), whereas others are better suited to the second criterion (b). However, all conceptualisations are suitable for both criterions to varying degrees. We will now have a brief look at them individually. Gruber's work is an early attempt to conceptualise tagging activities. His model can be viewed as a first step towards a general applicable representation model for tagging. Although his model itself is not an ontology it clearly reveals a generic conceptualisation of tagging. For more details on his work we refer to Gruber (2007 Gruber ( , 2008 . Newman's model (referred to as Newman) describes relationships between an agent, an arbitrary resource, and one or more tags. In this model there are three core concepts such as Tagger, Tagging, and Tag to represent a tagging activity. Knerr (2006) provides the tagging concept in the Tagging Ontology (referred to as Knerr) and Echarte et. al (2007) propose a model for folksonomies (referred to as Echarte). Since their approaches are based on the ideas of Gruber and Newman, the core elements of the ontologies are almost identical. In particular, Echarte's model extends concepts such as time, domain, visibility, type, etc., and is represented by OWL. The SCOT Ontology -Social semantic Cloud of Tags, describes the structure and semantics of tagging data and enables interoperability of tagging data among heterogeneous social websites and tagging applications. Although SCOT's main goal is to represent collaborative tagging activities, it is also suitable for representing the features of folksonomies (e.g. source, user group, frequencies, tag co-occurrence, etc.). MOAT -Meaning of a Tag, is intended for semantic-annotation of content by providing a meaning for free-text tagging. In addition to extensions to the Tag, Tagging, and Tagger concepts from Newman's ontology, MOAT provides the Meaning class to represent custom, user-provided 'meanings' for tags. The Nepomuk Annotation Ontology (NAO) (Scerri et. al, 2007) is provided for annotating resources on the Social Semantic Desktop (http://www/nepomuk.semanticdesktop.org/). It is not entirely dedicated to tagging practices but demonstrates the increasing importance of tagging representation in social systems. Table 1 , given the criteria discussed at the start of this section. Whereas Newman's Ontology is more inclined towards representing tagging data, and Echarte's Ontology towards representing features of folksnomies, SCOT has a higher level of sophistication in both directions. In the next section, we will detail the main entities and features that the six ontologies and Gruber's model are able to represent. We will support our conclusions in this section by exploring the suitability of the individual conceptualisations, vis-\u00e0-vis criteria (a) and (b) as set out in the start of this section. We start by listing and comparing the concepts (classes) and proceed by listing and comparing their features (attributes).",

                "text": "In this section we discuss in more details the general comparison we presented in the previous section. First, we will have a look whether the individual conceptualisations are suitable for representing general tagging activities and tagging data. All models have a representation for the object, tag and tagger in our Tagging model (5) and all except NAO have a concept representing the tagging process. In Newman's model, the tagging concept is further refined into tags:RestrictedTagging (exactly one tag for a resource) and tags:Tagging (one or more tags for a resource). Echarte et al. provide the Annotation class to represent the tagging activity -i.e., it is the same as tags:Tagging. Thus, the Tagging concept can be considered as a core concept of tag ontologies. Although SCOT and MOAT have different goals compared to others, they also can describe tagging by linking to the tags:Tagging class in Newman's ontology. We now consider whether the ontologies address collective tagging data and provide sufficient features of folksonomies, as described in our Folksonomy model (5). Some ontologies which are based on Gruber's model (which was not designed for folksonomies) have been extended in order to support folksonomies. For instance, Knerr Source class to represent the source. In addition, Knerr allows a user to use foaf:Group alongside foaf:Person to describe the user group. Similarly, NAO allows the user to use nao:Party to represent the user group. MOAT does not have a class for defining it. Nevertheless they are not enough to represent folksonomies at a semantic level. SCOT is consistent with the folksonomy model and provides representations for the source, user group and tag set. In Table 2 we compare the classes provided by these conceptualisations that are relevant to our study. Additionally, we must note that although an ontology might not provide all the required representations, they can act as a \"good Semantic Web citizen\" by connecting to external vocabularies such as SIOC (Semantically-Interlinked Online Community), FOAF (Friend-of-a-Friend), SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organisation System), or DC (Dublin Core Metadata) to further weave data on the Web. For example, MOAT and SCOT use the SIOC ontology extensively to describe online communities, while other ontologies do not reuse or link to external terms. In particular, although Echarte has its own classes to represent a tagging and a folksonomy, the classes do not have any relations with other RDF vocabularies. ",

                "text": "While the number of classes enhances taxonomical representations, the power of ontologies lies in the ability of representing relationships between the classes. Although most of the studied ontologies have a similar taxonomical structure, their attributes vary according to their goals and purposes. We will now have a look at the attributes provided by the ontologies, and compare their functionalities. We differ between data type attributes, which relate classes to non-conceptual data (e.g., string or date), and object type properties which provide relationships between classes. Data Type. Aside from declarative features that represent relationships among users, tags, and resources, a semantic model for folksonomies needs to provide for descriptive features that state non-conceptual values. Most surveyed tag ontologies have many attributes to describe data-type values, i.e. numerical quantities, free-text descriptions, date, time, etc. The data-type properties relevant to this work are summarised in Table 9 . A number of datatype properties are either directly or indirectly (i.e. via subPropertyOf) reused from the Dublin Core vocabulary. For instance Newman's ontology tags:name is a subproperty of dc:title and tags:taggedOn is a subproperty of dc:date. Only SCOT provides for the description of numerical values for entities, e.g. scot:totalTags (attributed to a scot:TagCloud) refers to the total number of tags in a tag cloud and scot:totalItems refers to the total number of resources tagged with tags in the tag cloud. SCOT also provides properties relating to the frequency of a tag itself. Whereas the simplistic scot:ownAFrequency refers to the actual occurrence(s) of a particular tag in a tag cloud, scot:ownRFrequency represents the percentage frequency of a tag within a particular tag cloud, relative to the total of all tag frequencies in that tag cloud. There are many attributes to describe string and literal values for a specific purpose, e.g. tags:name, tagont:prefTagLabel, nao:preLabel, and ec:hasLabel for describing tag's name. Object Type. The object type properties relevant in the context of this study are summarised in Table 4 . SCOT, Echarte and Knerr provide the possibility to define a tagging activity. In SCOT, there is no local property to describe who is involved in a tagging activity. For this purpose SCOT reuses Newman's tags:taggedBy attribute. Via SCOT one can describe who uses tags via the scot:usedBy property. Meanwhile, three ontologies have the property to identify a location or source in which the tagging occurred. TagOnt provides tagont:hasServiceDomain to link the tagging activity to the ServiceDomain, Echarte provides ec:hasSource with the Source as its range value, whereas SCOT provides scot:tagspace with a range of sioc:Site. The relation between tags and resources is defined via tags:isTagOf (range: rdfs:Resource), nao:isTagFor (range: rdfs:Resource), and scot:tagOf (range: sioc:Item) properties in theNewman, NAO and SCOT ontologies respectively. They also provide inverse properties for this relation. Defining relations between tags is one of the benefits of using an ontology to model folksonomies, since this effectively gives semantics to tags in a tag set. Nevertheless only SCOT and Newman take advantage of this possibility. Whereas Neman provides very restricted properties such as tags:equivalentTag and tags:relatedTag, SCOT provides many more attributes such as scot:spellingVariant and scot:delimited. The spelling variant property is further refined into scot:acronym, scot:plural, scot:singular and scot:synonym. In addition, the latter has further subproperties to define specific synonym types, i.e. scot:hypenatated, scot:underscored, scot:slashed, and scot:spaced. In comparison to other ontologies, SCOT specifically provides attributes that represent characteristics of folksonomies such as scot:hasUsergroup, scot:createdBy, scot:contains, and scot:taggingActivity.",

The detailed comparisons presented in Section 4 support several general concluding observations about ontologies related to tagging activities and their usefulness in collaborative tagging systems. This research can be considered as a first attempt to systematically compare different conceptualisations of semantic tagging for collaborative tagging systems. We believe that tag ontologies should be evaluated with respect to a particular goal, application or scenario rather than merely for the sake of an evaluation. Our observations take into consideration two separate criteria -the depth of tagging data per se, and the collaborative aspect in folksonomies. As we mentioned in the start of the paper, tag ontologies are in an early stage and current approaches need to be elaborated or combined to enrich schemas and meet both criteria. Nevertheless the surveyed ontologies already offer an improved opportunity for collaborative tagging systems -especially given the machineprocessable representations that they can provide.",

This continues in the present, but the abuse (\"black SEO\") and misuse (inconsistencies) of <meta> elements forces search engines to ignore this information.

The Semantic Web aims to transform the current Web into a machine-readable Web, while maintaining its ability to be directly and easily read by people. However, metadata in webpages is not personoriented, but search engine-oriented. This metainformation is only available through visualizing source code or using metadata visualization tools (Firefox Dublin Core Viewer extension (2005), or, historically, using special user agents like Metabrowser, which allowed the user to browse both the information and the metainformation within a webpage.",

The Singapore Framework is a model that was released at the 2007 Dublin Core conference approximately a year after our team created the DRIADE application profile, version 1.0 (renamed Dryad application profile, ver.1.0) . Ongoing Dryad metadata work also includes evaluating the effectiveness of our revised application profile and integrating it into a DSpace environment. This report reviews these two metadata focused activities, and highlights recent accomplishments and challenges.",

The application profile is designed to automatically capture as much metadata as possible during publication and data deposition processing. The application profile incorporates elements from the following established metadata schemes: Dublin Core, Darwin Core, Data Documentation Initiative (DDI), Ecological Metadata Language (EML), and PREservation Metadata Implementation Strategies (PREMIS). The Dryad application profile, ver. 1.0, supports Dryad's phase one functionalities that were established in a stakeholders' workshop in December 2006 42 . These functionalities include the capturing, basic preservation, and simple retrieval of datasets and metadata for associated publications. In the future, metadata elements from other metadata schemes will be needed for projected features. Dryad's phased development and corresponding functionalities are summarized in Table 1 . ",

Functional requirements; 2. Domain model; 3. Description Set Profile; 4. Usage guidelines; and 5. Encoding syntax guidelines. With the exception of the optional encoding syntax guidelines, the other four components have been deemed appropriate for the Dryad's application profile revision. The Scholarly Works Application Profile (SWAP) 44 is a key example of an application profile in conformance with the Singapore Framework, and provides a model for the Dryad description. The results of the initial restructuring can be found online as part of the repository project wiki. Addressing the Singapore Framework's first mandatory component, Dryad's functional requirements are based on project system requirement specifications. Using the SWAP example as a model, the Dryad's functional requirements (summarized in Table 1 ) address scope, stakeholders and designated community, requirements gathering, and functional requirements. Dryad's functional requirements include supporting the following operations: 1. resource discovery and use; 2. data interoperability; 3. computer-aided metadata generation and augmentation; 4. linking publications and underlying datasets; 5. data and metadata quality control; and 6. Data security. The designated community for the Dryad application profile includes researchers in the field of evolutionary biology who are generating data and reusing data for their own projects and scientists searching for datasets that are applicable to their own research. Stakeholders are evolutionary biologists, journal publishers in the field of evolutionary biology, professional societies in evolutionary biology, and NESCent. The methodology employed to gather system requirements involved assessing the needs and goals of individuals and groups identified as stakeholders and community members through a workshop held in December 2006 at NESCent in Durham, North Carolina, and more recently an ongoing use case study. Full details about the application profile functional requirements have been added to the Dryad project wiki46.The second mandatory component of the Singapore Framework is the domain model. Unlike the SWAP example, the Dryad application profile is \"data-centric\" rather than document-or publication-centric. Dryad's application profile, ver. 1.0, accommodates a single publication or article with published data from one or more datasets. This relationship is represented in Figure 2 .",

However, in a large digital federation or aggregation, the purpose of the original, deliberately built collections becomes difficult to discern. Collectionlevel metadata has the potential to provide important information about features of a parent collection and why it might be of value to users. But the qualitative aspects of collections are difficult to describe in a systematic way, as they may embody a good deal of intellectual intent and tend to be highly complex and mutable. This paper reports on the current phase of the Digital Collections and Content (DCC) project that is investigating how to represent collection context for scholarly use of large-scale, heterogeneous digital aggregations. The DCC provides integrated access to over 200 digital 49 Defined as: \"consists only of information about the collection as a whole.\" 50 Defined as: \"consists of information about the individual items within [a collection] and their content.\" collections funded by the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), National Leadership Grant program, through a centralized collection registry and metadata repository. The DCC collection metadata schema used for the registry was adapted from a preliminary version of the Dublin Core Collection Description Application Profile (DC CDAP) and the UKOLN RSLP schema . The information used to encode collection registry records is gathered directly from resource developers through a survey, with complementary information taken from collection websites and the descriptive text provided in the grant proposals submitted to IMLS. Once the initial record has been created, it is sent to the local collection administrator for review and editing. Needed updates, changes, and additions of information and links to related collections are made through the DCC collection record edit interface. The DCC project coordinator is responsible for final review and release of all collection records made accessible through the public interface.",

The results presented here are based on a systematic, manual analysis of 202 collection-level records. The free-text in the Description field was both qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed to identify types of information provided about a digital collection and the degree of agreement between information provided in the free-text Description field and relevant information found in other free-text and controlled vocabulary fields. Hereafter, we use the term \"collection properties\" to refer to the types of information identified in the collection records. 53 Table 1 lists the properties found only in the Description field of the DCC collections record. The properties are subdivided into three groups. The first consists of three properties that are special claims about collections: Importance (e.g., \"collection of the most important and influential 19th and early 20th century American cookbooks\"), Uniqueness (e.g., \"unique historical treasures from \u2026 archives, libraries, museums, and other repositories\"), and Comprehensiveness (e.g., \"a comprehensive and integrated collection of sources and resources on the history and topography of London\"). These properties are of particular interest as the kind of 51 Described in detail in our five-year report http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/docs/FinalReport_ResearchMethods.pdf 52 Available at: http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/CDschema_elements.asp 53 No predefined list of categories was used for analysis. The categories emerged from coding performed by two coders who are authors on this paper. A test of intercoder reliability showed 80.4% agreement in assigning the codes to specific cases. self-assessed value commonly used to distinguish special collections. Although not prominent enough to include in the table, a related property, \"Strength\", appeared in three records. 54 The second group contains two other common descriptive properties also not delineated in the DCC collection metadata schema: Creator of items in the collection (e.g., \"The Museum Extension Projects of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Connecticut, Illinois, and Kansas crafted most of the items currently in the collection\") and Provenance (e.g., \"in December 2002, the \u2026 Library acquired the Humphrey Winterton Collection of East African photographs\"). Item Creator 55 and Provenance elements might serve an even greater number of DCC collections than those currently exploiting the Description field for these purposes. There are DCC collections related to single or multiple authors that could benefit from more formal representation of item creators. In this case, a new element would need to be specified, since the existing DC CDAP Collector element is designed to cover creator of the collection not creator of items in the digital collection. Also, a large number of the collections come from museums, and a smaller but substantial group from historical societies and archives. These institutions are likely to have conventions for documenting chain of custody. Here, the DC CDAP Custodial History element is a good model, since it covers the kind of provenance information found in our free-text metadata.",

The research team is exploring how to enhance the current controlled vocabulary with frequently used terms and concepts used in the Description field. This terminology would be more representative of the language used by collection creators to explain the purpose and value of their content and would provide a more accurate record of the materials included in cultural heritage collections. The next step in our study of free-text collection-level metadata is a comparative analysis of collection records from sources other than the DCC, produced by libraries, museums, and archives. A broader understanding of the use of the Description field in various organizational contexts will be particularly meaningful as we continue to explore the general relationship between content and context and the ways in which collection-level description can complement item-level description.",

They are not used in our current implementations. In our approach it takes approximately 4 minutes to establish one mapping between two concepts. Table 1 presents typical unidirectional cross-concordances between two vocabularies A and B. The mappings in the KoMoHe project involve all or major parts of the vocabularies. Vocabularies were analyzed in terms of topical and syntactical overlap before the mapping started. Term lists are precompiled and ready to map when they come to people who are mapping. Collaborative work on one mapping is possible, but more complicated to organize. All mappings are created by researchers or terminology experts. Essential for a successful mapping is an understanding of the meaning and semantics of the terms and the internal relations (structure) of the concerned vocabularies 58 . This includes syntactic checks of word stems but also semantic knowledge to look up synonyms and other related terms. See in this context Lauser et al.

Many cross-concordances are already utilized for search in the German Social Science Information Portal sowiport 59 , which offers bibliographical and other information resources (incl. 15 databases with 10 different vocabularies and about 2.5 million bibliographical references). The application, which uses the equivalence relations 60 , looks up search terms in the controlled vocabulary term list and then automatically adds all equivalent terms from all available vocabularies to the query. If the controlled vocabularies are in different languages, the heterogeneity service also provides a translation from the original term to the preferred controlled term in the other language. If the original query contains a Boolean command, it remains intact after the query expansion (i.e. each query word gets expanded separately). In the results list, a small icon symbolizes the transformation for the user ( see FIG. 2) . Because of performance issues, the cross-concordance query expansion doesn't distinguish between different databases and their preferred controlled vocabulary terms given a concept, but adds all equivalent terms to the query. In principle, this use of the terminology network expands a query with synonyms or quasi-synonyms of the original query terms. By adding terms to the query, recall should increase, that is, more relevant documents will be found. It is unclear, however, whether the indiscriminate expansion of the original query without regard for the terms' appropriateness for a given database can actually decrease the precision of the search. If the created equivalence mappings only denote correct synonyms, then the adding of true synonyms should have no such effect. However, homonymic terms as well as slight variations in the meaning of a concept can have a detrimental impact on the quality and precision of the query. In an ideal case, the searcher could be represented with a selection of terms garnered from the crossconcordances and then select an appropriate formulation. As most users prefer simple search interfaces with quick results (Jansen & Pooch, 2000; Bandos & Resnick, 2004) , an interactive search process or even an appropriate visualization of the cross-concordance work is difficult to accomplish.",

A variant mapping exists when term A from vocabulary 1 is mapped to term B in vocabulary 3, but term A from vocabulary 2 is mapped to term C in vocabulary 3.

Until the 1986, the only concept-toconcept relationship available was an undifferentiated \"See Also\" reference, which was used for both associative (RT) and hierarchical (BT/NT) connections. In that year, in preparation for the first release of the headings in machine readable MARC Authorities form, an attempt was made to automatically convert these \"See Also\" links into the standardized thesaural relations. Unfortunately, the rule used to determine the type of reference to generate relied on the presence of symmetric links to detect associatively related terms; \"See Also\" references that were only present in one of the related terms were assumed to be hierarchical. This left the process vulnerable to inconsistent use of references in the pre-conversion data, with a marked bias towards promoting relationships to hierarchical status. The Library of Congress was aware that the results of the conversion contained many inconsistencies, and intended to validate and correct the results over the course of time. Unfortunately, twenty years later, less than 40% of the converted records have been evaluated. The converted records, being the earliest encountered during the Library's cataloging activities, represent the most basic concepts within LCSH; errors in the syndetic structure for these records affect far more subordinate concepts than those nearer the periphery. Worse, a policy of patterning new headings after pre-existing ones leads to structural errors arising from the conversion process being replicated in these newer headings, perpetuating and exacerbating the errors. As the LCSH prepares for its second great conversion, from MARC to SKOS, it is critical to address these structural problems. As part of the work on converting the headings into SKOS, I have experimented with different visualizations of the tangled web of broader terms embedded in LCSH. This poster illustrates several of these renderings, shows how they can help users to judge which relationships might not be correct, and shows just exactly how Doorbells and Mammals are related.",

Labelle Concordia University, Canada Patrick.Labelle@concordia.ca Keywords: social tagging; social bookmarking; social computing Social tagging empowers users to categorize content in a personally meaningful way while harnessing their potential to contribute to a collaborative construction of knowledge (Vander Wal, 2007) . In addition, social tagging systems offer innovative filtering mechanisms that facilitate resource discovery and browsing . As a result, social tags may support online communication, informal or intended learning as well as the development of online communities. The purpose of this mixed methods study is to examine how undergraduate students participate in social tagging activities in order to learn about their motivations, behaviours and practices. A better understanding of their knowledge, habits and interactions with such systems will help practitioners and developers identify important factors when designing enhancements. In the first phase of the study, students enrolled at a Canadian university completed 103 questionnaires. Quantitative results focusing on general familiarity with social tagging, frequently used Web 2.0 sites, and the purpose for engaging in social tagging activities were compiled. Eight questionnaire respondents participated in follow-up semi-structured interviews that further explored tagging practices by situating questionnaire responses within concrete experiences using popular websites such as YouTube, Facebook, Del.icio.us, and Flickr. Preliminary results of this study echo findings found in the growing literature concerning social tagging from the fields of computer science (Sen et al., 2006) and information science Macgregor & McCulloch, 2006) . Generally, two classes of social taggers emerge: those who focus on tagging for individual purposes, and those who view tagging as a way to share or communicate meaning to others. Heavy del.icio.us users, for example, were often focused on simply organizing their own content, and seemed to be conscientiously maintaining their own personally relevant categorizations while, in many cases, placing little importance on the tags of others. Conversely, users tagging items primarily to share content preferred to use specific terms to optimize retrieval and discovery by others. Our findings should inform practitioners of how interaction design can be tailored for different tagging systems applications, and how these findings are positioned within the current debate surrounding social tagging among the resource discovery community. We also hope to direct future research in the field to place a greater importance on exploring the benefits of tagging as a socially-driven endeavour rather than uniquely as a means of managing information.",

DC-2008 will focus on metadata challenges, solutions, and innovation in initiatives and activities underlying semantic and social applications. Metadata is part of the fabric of social computing, which includes the use of wikis, blogs, and tagging for collaboration and participation. Metadata also underlies the development of semantic applications, and the Semantic Web -the representation and integration of multimedia knowledge structures on the basis of semantic models. These two trends flow together in applications such as Wikipedia, where authors collectively create structured information that can be extracted and used to enhance access to and use of information sources. Recent discussion has focused on how existing bibliographic standards can be expressed as Semantic Web vocabularies to facilitate the ingration of library and cultural heritage data with other types of data. Harnessing the efforts of content providers and end-users to link, tag, edit, and describe their information in interoperable ways (\"participatory metadata\") is a key step towards providing knowledge environments that are scalable, self-correcting, and evolvable. DC-2008 will explore conceptual and practical issues in the development and deployment of semantic and social applications to meet the needs of specific communities of practice. ",

                "text": "The CACAO Project (Cross-language Access to Catalogues and Online Libraries) has been designed to implement natural language processing and cross-language information retrieval techniques to provide cross-language access to information in libraries, a critical issue in the linguistically diverse European Union. This project report addresses two metadata-related challenges for the library community in this context: \"false friends\" (identical words having different meanings in different languages) and term ambiguity. The possible solutions involve enriching the metadata with attributes specifying language or the source authority file, or associating potential search terms to classes in a classification system. The European Library will evaluate an early implementation of this work in late 2008. Keywords: Multilingual issues; interoperability; Knowledge Organization Systems (KOS) (e.g., ontologies, taxonomies, and thesauri); normalization and crosswalks This poster explores the customization of DSpace to allow the use of the AGRIS Application Profile metadata standard and the AGROVOC thesaurus. The objective is the adaptation of DSpace, through the least invasive code changes either in the form of plug-ins or add-ons, to the specific needs of the Agricultural Sciences and Technology community. Metadata standards such as AGRIS AP, and Knowledge Organization Systems such as the AGROVOC thesaurus, provide mechanisms for sharing information in a standardized manner by recommending the use of common semantics and interoperable syntax (Subirats et al., 2007) . AGRIS AP was created to enhance the description, exchange and subsequent retrieval of agricultural Document-like Information Objects (DLIOs). It is a metadata schema which draws from Metadata standards such as Dublin Core (DC), the Australian Government Locator Service Metadata (AGLS) and the Agricultural Metadata Element Set (AgMES) namespaces. It allows sharing of information across dispersed bibliographic systems (FAO, 2005) . AGROVOC 68 is a multilingual structured thesaurus covering agricultural and related domains. Its main role is to standardize the indexing process in order to make searching simpler and more efficient. AGROVOC is developed by FAO (Lauser et al., 2006) . The customization of the DSpace is taking place in several phases. First, the AGRIS AP metadata schema was mapped onto the metadata DSpace model, with several enhancements implemented to support AGRIS AP elements. Next, AGROVOC will be integrated as a controlled vocabulary accessed through a local SKOS or OWL file. Eventually the system will be configurable to access AGROVOC through local files or remotely via webservices. Finally, spell checking and tooltips will be incorporated in the user interface to support metadata editing. Adapting DSpace to support AGRIS AP and annotation using the semantically-rich AGROVOC thesaurus transform DSpace into a powerful, domain-specific system for annotation and exchange of bibliographic metadata in the agricultural domain. (CCT) into a machine-processable format and provide CCT-based Web services, a pilot study has been conducted in which a variety of selected CCT classes and mapped thesaurus entries are encoded with SKOS. OWL and RDFS are also used to encode the same contents for the purposes of feasibility and cost-benefit comparison. CCT is a collected effort led by the National Library of China. It is an integration of the national standards Chinese Library Classification (CLC) 4th edition and Chinese Thesaurus (CT). As a manually created mapping product, CCT provides for each of the classes the corresponding thesaurus terms, and vice versa. The coverage of CCT includes four major clusters: philosophy, social sciences and humanities, natural sciences and technologies, and general works. There are 22 main-classes, 52,992 sub-classes and divisions, 110,837 preferred thesaurus terms, 35,690 entry terms (non-preferred terms), and 59,738 pre-coordinated headings (Chinese Classified Thesaurus, 2005) Major challenges of encoding this large vocabulary comes from its integrated structure. CCT is a result of the combination of two structures (illustrated in Figure 1 ): a thesaurus that uses ISO-2788 standardized structure and a classification scheme that is basically enumerative, but provides some flexibility for several kinds of synthetic mechanisms Chapel Hill hcwhite1@email.unc.edu Keywords: metadata generation; evolutionary biology; personal information management The wide acceptance of social networking tools in online environments is prompting scientists to engage in metadata creation in not only for organizing their own digital records, but also for contributing to data and journal repositories. Understanding the behaviors and practices of these communities can help us create more effective metadata structures within our information systems. This point is underscored by information science researchers who have emphasized the need to examine how certain communities interact with, search for, or organize information (Palmer 2001) . By examining scientists, information professionals can be more informed in how to create better collections, services, and systems. As library and repository collections become more diverse and personalized, the organization and ingest techniques/applications behind those systems also should be based on observations of how actual user communities work. One area that is relevant to the practice of scientists and metadata is personal information management (PIM). The study of personal Information management typically focuses on finding (a relative of retrieval), refinding, maintenance, and organization. Metadata is at the core of these activities, although current research seems to focus more on task completion, rather than the underlying metadata structures and arrangements. Most PIM studies and writings have focused on tool development and finding (Jones 2007) , but have rarely look closely at the organizational/metadata practices of individuals. As scientific communities, like evolutionary biology, turn more to cyberinfrastructures for sharing and collaborating with each other, it is important for information professionals to understand the more personal aspects of metadata generation and organization. Recent studies done by the Dryad repository 69 team have looked at different aspects of data sharing and reuse in the evolutionary biology community. These studies have prompted questions about metadatageneration by scientists, their perceptions of the process, and the link between their metadata and the structures imposed in information systems. This poster will report on a study examining how evolutionary biologists create and use personal metadata to organize their research data. Using an ethnographic interview technique, participants are being interviewed about their current and previous data organization styles and techniques. This information about metadata and information organization can be used to inform new workflow and organization models for knowledge organization and metadata creation practices in developments for repositories, libraries, and cyberinfrastructures. Keywords: repository ecology; repository interaction; services; metadata interoperability; management; communication; research dissemination Developing and managing local practices about metadata implementation (desired quality, workflow, support tools, guidelines, and vocabularies) and about metadata exposure (supported standards, and pre-exposure transformations) requires an ability to understand and communicate the specific complex settings in which the metadata, resources, and users exist. Developing such an understanding is often informed by an implicit or explicit conceptual model. Ecology is the study of complex natural systems, with the aim of understanding and modeling the processes and interactions between the participants in the system and their environment. The concept is also widely used as a metaphor to describe complex systems within their settings. The Repositories Research Team (which supports repository development work in UK HE) has been examining the use of ecology as a metaphor to support the understanding and representation of interactions between repositories, dependent services, and their users. These interactions whether technical, political, or cultural have a direct impact on the metadata in each repository. Where many other approaches to modeling facilitate an abstract view of a single type of interaction; the ecologically influenced approach seeks to support communication of the combined influences of a repository's technical and cultural setting, however specific and chaotic (or messy) it may be. The idea that ecology is a suitable metaphor for the interaction of users and technologies has been considered by Davenport (1997) , by Nardi and O'Day (2000) , in strand of projects funded by the European Union (see Nachira et al., 2007) , and by Robertson et al. (2008) . This poster presents an ecologically influenced view of a researcher seeking to disseminate and store their presentations. The interactions and resources that will be considered, as they influence the metadata, include the storage of the presentation in formal and informal services (a repository, SlideShare), different versions of the intellectual content (blog post, slides, paper), different formats (PowerPoint, PDF). Environmental factors, which affect the metadata, that will be considered include influences on the researcher (e.g. availability of web 2.0 tools, the link between career progression and publication of research, a commitment to sharing resources, and institutional policies) and influences on the institutional policies (such as IPR concerns about the use of third party material or the loss of university ownership of intellectual outputs or branding).",

                "text": "Joachim Wackerow GESIS Mannheim, Germany joachim.wackerow@gesis.org Keywords: Data Document Initiative, DDI, metadata, datasets The Data Documentation Initiative (DDI) 70 is an international effort to establish an XML-based standard for the compilation, presentation, and exchange of documentation for datasets in the social and behavioral sciences. The most recent version 3.0 of the DDI supports a rich and structured set of metadata elements that not only fully informs a potential data analyst about a given dataset but also facilitates computer processing of the data. 71 Moreover, data producers will find that by adopting the DDI standard they can produce better and more complete documentation as a natural step in designing and fielding computer-assisted interviewing. DDI 3.0 embraces the full life cycle of the data from conception, through development of the data collection instrument, collection and cleaning of data, production of data products, distribution, preservation, and reuse or analysis of the data. DDI 3.0 is designed to facilitate sharing schemes for concepts, questions, coding, and variables within organizations or throughout the social science research community. Comparison through direct inheritance as in the case of comparisonby-design or through the mapping of items like variables or categories allow capture of the harmonization processes used in creating integrated files in an uniform and machine-actionable way. DDI 3.0 is providing the structural support needed to facilitate comparative survey work in a way that was previously unavailable in an open, non-proprietary system. A specific DDI module allows for the capture and expression of native Dublin Core elements (DCMES), used either as references or as descriptions of a particular set of metadata. This module uses the simple Dublin Core namespace represented as XML Schema following the guidelines for implementing Dublin Core in XML. In DDI, the Dublin Core is not used as the primary citation mechanism -this module is included to support applications which understand the Dublin Core XML, but which do not understand DDI. This module is used wherever citations are permitted within DDI 3.0 (like citations of a study description or of other material). DDI 3.0 is aligned with other metadata standards as well: with SDMX (time-series data) for exchanging aggregate data, with ISO/IEC 11179 (metadata registry) for building data registries such as question, variable, and concept banks, and with FGDC and ISO 19115 (geographic standards) for supporting GIS users. DDI 3.0 is described in a conceptual model which is also expressed in the Universal Modeling Language (UML). Modular XML Schemas are derived from the conceptual model. Many elements support computer processing -that is, it will go beyond being \"human readable\", and move toward the goal of being \"machine-actionable\". The final release of DDI 3.0 has been published on April 28 th 2008. The standard was developed by the DDI Alliance, an international group encompassing data archives and research institutions from several countries in Western Europe and North America. Earlier versions of DDI provide examples of institutions and applications: the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) Data Catalog, the Council of European Social Science Data Services (CESSDA) Data Portal, the Dataverse Network, the International Household Survey Network (IHSN), NESSTAR Software for publishing data on the Web and online analysis, and the Microdata Management Toolkit (by the World Bank Data Group for IHSN). Keywords: application profile; scholarly works; OpenURL A large number of scholarly works is self-archived at the university's Open Access repositories. Researchers can search these materials using general web search engines such as Google, as well as with OAI-PMH-based search engines such as OAIster (http://www.oaister.org/). The archives can also be accessed using federated search services such as MetaLib by setting the repositories as a search target. However, it remains difficult for researchers to access materials in these repositories using standard academic databases such as Thomson Reuters' Web of Science. The National Institute of Informatics (NII) in Japan has developed a DC application profile called junii2 (http://ju.nii.ac.jp/oai/junii2.xsd) for scholarly works. The AIRway Project (Access path to Institutional Resources via link resolvers) has used this profile to develop a new way of connecting university repositories with academic databases via link resolvers. junii2 is designed as an OpenURL-compliant schema (info:ofi/fmt:xml:xsd:journal), and has now been widely adopted by more than 70 university repositories in Japan. A particular feature is its ability to describe variant self-archived materials with a version description function (specifying whether it is an author's draft or the final published version) and information on the availability of the full text in the repository. AIRway is an internet server that harvests metadata from university repositories. After harvesting metadata, AIRway separates the metadata of materials whose full texts are available in the repositories from others. A link resolver sends an OpenURL request to the AIRway server before creating its navigation window. If metadata of the requested material are found in the AIRway server and the material's full text is available in a repository, the AIRway server provides the xml for the metadata of the material to the link resolver. Rather than being a new service system for end users, it is a back-end knowledgebase for existing link resolvers. 1CATE (OCLC's link resolver) and some installations of SFX (Ex Libris' link resolver) now use AIRway as one of their knowledgebases. In this way, junii2 and AIRway make Open Access scholarly works in university repositories accessible through general academic databases. This will be particularly effective if, for example, someone without a license to access an electronic journal finds a research paper on the journal in the search results of an academic database. The AIRway Project is funded by the NII Institutional Repositories Program (http://www.nii.ac.jp/irp/en/).",

Since free text is insufficient for expressing such references precisely and unambiguously, many social computing platforms coin identifiers for topics, places, events, and people and provide interfaces for finding and selecting these identifiers from controlled lists. Using these interfaces, users collaboratively construct a web of links among entities. This model needn't be limited to social networking sites. Understanding an item in a digital library or museum requires context: information about the topics, places, events, and people to which the item is related. Students, journalists and investigators traditionally discover this kind of context by asking \"the four Ws\": what, where, when and who. The DCMI Kernel Metadata Community has recognized the four Ws as fundamental elements of descriptions (Kunze & Turner, 2007) . Making better use of metadata to answer these questions via links to appropriate contextual resources has been our focus in a series of research projects over the past few years.",

                "text": "Currently we are building a system for enabling readers of any text to relate any topic, place, event or person mentioned in the text to the best explanatory resources available. This system is being developed with two different corpora: a diverse variety of biographical texts characterized by very rich and dense mentions of people, events, places and activities, and a large collection of newly-scanned books, journals and manuscripts relating to Irish culture and history. Like a social computing platform, our system consists of tools for referring to topics, places, events or people, disambiguating these references by linking them to unique identifiers, and using the disambiguated references to provide useful information in context and to link to related resources. Yet current social computing platforms, while usually amenable to importing and exporting data, tend to mint proprietary identifiers and expect links to be traversed using their own interfaces. We take a different approach, using identifiers from both established and emerging naming authorities, representing relationships using standardized metadata vocabularies, and publishing those representations using standard protocols so that links can be stored and traversed anywhere. Central to our strategy is to move from appearances in a text to naming authorities to the the construction of links for searching or querying trusted resources. Using identifiers from naming authorities, rather than literal values (as in the DCMI Kernel) or keys from a proprietary database, makes it more likely that links constructed using our system will continue to be useful in the future. WorldCat Identities URIs (http://worldcat.org/identities/) linked to Library of Congress and Deutsche Nationalbibliothek authority files for persons and organizations and Geonames (http://geonames.org/) URIs for places are stable identifiers attached to a wealth of useful metadata. Yet no naming authority can be totally comprehensive, so our system can be extended to use new sources of identifiers as needed. For example, we are experimenting with using Freebase (http://freebase.com/) URIs to identify historical events, for which no established naming authority currently exists. Keywords: metadata, shared semantics, Web 2.0, collaborative learning The basic goal of education within a discipline is to transform a novice into an expert. This entails moving the novice toward the \"semantic space\" that the expert inhabits-the space of concepts, meanings, vocabularies, and other intellectual constructs that comprise the discipline. Metadata is significant to this goal in digitally mediated education environments. Encoding the experts' semantic space not only enables the sharing of semantics among discipline scientists, but also creates an environment that bridges the semantic gap between the common vocabulary of the novice and the granular descriptive language of the seasoned scientist (Greenberg, et al, 2005) . Developments underlying the Semantic Web, where vocabularies are formalized in the Web Ontology Language (OWL), and Web 2.0 approaches of user-generated folksonomies provide an infrastructure for linking vocabulary systems and promoting group learning via metadata literacy. Group learning is a pedagogical approach to teaching that harnesses the phenomenon of \"collective intelligence\" to increase learning by means of collaboration. Learning a new semantic system can be daunting for a novice, and yet it is integral to advance one's knowledge in a discipline and retain interest. These ideas are key to the \"BOT 2.0: Botany through Web 2.0, the Memex and Social Learning\" project (Bot 2.0). 72 Bot 2.0 is a collaboration involving the North Carolina Botanical Garden, the UNC SILS Metadata Research center, and the Renaissance Computing Institute (RENCI). Bot 2.0 presents a curriculum utilizing a memex as a way for students to link and share digital information, working asynchronously in an environment beyond the traditional classroom. Our conception of a memex is not a centralized black box but rather a flexible, distributed framework that uses the most salient and easiest-to-use collaborative platforms (e.g., Facebook, Flickr, wiki and blog technology) for personal information management. By meeting students \"where they live\" digitally, we hope to attract students to the study of botanical science. A key aspect is to teach students scientific terminology and about the value of metadata, an inherent function in several of the technologies and in the instructional approach we are utilizing. This poster will report on a study examining the value of both folksonomies and taxonomies for post-secondary college students learning plant identification. Our data is drawn from a curriculum involving a virtual independent learning portion and a \"BotCamp\" weekend at UNC, where students work with digital plant specimens that they have captured. Results provide some",

These value-added elements include those typically found in commercial and social networking sites, such as book jacket images, reviews, and usergenerated tags. One such site that libraries are exploring as a model is LibraryThing (www.librarything.com) LibraryThing is a social networking site that allows users to \"catalog\" their own book collections. Members can add tags and reviews to records for books, as well as engage in online discussions. In addition to its service for individuals, LibraryThing offers a feebased service to libraries, where institutions can add LibraryThing tags, recommendations, and other features to their online catalog records. This poster will present data analyzing the quality and quantity of the metadata that a large academic library would expect to gain if utilizing such a service, focusing on the overlap between titles found in the library's catalog and in LibraryThing's database, and on a comparison between the controlled subject headings in the former and the user-generated tags in the latter. During February through , a random sample of 383 titles from the University of Minnesota Libraries catalog was searched in LibraryThing. Eighty works, or 21 percent of the sample, had corresponding records available in LibraryThing. outline the advantages and disadvantages of using controlled vocabulary for subject access to information resources versus the growing trend of tags supplied by users or by content creators. Using the 80 matched records from the sample, comparisons were made between the user-supplied tags in LibraryThing (social tags) and the subject headings in the library catalog records (controlled vocabulary system). In the library records, terms from all 6XX MARC fields were used. To make a more meaningful comparison, controlled subject terms were broken down into facets according to their headings and subheadings, and each unique facet counted separately. A total of 227 subject terms were applied to the 80 catalog records, an average of 2.84 per record. In LibraryThing, 698 tags were applied to the same 80 titles, an average of 8.73 per title. The poster will further explore the relationships between the terms applied in each source, and identify where overlaps and complementary levels of access occur.",

We are working together across four universities with colleagues engaged in managing open access repositories for e-prints. Our project supports 'early adopter' academics who wish to openly share datasets and presents a model for depositing 'orphaned datasets' that are not being deposited in subject-domain data archives/centres. Outputs from the project are intended to help to demystify data as complex objects in repositories, and assist other institutional repository managers in overcoming barriers to incorporating research data. By building on lessons learned from recent JISC-funded data repository projects such as SToRe 74 and GRADE 75 the project will help realize the vision of the Digital Repositories Roadmap, e.g. the milestone under Data, \"Institutions need to invest in research data repositories\" (Heery and Powell, 2006) . Application of appropriate metadata is an important area of development for the project. Datasets are not different from other digital materials in that they need to be described, not just for discovery but also for preservation and re-use. The GRADE project found that for geo-spatial datasets, Dublin Core metadata (with geo-spatial enhancements such as a bounding box for the 'coverage' property) was sufficient for discovery within a DSpace repository, though more indepth metadata or documentation was required for re-use after downloading. The project partners are examining other metadata schemas such as the Data Documentation Initiative (DDI) versions 2 and 3, used primarily by social science data archives (Martinez, 2008) . Crosswalks from the DDI to qualified Dublin Core are important for describing research datasets at the study level (as opposed to the variable level which is largely out of scope for this project). DataShare is benefiting from work of of the DRIADE project (application profile development for evolutionary biology) , eBank UK 76 (developed an application profile for crystallography data) and GAP 77 (Geospatial Application Profile, in progress) in defining interoperable Dublin Core qualified metadata elements and their application to datasets for each partner repository. The solution devised at Edinburgh for DSpace will be covered in the poster. ",

REST perspective, identifying resources is closely interrelated to the conception of a service architecture that answers an agent's questions about those resources. It should not be a prerequisite to already have a clear conception about the versioning conventions of DDC concepts. If we redefine editions as being nothing more than named time slices, opaque version labels assigned to a group of resources at a specific point in time, the hierarchical {edition_type}/{edition_version}, e.g., edn/22, abr/14, should be represented together in a more generic way as {edition_stamp} with a larger value set (\"e22\" for the full edition 22, \"a14\" for the abridged edition 14, \"qr-3-2007\" for the third quarterly release in 2007 of the Dewey database, or \"[2007, 05, 25]\" for a specific point in time that would be mapped to the most appropriate version by the service). 65 Evolving the \"edition_type\" aspect to a timestamp aspect is useful on another level.
