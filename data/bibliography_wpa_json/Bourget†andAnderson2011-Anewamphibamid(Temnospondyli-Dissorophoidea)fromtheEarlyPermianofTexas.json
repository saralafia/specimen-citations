    "abstract": "The Amphibamidae are undergoing intensive investigation at present, with many new species recently described to better understand their interrelationships and role in the origin of extant amphibians. A new genus and species of amphibamid, Rubeostratilia texensis, represented by a skull from the Early Permian of Texas, shows many similarities with a recent described species from Richards Spur, Oklahoma, Pasawioops mayi. The skull is elongate and oval, with enlarged external naris and orbits, typical of the other amphibamids within the Micropholis-Tersomius cluster. The skull exhibits the laterally exposed palatine (LEP) and the dorsal quadrate process typical of the Dissorophoidea. Unlike Pasawioops, the new species preserves only a few additional characters relevant to amphibamid relationships: the pterygoid contacts only the ectopterygoid, the postfrontal's shape is falciform, and the alary processes do not extend further posteriorly than one-half of the length of the external naris. We included Rubeostratilia in a recently published amphibamid matrix, to which we added four characters, and conducted two separate phylogenetic analyses, differing in the coding of three characters in the genus Plemmyradytes. The results demonstrate the importance of precision in coding for each character, because these minor changes lead to two different topologies. A brief morphometric analysis of amphibamid cranial anatomy was conducted to better understand the nature of the different morphotypes among which the new species clusters. The results of both morphometric and phylogenetic analysis add support to the emerging consensus that amphibamids cluster into two distinct clades.",

Presumably these are related to the nasolacrimal canal, the passage of branches of the trigeminal nerve, and associated vasculature; however, one of the ventral-most foramina appears to hook right and be exit through a foramen on the lateral wall of the lacrimal. Unfortunately, computed tomographic (CT) scans were unsuccessful in imaging this area of the skull and directly observe the passage of these canals because of the radio opacity of the matrix. Doleserpeton was also described as having '3 to 5' foramina on the anterior orbital wall of the lacrimal (Bolt, 1968) .

The palatine process is in contact with the ectopterygoid rostrally and is covered with a shagreen of denticles. It is slightly displaced from its natural position of articulation, but this is deemed to be exclusively on the ectopterygoid for a number of reasons. First, the anterior-most tip of the pterygoid is complete and finished with smooth bone, and did not extend further. Second, there is no evidence for an articulation facet along the medial surface of the palatine. Third, the upward force applied by the pterygoid on the posterior ectopterygoid could have produced the transverse crack, which runs posterior to the slightly more oblique suture between the ectopterygoid and palatine. The basipterygoid ramus, comprised of a rostral and posterior lamina forming a dorsally oriented chevron, forms a loose basicranial articulation with the parasphenoid, which fits into the ventral space of basipterygoid articulation with a laterally directed peg.

Additional bones are present on the right occipital surface (Fig. 1 ). One has a narrow, but thick, base near the lower margin of the foramen magnum, and thins as it fans out dorsolaterally to articulate with the skull roof near the suture between the tabular and postparietal. It is difficult to determine, but it appears to underlap the tabular at least at this point. This is interpreted as being the paroccipital process of the opisthotic. Near the base of the paroccipital process, rotated out of position to the right of its natural position, is a portion of what is probably the opisthotic. On its dorsorostral surface the posterior margin of the fenestra ovalis can be seen. Extending dorsomedially from this point, below the base of the paroccipital process, is a portion of the exoccipital, which would have formed the lateral margin of the foramen magnum, although no sutures are visible to distinguish between it and the opisthotic. Near the stem of the paroccipital process, a small foramen can be seen on the occipital ramus of the postparietal. Based on location, this could be the jugular foramen; however, it is smaller in size than that in amphibamids, so it could be a nutrient foramen. If it is the jugular foramen, it implies that the occipital ramus of the postparietal has fused with the exoccipital, of which no trace can be seen in the specimen.",

Similar, although relatively shorter, elements have also been described in Pasawiops (Fr\u00f6bisch and Reisz, 2008) in the same location as we describe for Rubeostratilia.

To correct for bone breakage and displacement, each bone (or partial bone) was drawn individually and the skull was thus reassembled using a light box. For instance, the right vomer is very well preserved whereas we can see just one-third of the left. A very little piece of the two vomers at the bottom was broken off by the cultriform process of the parasphenoid at the moment of the crushing (Fig. 3) .

Landmarks, no more than 11 (number of species + 1) in order to not add uncertainty (Bookstein, 1991) , were digitized using Tps-Dig (Rohlf, 2008a) . Landmarks were selected on clearly identifiable points, such as suture junctions. Because our morphometric analysis is limited in the numbers of landmarks that can be used, different combinations of landmarks and baselines were used to analyze specific regions of the skull. Analysis was conducted with two different programs: different baselines were tested with Co-ordGen6h (Sheets, 2000; Fig. 6 ), and principal component analysis (PCA) and canonical variates were carried out using Morpho J (Klingenberg, 2008) .",

Then follow, in order from crown to stem, Platyrhinops, Eoscopus, and then a clade of Plemmyradytes and Georgenthalia. This seven-species clade is weakly supported; the bootstrap value is only 54%, and the clade is supported only by character 49:2. Note that no character groups Plemmyradytes and Georgenthalia other than reversions in characters 26 and 28. Subsequently the following clade is found (taxa in order from tip to root): Rubeostratilia, Pasawioops, Tersomius, and Micropholis most basally. The monophyly of Amphibamidae is very well supported with a bootstrap value of 97%, well supported by characters 14, 33:1, 34:2, 38, and 42. The clade of Dissorophoidea without Micromelerpeton is supported by characters 2, 20, 34:1, and 47, with a bootstrap value of 53%. The monophyly of Dissorophoidea is well supported with a bootstrap value of 99% and characters 1, 39:1, and 58. Note that the clade of Dissorophidae is well supported by bootstrap analysis (100%) and by characters 4, 39:2, and 46.",

As usual, bootstrap values for this phylogeny are on the low side, but with good support for Dissorophoidea (99%), Dissorophidae (100%), Amphibamidae (97%), and the terminal trichotomy of Amphibamus, Gerobatrachus, and Doleserpeton (61%). The other main change is that Dissorophidae is not sister group to Amphibamidae anymore. We found them now closer to Ecolsonia and then Trematopidae within a monophyletic Olsoniformes (Anderson et al., 2008a) . This changes the interpretation of the evolution of some characters. Characters that previously supported the idea of grouping Dissorophidae and Amphibamidae together such as number 11, 12, and 15 appear twice. The number of total convergence increases in this topology, with 22 convergences (against 14 previously).

Following Schoch (2002) , who was working on the ontogenetic evolution in temnospondyls, in particular Platyrhinops, there seems to have been no change in the suture between pterygoid-palatine; there was no suture in either the juvenile or adult of Platyrhinops.

This result agrees with Anderson et al.'s (2008a Anderson et al.'s ( , 2008b analyses. Among Olsoniformes, our results show Dissorophidae and Trematopidae as sister groups, as also found in some recent articles (Huttenlocker et al., 2007; Anderson et al., 2008a Anderson et al., , 2008b . With our modification to the coding of Plemmyradytes (Fig. 9A ), Dissorophoidea assumes a pectinate shape, with Micromelerpeton in the most basal position, followed by Ecolsonia, Trematopidae, and then Dissorophidae as sister group to Amphibamidae.

Unfortunately, the large amount of missing data in the matrix creates some instability, and new characters did not resolve the relationships.

Smaller-scale anatomical features, such as the palpebral complex or the construction of the otic notch, may provide additional characters. The idea that the two clades of amphibamids are adapted to different ecologies could be tested by studying the postcranial skeleton; differences in locomotion should be reflected in different construction of the vertebrae, the placement of muscular insertions, and the bone microstructure. Finally, more thorough knowledge of amphibamid phylogeny should help better understand instances of miniaturization or paedomorphosis, important evolutionary factors that can potentially confound phylogenetic relationships.
