    "abstract": "South Texas has a rich late Cenozoic fossil record. At least 18 extinct genera and 27 extinct species of fossil mammals are known from the late Pleistocene alone. Many of these were participants in a major evolutionary event known as the Great American Biotic Interchange, which resulted from the formation of the Panamanian land bridge between North and South America. South American genera that traveled north and are present in the late Pleistocene of South Texas are the giant ground sloths Eremotherium, Paramylodon, and Megalonyx, the large relatives of armadillos Holmesina and Glyptotherium, and the capybara Neochoerus. North American genera that traveled south include the wolf Canis the bears Tremarctos and Arctodus, the saber cat Smilodon, the gomphothere elephant Cuvieronius, the tapir Tapirus, the horse Equus, the peccary Platygonus, and the llamas Palaeolama and Hemiauchenia. The 6.5 ft (2 m) tall, flightless, predatory, 'terror bird' Titanis is another South American immigrant. It had previously been thought that it entered North America about 2 Ma and survived in South Texas until the end of the Pleistocene. However, rare earth element dating of the South Texas Titanis shows that it arrived in North America in the early Pliocene (about 5 Ma), shortly before the completion of the Panamanian land bridge.",

                "text": "The Great American Biotic Interchange (GABI) was a major event in late Cenozoic biogeography as taxa from North and South America moved across the land bridge that formed with the emergence of the Isthmus of Panama (Simpson, 1950 (Simpson, , 1980 Patterson and Pascual, 1968; Webb, 1976 Webb, , 1985 Morgan, 2002 Morgan, , 2005 . Situated on the coastal plain of the western Gulf of Mexico, South Texas ( Fig. 1 ) was on the main highway of animals that migrated between the Americas. In the late Miocene and early Pliocene, 7 to 5 million years ago (Ma), before the land bridge was completed, a few land animals crossed the narrowed Panamanian seaway. These included two genera of giant ground sloths that traveled north and an extinct member of the raccoon family that traveled south. These have been termed \"heralds\" of the interchange (Webb, 1976) . A notable addition to the herald taxa is the giant carnivorous 'terror bird' Titanis (MacFadden et al., 2007) . During the late Pliocene and early Pleistocene, following completion of the Panamanian land bridge, representatives of 17 families of mammals migrated south and 10 migrated north (Webb, 2006) . Many of these migrants have representatives in the late Pleistocene South Texas fossil record, which includes at least 18 extinct genera and 27 extinct species of Pleistocene mammals (Table 1 ). (Lundelius, 1972) ; 3 = Aransas River (Hay, 1926) ; 4 = Bee County (Sellards, 1940) .",

                "text": "In natural history publications from the late 19th to mid 20th centuries, South Texas was usually referred to as \"Southwestern Texas.\" Perhaps the earliest description of a fossil from South Texas was by E. D. Cope, the foremost herpetologist and vertebrate paleontologist of his day. Cope (1880) noted the back end of a Smilodon (Pleistocene saber-toothed cat) skull collected from southwestern Texas by Gabriel Marnock, a pioneering Texas herpetologist who homesteaded near San Antonio (Stecker, 1933) . In the late 1800s, Dr. William Taylor of San Diego, Texas, \"a graduate of Edinburgh [Scotland] , and a scholarly gentleman\" (Bourke, 1894) , made collections of Recent and fossil vertebrates that he sent to specialists for identification. Cope (1885, 1891) described much of this material, including the vertebrate fossils. Cope (1889) listed a mammoth, glyptodont, canid, and turtle and five species of horses from the \"Equus beds\" of southwestern Texas in what was then part of Nueces County. Gidley (1901) named a new species of horse Equus giganteus for the largest tooth in the collection. Dumble (1903) gave the locality as Taranchua Creek, a branch of San Diego Creek, near San Diego, Duval County, approximately 50 mi west of Corpus Christi. Sellards (1940) cited documentation justifying this locality assignment. Additional specimens of Equus from the San Diego area are in the collections of the Texas Memorial Museum (TMM). Dumble (1903) reported on scattered mammal fossils from the Goliad Formation (Wilson, 1956) . More extensive collections were made in Bee and Goliad counties by Works Progress Administration (WPA) crews of the Bureau of Economic Geology in the 1930s. Although it was initially assigned to the Pliocene, the now wellknown mammalian fossils of the Goliad indicate a late Miocene age, about 11 Ma (Tedford et al., 1987) . Hay (1926) described a collection of 13 species of Pleistocene mammals made by Dr. Mark Francis, the first veterinarian at Texas A&M University, from the banks of the Aransas River, west of Sinton, San Patricio County. The late Pleistocene Berclair terrace of Blanco and Medio creeks, approximately 60 mi north northwest of Corpus Christi, in Bee and Goliad counties, has produced an assemblage of at least 18 species of mammals (Sellards, 1940; Quinn, 1957; Conkin and Conkin, 1962) . By far the most important Pleistocene fossil locality in South Texas has been the Ingleside local fauna in San Patricio County on the north side of Corpus Christi Bay. The fossils were collected by WPA from 1939 -1941 . Lundelius (1972 described 31 species of fossil mammals from Ingleside. Otvos and Howat (1996) determined that the pond containing the Ingleside fauna was mid to late Wisconsinan in age, postdating the Ingleside sands.",

Sand and gravel quarries from the valley fill and the youngest terrace have produced a reworked early Pliocene and an in-place late Pleistocene fauna (Baskin, 1991; Baskin and Mosqueda, 2002) . Conkin et al. (1962) were the first to briefly note the occurrence of vertebrate fossils from one of these localities. The Wright Materials, Inc. quarries (TMM localities 43059 and 43064) are approximately 3 mi north of Bluntzer, Texas. A log from the valley fill which contains the in-place Pleistocene fauna has been dated at 13,230 \u00b1 110 BP (Baskin, 1991) . Durbin et al. (1997) used thermoluminescence to date these deposits at 30-35,000 BP. Although few of the Wright quarry fossils are as complete as those from Ingleside, what is lacking in quality, they more than make up in quantity. For example, at Ingleside two mammoth mandibles and 12 isolated molars are present. McDaniel and Jefferson (2006) report on an older collection of 149 mammoth molars, which they mistakenly attribute to a gravel quarry near Mathis, San Patricio County, Texas. Over 170 complete horse metapodials and 29 radii are known from the Wright quarries compared to no horse metapodials and three horse radii from Ingleside.",

Until then marsupials, filled the canid and felid niches, even including a saber-cat-like marsupial. Tremarctine bears appeared in North America 7 Ma.

The short-faced bears Arctodus, from the late Pliocene and Pleistocene of North America, and Arctotherium, from the Pleistocene of South America, have been considered congeneric. In any event, Arctodus is ancestral to Arctotherium. The long-limbed Arctodus was the largest carnivore in the North American Pleistocene.

Lions entered North America from Eurasia in the late Pleistocene. The American lion, which is known from Alaska to Peru, was about 25% larger than the African lion Panthera leo. It is sometimes considered a subspecies, Panthera leo atrox. Although Pleistocene jaguars (Panthera onca) are known from Central Texas to California to Missouri to Florida in the late Pleistocene, none have been recovered yet from South Texas.

These horses are reworked from older deposits, presumed to be the upper Goliad Formation. The nearest exposures of the Goliad are approximately 10 km upriver from the sand and gravel pits near Bluntzer, Texas and 25 km from a gravel pit near Odem. Late Hemphillian horses from the gravel pits are Dinohippus mexicanus, Astrohippus stockii, Nannippus cf. beckensis, Nannippus aztecus, Pseudhipparion simpsoni, and Neohipparion eurystyle. Other evidence of an early Pliocene age for the reworked specimens are rhinoceros tooth fragments and parts of an edentulous Rhyncotherium mandible and palate. Rhynchotherium is a four-tusked gomphothere known from the late Clarendonian (late Miocene) through the late Blancan (late Pliocene).

Titanis from Texas is known from a single proximal phalanx from the gravel pit near Odem. Baskin (1995) considered that it might be late Pleistocene in age, since there is no evidence of two million year old mammals in the Nueces River fauna and five million years is well before the main pulse of faunal interchange between the Americas. However, rare earth element dating shows that the Texas Titanis is the same age as the latest Hemphillian horses (MacFadden and others, 2007) .
