    "abstract": "Recent work in the Campanian Aguja Formation of Big Bend, Texas, has resulted in the recovery of two frontoparietal domes from a new genus of pachycephalosaur. Texacephale langstoni gen. et sp. nov. is diagnosed by a tall, arched nasal boss, flange-like processes articulating the dome with the peripheral elements, and a low pedicel separating the cerebral fossa from the skull roof. The skull dome is composed largely of the fused frontals and parietals, with limited participation of the peripheral elements, and the supratemporal fenestrae remain open. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that Texacephale langstoni is a basal member of the Pachycephalosauria. The discovery of Texacephale supports previous suggestions that the dinosaur fauna of Texas was distinct from that of contemporary assemblages to the north. The phylogenetic analysis presented here indicates that the Asian pachycephalosaurs form a monophyletic group, deeply nested within the Pachycephalosauridae, and that the basal members of the group are all North American. This finding indicates that pachycephalosaurids originated in North America, rather than Asia, as previously believed. The high diversity of North American pachycephalosaurs and the late appearance of pachycephalosaurs in Asia are consistent with this hypothesis. The biology of Texacephale and other Pachycephalosauridae are also discussed. The morphology of the dome in Texacephale and other pachycephalosaurs supports the hypothesis that pachycephalosaurids engaged in intraspecific combat, while the occurrence of Texacephale and other pachycephalosaurs in nearshore deposits argues that the pachycephalosaurs were not restricted to inland habitats.",

Although the region has been studied for many years, vertebrate fossils from these beds tend to be rare and poorly preserved, and as a result, comparatively little is known about the dinosaur fauna of the region. Pachycephalosaurs, a group of ornithischian dinosaurs characterized by a massive, domed skull roof (Marya\u00f1 ska et al., 2004) , have been among the rarest and most poorly understood members of the dinosaur assemblage. Until now, only a single, highly fragmentary frontoparietal dome (TMM 42010-1) has been reported from the Aguja Formation of Big Bend, and three poorly preserved domes (TMM 42532-1,-2,-3) are known from the San Carlos Formation, a lateral equivalent to the Aguja that is exposed to the west of Big Bend (Lehman, 1985) . The only other specimens of Pachycephalosauridae that are known from Big Bend are isolated teeth (Sankey, 2001) .",

One of us (Tanke) discovered a frontoparietal dome (LSUMNS 20010) on a large ironstone concretionary mass exposed on the floor of WPA-1, a multitaxon bonebed dominated by Agujaceratops. Following another visit to the area in December of 2008, a second specimen was recovered from beds above WPA-1, again in association with Agujaceratops. Although initial studies suggested that the Aguja pachycephalosaur might be referable to Stegoceras, upon closer examination the Aguja skull was found to differ from any previously described pachycephalosaurid taxon. Despite the limited nature of the material, and despite the fact that the holotype and referred specimens exhibit predepositional wear, the material is sufficiently diagnostic to warrant the creation of a new taxon.",

The second specimen, LSUMNS 20012, is fragmentary, but agrees well with LSUMNS 20010 in the preserved features, providing further evidence that the Texan specimens are distinct from previously known taxa. The systematics of the Aguja pachycephalosaur are of particular interest in light of the observation that the late Campanian of Big Bend supported dinosaur species that are not found to the north (Lehman, 1997; Sankey, 2001 ).",

The bonebed lies above the Terlingua Creek sandstone member, and within the lower part of the upper shale member of the Aguja (Lehman, 1989) . This accumulation is located in a grey siltstone that is thought to represent an interdistributary marsh (Lehman, 1989) . The referred specimen was recovered east of the bonebed, less than a kilometer away, and several tens of meters above WPA-1 (Fig. 2 ) in section. It was found as part of a deflation lag, along with numerous other dinosaur scraps that had weathered from an ironstone-cemented conglomerate. The only other diagnostic fossil recovered from this site is a parietal fragment from Agujaceratops.",

Other Pachycephalosauridae do have interdigitating sutures between the dome and peripheral elements, but the ridges are lower, narrower, and more numerous. Thus, the series of large articular flanges seems to be unique to Texacephale. Posteriorly, two shallow notches in the back of the dome appear to represent the margins of the supratemporal fenestrae.

Following first-hand examination of the fossils and study of the literature, it was found that the data matrix presented by Sereno (2000) has a relatively large number of miscoded characters: e.g. in this matrix, Stegoceras is miscoded for characters 5, 22, 30, and 37 (NRL, pers. obs. of UA2); 24 appears to be miscoded for Goyocephale (Perle et al., 1982) and cannot be coded for Wannanosaurus (Butler and Zhao, 2008) . Other codings are difficult to verify; e.g., characters 14 and 16 in Wannanosaurus). For this reason, a new character-taxon matrix was created. Characters include those taken from Sereno (2000) , Williamson and Carr (2002) , and Sullivan (2003) as well as new characters. Codings were made directly from specimens and casts, but where specimens or casts were not readily available, the literature was employed (Perle et al., 1982; Gangloff et al., 2005; Sullivan, 2006; Butler and Zhao, 2008) . Analysis was performed using PAUP* 4.0b10. The analysis follows previous studies (Sereno, 2000; Williamson and Carr, 2002; Sullivan, 2003) in using Psittacosaurus spp. as an outgroup; however because Stenopelix is fragmentary and its affinities are uncertain (Butler and Sullivan, 2009) , the well-known Thescelosaurus neglectus was used as an outgroup in its place.",

Yaverlandia bitholus and Micropachycephalosaurus hongtuyensis are no longer believed to represent pachycephalosaurids (Sullivan, 2003; Butler and Zhao, 2008) and were therefore excluded from this analysis. Ornatotholus browni (Wall and Galton, 1979) is now considered to represent a juvenile of Stegoceras (Williamson and Carr, 2002; Sullivan, 2003) and was excluded on this basis. Gravitholus albertae (Wall and Galton, 1979) has recently been referred to Stegoceras (Williamson and Carr, 2002; Sullivan, 2003) . However, Gravitholus exhibits characters that are not seen in Stegoceras. These include the absence of large nodes on the parietosquamosal shelf and an extremely broad, flat nasal boss; and therefore Gravitholus is treated as a valid taxon for this analysis. Sphaerotholus edmontonense has been considered a nomen dubium (Williamson and Carr, 2002) but the holotype NMC 8830 differs from S. goodwini in that the parietals are broad posteriorly and bear a pair of nodes, and S. edmontonense can be distinguished from S. buchholtzi by the longer parietals. Accordingly, Sphaerotholus edmontonense is treated as a valid taxon in this analysis.",

However, because the ontogeny of pachycephalosaurs is poorly understood, these forms were included. To test for the possibility that these forms are juveniles, an attempt was made to identify derived characters in these forms that are unrelated to the doming of the skull, and include them in the analysis. Analysis was conducted using the branch-and-bound search algorithm of PAUP* 4.0b10 (Swofford, 2002) . The analysis resulted in 45 most parsimonious trees of 127 steps. 11 characters were found to be parsimony-uninformative. When excluded, the resulting trees have a consistency index (CI) of 0.7500, a retention index (RI) of 0.8204, and a rescaled consistency index of 0.6281.

Vertebrates found in the Aguja, but not in contemporary northern assemblages include the dinosaurs Agujaceratops mariscalensis (Lehman, 1989; Forster et al. 1993) , Kritosaurus sp.

The Aguja also contains a number of non-dinosaurian vertebrates that are not found in contemporary strata to the north, including the crocodylians Deinosuchus (Colbert and Bird, 1954) and Goniopholis (Rowe et al., 1992) , the turtle Helopanoplia (Sankey, 2006) , the giant amiid Melvius, stingrays (Dasyatidae), and sawfish (Sclerorhynchidae) (Rowe et al., 1992) . In addition, the vegetation of the Aguja Formation differs from that of the Dinosaur Park Formation. Arborescent angiosperms are known from fossilized wood in the Aguja, along with podocarp (Podocarpaceae) and araucarian (Araucariaceae) conifers (Wheeler and Lehman, 2005) ; these taxa are not known from the fossil wood assemblages found in the Campanian of Alberta (Koppelhus, 2005) .",

Faunal differences between the top and bottom of the Dinosaur Park Formation are likely to result from evolution and extinction of species over time (Ryan and Evans, 2005) and the faunal differences seen in the Gobi redbeds are likewise thought to reflect differences in the ages of the deposits (Makovicky, 2008; Longrich et al., in press ). However, interpreting the distinct fauna of the Aguja as resulting from faunal succession is problematic, given that the Belly River and Edmonton groups of Alberta preserve a relatively continuous record of the vertebrate community, and none of the assemblages known from Alberta resemble the Aguja assemblage. Instead, we follow Lehman (1997) in interpreting differences between the Aguja and northern formations as resulting from regional differences in the paleocommunity structure. Such differences could result from geographic isolation, the differing climates of the regions, the differing vegetation structure of the various regions (Lehman, 1997) or some combination of these factors.",

What is perhaps unexpected is the high degree to which medium sized and large dinosaurs were able to segregate themselves compared to contemporary mammalian faunas (Lehman, 2001) , and their ability to do so within the confines of the relatively small area of Western North America. In general, there is a positive correlation between the body size of animals and their geographic range (Gaston and Blackburn, 1996) , and body mass of the largest tetrapods on a land mass is positively correlated with the area of that land mass (Burness et al., 2001) . Dinosaur species inhabiting the Late Cretaceous of Western North America would have had their potential ranges greatly reduced by the presence of the Western Interior Seaway, which divided North America into two separate landmasses. Yet, remarkably, non-avian dinosaurs were able not only to persist within the confines of the western land mass, they appear to have been able to segregate themselves such that certain taxa inhabited only a restricted portion of this land mass. Despite their limited geographic ranges, some of these taxa weighed many tons (Paul, 1997) . It remains unknown how so many species of large dinosaur were able to coexist in such limited areas.",

Much of what we know about dinosaur diversity in the final 10 million years of the Cretaceous comes from a relatively small area of the Western Interior that encompasses Alberta, Saskatchewan, Montana, Wyoming, and the Dakotas. It has been suggested that dinosaur diversity was in decline in the late Maastrichtian (Archibald, 1996; Sarjeant and Currie, 2001; Archibald and Fastovsky, 2004) , however this supposed trend is based almost entirely on the low diversity in the Maastrichtian of the Hell Creek and Lance Formations, versus the higher diversity in the Campanian beds of Alberta. The diversity patterns seen in the Western Interior of North America are then generalized to the rest of North America and to the rest of the globe.",

The taxa found in the south, such as Texacephale, Agujaceratops, and Kritosaurus, are distinct from those known from the North. The community structure differs as well. Chasmosaurine ceratopsids and hadrosaurine hadrosaurs dominate in the Aguja (Lehman, 1997) , whereas centrosaurine ceratopsids and lambeosaurine hadrosaurs are more common in the Belly River Group (Currie and Russell, 2005) . Furthermore, the assemblage appears to have been characterized by relatively low species richness. Relatively few dinosaur taxa are known from the interval (Table 1) , whether the fauna is examined in terms of large dinosaur remains (Lehman, 1989) or microfossils (Rowe et al., 1992; Sankey, 2001) , and the assemblage is dominated by just a few taxa, primarily Agujaceratops and cf. Kritosaurus. Although the low diversity is almost certainly exaggerated by the limited number of skeletons available from the Aguja, this does suggest that the exceptionally high diversity that is seen in the Campanian of Alberta may not have characterized North America as a whole. Dinosaur diversity is very much a local phenomenon; community composition and community structure can differ radically from one region to another. This is perhaps expected, but it does illustrate the difficulties in attempting to reconstruct largescale patterns in dinosaur diversity from a relatively limited geographic area.",

In this study, they are found to form a monophyletic assemblage, along with Prenocephale prenes and Tylocephale gilmorei, that is deeply nested within the Pachycephalosaurinae. This group is not well supported, with the clade being diagnosed by a single unambiguous synapomorphy (quadrate head articulating low on squamosal descending ramus; see Butler and Zhao 2009: Fig 6E) . However, numerous derived characters are shared by the domeless taxa and advanced pachycephalosaurines to the exclusion of Stegoceras. These include prominent nodes on the postorbitals (Goyocephale, Homalocephale, Wannanosaurus) enlarged nodes on the nasals (Goyocephale, unknown for Homalocephale and Wannanosaurus) and a reduced articulation between the frontal and supraorbital 1 (Goyocephale, unknown for Homalocephale and Wannanosaurus). Homalocephale and Goyocephale also exhibit a laterally deflected and paddle-shaped preacetabular process of the ilium, and a 'crown' formed by the lateral expansion of the squamosal and postorbital; these features are shared with Prenocephale (Marya\u00f1 ska and Osm\u00f3 lska, 1974) but are absent from Stegoceras (Gilmore, 1924) . Given this, and that Homalocephale and Prenocephale are remarkably similar in the construction of the palate, occiput, and pelvis, it seems almost certain that Homalocephale is a juvenile or a female of Prenocephale, which occurs in the same formation. Goyocephale can be distinguished from Prenocephale by the morphology of the ilium (Perle et al., 1982) but given that it is deeply nested in the Pachycephalosaurinae, it seems likely that it represents the juvenile or female of a fully-domed, Prenocephale-like form. Wannanosaurus may represent a valid taxon (Butler and Zhao, 2008) but again, it seems probable that it is a juvenile of a fully-domed form.",

However, it is worth exploring some of the implications of this unusual topology. One interesting implication is that if this topology is correct, then the long ghost lineages that are created by placing the flat-headed forms in a basal position would disappear. Another significant result of such an arrangement concerns the biogeography of the Pachycephalosauria. Placing the domeless Asian forms in a basal position would suggest an Asian origin of the clade (Marya\u00f1 ska et al., 2004) . In the arrangement presented here, the most basal pachycephalosaurians, including Stegoceras, Texacephale, and Hanssuesia, are all North American (Fig 7) ; the Asian pachycephalosaurs are most parsimoniously accounted for by a single dispersal from North America to Asia. The hypothesis of a North American origin for the group is consistent with the observations that (1) the earliest definitive pachycephalosaur is currently known from North America, rather than Asia (Sullivan, 2003) , and (2) the group appears to have had a much higher diversity in North America than in Asia.",

This topology is interesting, given the controversy over the validity of Dracorex (Bakker et al., 2006; Sullivan, 2007; Horner et al., 2007) . Bakker et al. (2006) distinguished Dracorex from Stygimoloch on the basis of three characters: (1) absence of the dome, (2) presence of the supratemporal fenestrae, and (3) four short hornlets on the squamosal (versus three long hornlets in Stygimoloch). Characters (1) and (2) are thought to be ontogenetic (Williamson and Carr, 2002) and therefore their utility for diagnosing Dracorex is questionable. Character (3) could conceivably represent a diagnostic feature of this taxon, however the precise number of nodes on the squamosal can vary; e.g. the holotype of Prenocephale prenes has 5 nodes on the caudodorsal margin of the right squamosal, and four on the left. What is perhaps more striking are the derived characters shared by Stygimoloch and Dracorex. These include a rosette of spike-like nodes centered around a single central, horn-like node, posterolateral elongation of the squamosals to form pedicels for the squamosal nodes, and midline contact of the squamosals (Goodwin et al. ,1998; Bakker et al., 2006) . Given this, the evidence for separating Dracorex from Stygimoloch is weak. However, the possibility that they represent distinct taxa cannot be ruled out entirely. More fossils are required to determine whether the differences between the two forms are discrete (as would be expected for two separate species), or simply extremes in a continuous range of variation, with the differences reflecting ontogenetic and/or intraspecific variation.",

However, the Aguja pachycephalosaur specimens come from coastal floodplain deposits, and the paleoenvironment has been interpreted as a densely vegetated coastal marsh (Lehman, 2007) . Both domes are worn, raising the possibility of transport (although weathering on the surface could also explain this damage). However, the pachycephalosaur teeth recovered from the Terlingua and Talley Mountain sites (Rowe, et al., 1992; Sankey, 2001 ) have more limited potential for transport, and show little evidence of wear. This suggests that pachycephalosaurs did inhabit the coastal lowlands of Cretaceous Texas. Surprisingly, no pachycephalosaurs have been reported from the more inland deposits of the Javelina Formation of Big Bend, despite the relatively high preservation potential of pachycephalosaur frontoparietals.",

The uppermost Foremost Formation, which was deposited in a coastal lowland environment, preserves an exceptional number of pachycephalosaur domes, even though other dinosaur remains are relatively rare here (NRL, pers. obs.) . Likewise, the coastal plain environment of the late Maastrichtian Hell Creek and Lance Formation contains a diverse pachycephalosaur assemblage, including Pachycephalosaurus, Stygimoloch, Sphaerotholus and perhaps Dracorex (Sullivan, 2006) . In contrast, upper Maastrichtian deposits from the inland Scollard Formation of Alberta have produced only two fragments of pachycephalosaur skulls, and no pachycephalosaurs are known from the inland, seasonally arid Frenchman Formation of Saskatchewan (NRL, unpublished data). Some pachycephalosaurs obviously were able to exploit inland environments (e.g., Tylocephale and Prenocephale in Asia) (Marya\u00f1 ska and Osm\u00f3 lska, 1974) but pachycephalosaurids are neither particularly diverse nor particularly common in these assemblages, and so there is little evidence to support the generalization that the Pachycephalosauridae as a whole favored inland habitats. The rarity of articulated skeletons of pachycephalosaurids compared to the dome probably does not reflect transport over long distances, instead it reflects two facts: (1) there are strong taphonomic biases against the preservation of small vertebrates as articulated skeletons in fluvial deposits, and (2) taphonomic biases favor the preservation of elements that are large, dense, and durable, e.g., pachycephalosaurid domes.",

                "text": "The function of the dome seen in Texacephale and other members of the Pachycephalosauridae has proven an almost inexhaustible source of speculation and debate. It has been proposed that the head served as a weapon (Colbert, 1955) , and in particular that the head may have been used in head butting of the kind practiced by extant bighorn sheep (Galton, 1970; Sues, 1978) . However, it has also been argued that the rounded domes would have tended to glance off of each other, making head-butting difficult or impossible; for this reason it has been suggested that the dome may instead have been employed in flank butting (Sues and Galton, 1987; Carpenter, 1997) or species recogntion (Goodwin and Horner, 2004) . However, the shape of the pachycephalosaur dome is not necessarily inconsistent with head-butting behavior. Although the apex of the dome may be narrow, the posterodorsal surface of the dome in Texacephale is broad and rounded. This broad posterodorsal surface is also seen in Stegoceras, Colepiocephale, Prenocephale and especially in Gravitholus; indeed this morphology appears to characterize all pachycephalosaurs with the exception of Stygimoloch (Goodwin et al., 1998) where the dome is laterally compressed. Furthermore, several bovids have evolved a horn morphology which grossly resembles the pachycephalosaurid dome. In the musk ox (Ovibos moschatus) and African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) the bases of the horns are extended medially and flattened so as to create a broadly domed, helmet-like boss (Nowak, 1991) . In both species this domelike structure is used in headbutting and head-to-head shoving matches (Lent, 1988; Lundrigan, 1996) . This does not necessarily prove that pachycephalosaurs did use their domes in the same fashion, but it does argue that the highly domed morphology of the pachycephalosaur skull does not preclude such a function. Goodwin and Horner (2004) have recently argued against the hypothesis that the dome functioned as a weapon; instead they argue that the dome functioned for species recognition. It was argued that the radial bone texture seen in the pachycephalosaur skull was a transitory feature, and that therefore this structure could not have been an adaptation for intraspecific combat. This may be, but it does not logically follow that if a particular feature is not an adaptation for intraspecific combat, then the dome cannot have functioned for combat. Species recognition also seems a rather unlikely function for the dome, given that it does not vary markedly between species. Although the details of the dome's construction vary between taxa, the domed shape of the skull is conserved across a wide range of taxa. For this reason, at first glance, Texacephale is easily mistaken for Stegoceras or Colepiocephale, for instance, and the differences between the various North American genera are sufficiently subtle that almost all North American pachycephalosaurs were referred to Stegoceras until recently. Indeed, the fact that the dome's general form is relatively conservative (when compared to the wildly varying crests of hadrosaurs and frills of ceratopsids) would have made it relatively useless for species discrimination, and instead argues for a set of mechanical constraints on its design, such as those imposed by intraspecific combat. Furthermore, the closure of the frontoparietal and frontalfrontal sutures, and the elaborate sutural flanges found in Texacephale, suggest that the elements of the dome had to be kept from dislocating under sizeable loads. Finally, it simply seems improbable that natural selection would favor the investment of such a large amount of material and energy in building, maintaining, and carrying several pounds of bone unless it had a strong effect on the animal's fitness that went beyond species recognition. Given that most animals can and do recognize other members of their species perfectly well without employing such elaborate and costly structures, this hypothesis does a poor job of explaining why the pachycephalosaurs would invest such an extraordinary amount of energy and resources into the cranial dome.",

                "text": "It seems possible if not probable that the dome was employed as a signaling device. The handicap of investing one's finite resources into such a large and expensive structure can make it an honest signal of fitness (Iwasa et al., 1991) . Expensive structures are therefore an effective tool for intimidating rivals in disputes, or courting members of the opposite sex. However, compared to a display structure such as a peacock's tail or a chameleon's frill, the structure requires a remarkable amount of material for what would be only a moderately impressive display. For this reason, it seems unlikely that display was the primary selective pressure behind the evolution of the dome. Some of the unusual features of the dome described above may have bearing on the issue of the dome's function. As described above, the skull of Texacephale is highly asymmetrical. The right side of the skull is distinctly more inflated than the left, and has taller sutural surfaces, indicating that the peripheral elements were larger as well. Although one might assume that this kind of asymmetry represents a serious pathology, examination of other pachycephalosaurid skulls reveals that this kind of asymmetry is common. Examples include Hanssuesia sternbergi (NMC 8817 and NMC 192) Stegoceras validum (NMC 38079, UALVP 2) and Prenocephale prenes (ZPAL MgD-I/104). Given this, it seems likely that the asymmetry seen in Texacephale and other pachycephalosaurids represents fluctuating asymmetry-random deviations from perfect, bilateral symmetry. Fluctuating asymmetry tends to be particularly well-developed in structures that are under strong sexual selection, either as weapons used in intraspecific combat (Moller, 1992) or display structures (Moller and Hoglund, 1991) ; for example, the antlers of deer frequently differ in their length, diameter, and number of the tines on each side (Ditchkoff et al., 2001) . The asymmetry seen in the pachycephalosaurs is therefore consistent with the hypothesis that these are sexually selected features, used either for display to potential mates, in combat for mates/territory, or both. Fig. 7 . Strict consensus of 46 most parsimonious trees, showing the phylogenetic position of Texacephale langstoni. 20 taxa and 88 characters were analyzed using PAUP 4.0b10, with Thescelosaurus and Psittacosaurus used as outgroups. The Asian forms form a monophyletic clade deeply nested in the Pachycephalosauridae and the remaining taxa are known from North America, suggesting that the group may have originated in North America.",
