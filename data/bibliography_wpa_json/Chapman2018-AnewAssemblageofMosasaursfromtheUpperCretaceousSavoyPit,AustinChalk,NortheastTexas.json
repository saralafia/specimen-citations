Throughout its history, the WIS was marked by numerous marine transgressions and regressions before the seaway disappeared by the end of the Cretaceous (Hancock and Kauffman, 1984; Young, 1986) . During the Early Coniacian, a marine transgression that began in the Late Turonian flooded North America with the second-highest sea levels of the Late Cretaceous, falling short of the Early Turonian transgressive event (Kauffman, 1984) . The WIS during the Early Coniacian was home to a variety of sea animals including the bird Ichthyornis, a number of fish such as Cretoxyrhina mantelli and Xiphactinus, ammonites, inoceramids, and a variety of marine reptiles. Among the latter category were the mosasaurs, a group of primarily marine squamates (Pannoniasaurus inexpectatus, described in Mak\u00e1di et al., 2012 , is an exception) that are traditionally aligned with the varanoid lizards (e.g., deBraga and Carroll, 1993; Conrad, 2008) , but other authors (e.g., Lee, 1997; Reeder et al., 2015) suggested these reptiles may have higher phylogenetic affinities with snakes.",

In Texas, the WPA was active from 1939 through to 1941 with 26 projects across the state including one at my study site, the Savoy Pit in Fannin County (worked March to September 1940; Evans, 1941) . Lloyd J. Ryman served as the Project Superintendent in Fannin County and worked in conjunction with the Bureau of Economic Geology at The University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin). At least some of the collected specimens were taken to an exhibit in Dallas and eventually made their way into the collections housed at the Vertebrate Paleontology Laboratory (VPL) at UT Austin. A large portion of the fossils collected at the site remain unprepared and only a handful were ever published, namely the fish Laminospondylus transversus (new taxon named by Springer, 1957) , Belonostomus (Bardack, 1968) , Apsopelix anglicus (Teller-Marshall and Bardack, 1978) , and Saurodon leanus (mentioned by Bardack and Sprinkle, 1969) and a specimen of the bird Ichthyornis dispar (Parris and Echols, 1992) . Apart from the preparation of some individual elements and a tentative identification, the mosasaurs (isolated elements and associated skeletons) were largely ignored since their collection in 1940.

Notes on the Savoy Pit excavation from the State-Wide Paleontologic-Mineralogic Survey for Texas (Evans, 1941) described the locality stratigraphy as follows Blue Eagle Ford shale forms the floor of the Savoy Pit. For ten feet above the shale, the walls consist of blue-gray argillaceous limestone cut by numerous vertical joints. Above this are two to three feet of thin-bedded limestone overlain by up to three feet of black clayey soil. Nodules of pyrite are widely scattered throughout the matrix. (Evans, 1941, pp. 52-53) The clayey soil formed as the result of weathering (Evans, 1941) . My examination of samples collected in 1940 and during a visit to the locality in January 2018 confirmed the presence of the two subunits ( Figure 2 ) though the 'upper' subunit is created through weathering and bioturbation. The lowermost consists of a clay-rich or argillaceous bivalve packstone with a medium light gray coloration (Munsell color N6; Figure 2a and b). Bivalve shell fragments (usually \u2264 1 mm) are abundant and are either cemented together by calcite or enclosed by mud. A gradational contact separates the two subunits and represents the extent of weathering and bioturbation effects on the normally gray chalk (Figure 2a ; Evans, 1941) . The 'upper' subunit (Figures 2a, and 5) is very pale orange (10YR 8/2) and often weakly lithified, massive, and displays pale yellowish orange (Munsell color 10YR 8/6; coloration from oxidation) mottling similar to in structure to Thalassinoides burrows. The 'upper' chalk fractures into thin flakes or irregular blocks and contains lenses of the original medium light gray limestone ( Figure   2c -e).",

In contrast, mosasaurines tend to possess longer sutures ending above or posterior to the fourth tooth position while halisaurines possess longer sutures terminating above or posterior to the sixth maxillary tooth position. The dorsal surface in the maxilla of the new taxon plateaus before dipping slightly in the nasal embayment with the deepest segment above the fifth tooth position. There is a gentle rise to the top of the thin posterodorsal lamina that covers the anterior fourth of the prefrontal and most of its ventrolateral surface (Figure 10c ). This suture does not exclude the prefrontal from the margin of the external naris where a length of approximately 1 cm of the prefrontal is exposed. The prefrontal prevents the lamina from contacting the frontal (the latter is not preserved).

Posteroventrally, the squamosal contacts the suprastapedial process of the quadrate with a longitudinally concave facet (1.5 cm in length). Of the four tooth positions preserved on the ventral surface of the pterygoid, only the middle two alveoli bear the basal enamel of the teeth and resorption pits. Whereas nothing can be said about the surface features and overall shape of the teeth, they were not mediolaterally flattened, and were smaller than the maxillary teeth based on the size of the preserved tooth roots. It is possible that the teeth could have become similar in size to the maxillary teeth anteriorly. As typically observed in russellosaurines, the teeth attach to the main body of the element, contrasting with the prominent descending ramus to which the pterygoid dentition of mosasaurines attaches (Palci et al., 2013; Joshua Lively pers. comm., 2016).",

That shelf rests on top of the prearticular process of the articular and serves as the base of Meckel's canal that probably transported the mandibular artery (Bahl, 1937; Oelrich, 1956; Russell, 1967) . A foramen is visible on the anterior margin directly underneath the coronoid suture that was postulated by Russell (1967) to have allowed a branch of the mandibular nerve to enter the surangular.",

The sub-rectangular predental rostrum also supports the hypothesis that the specimen is not referable to Tylosaurus 'kansasensis,' whose predental rostrum is rounded (Everhart 2005b ), but the difference in shape is contentious because Jim\u00e9nez-Huidobro et al. 2016 This may indicate intraspecific or ontogenetic variation if these two taxa are synonymous as suggested by Jim\u00e9nez-Huidobro et al. (2016) . Tylosaurus proriger, in contrast, always displays a short process \"well above midheight\" (Palci et al., 2013: p. 10, supplemental data matrix). The suprastapedial process of TMM 31051-64 is not deflected medially as it extends ventrally and ends in a downward-oriented triangular bulge. The suprastapedial process forms a stapedial notch that is dorsoventrally elongated and widely spaced. A medial protrusion is present on the suprastapedial process for the articulation of the supratemporal. No fusion exists between the suprastapedial process and the poorly developed infrastapedial process.

Dorsally, the tympanic margin is more tightly curved. The ascending tympanic rim comes close to contacting the mandibular condyle and does not rise medially towards the infrastapedial.",

The new taxon of the Early Coniacian (~89 to 90 Ma) helps to fill this gap in knowledge. It is possible that the burst of diversity and disparity experienced by early mosasaurines was driven by a marine transgressive event in the Late Turonian and Early Coniacian, the extinction of the ichthyosaurs 3 million years before the first mosasauroids, or the disappearance of the pliosaurid plesiosaurs following a brief overlap with the earliest mosasaurs that created openings for niche expansion, potentially as a combination of all three factors (Hancock and Kauffman, 1979; Kauffman, 1984; Haq et al., 1987; Schumacher, 2011; Fischer et al., 2016 ).",

Both elements have postorbitofrontal rami that were mediolaterally smashed postmortem, preventing proper articulation with the left squamosal ramus of the postorbitofrontal. The anteriormost portion of each ramus is missing. There is slight crushing on the expanded posterior of the right squamosal. The left squamosal is missing both the posterior parietal process and a dorsomedial portion of the anterior ramus. Most of the length of the squamosal consists of the postorbitofrontal ramus, a narrow process that projects anteriorly from its contact with the parietal and supratemporal. That process possesses a U-shaped trough along the dorsal surface that sutures with the squamosal ramus of the postorbitofrontal. Near the posterior end of the element (the final one-sixth of the total length), the squamosal expands ventrally. On the ventromedial face, the squamosal would contact the supratemporal along a largely flat ovoid surface split anterodorsally by a medial shelf, indicating an interdigitating suture with the supratemporal. Several foramina are present along this surface. The suture with the supratemporal becomes linear underneath the shelf and extends anterodorsally for ~4 cm. A second shelf forms the ventral border of the anterodorsal extension of the supratemporal sutural surface and would have divided this surface from the facet contacting the quadrate. The supratemporal would have overlapped the dorsomedial surface of the squamosal via a facet-like suture in the form of an elongate ovoid (Figure 12d). This facet terminates in a point anteriorly when it contacts the anterodorsally ascending ventromedial suture for the supratemporal, at least one centimeter from the posterior end of the trough that accepts the squamosal ramus of the postorbitofrontal.Posteriorly, the facet has a wider termination. The facet appears in the same proportions on both squamosals indicating this feature was not created by taphonomic alteration. The russellosaurine Russellosaurus coheni possesses a similar condition except the anterior termination in that taxon does not form the pointed tip of an ovoid but rather extends medially away from the squamosal ramus. The overall shape of the facet is triangular inRussellosaurus coheni with the apex pointing posteriorly. An overlapping supratemporal dorsomedial articulation on the squamosal is currently only known to occur in the new taxon and Russellosaurus coheni and may have indicated the plesiomorphic state in mosasaurs. Evaluation of the characteristic outside of Mosasauridae has been difficult due to the lack of squamosal preservation in 'aigialosaurs' and close relatives. On the posterior dorsomedial surface, a short (3 mm high), rounded parietal process protrusion is present approximately 1 cm posteriorly from the posterior termination of the facet and it cannot be determined if the supratemporal would have abutted this projection. The parietal would likely have not reached the dorsal surface of the squamosal. Other mosasaurs possess variable states of the posterodorsal projection (if preserved) ranging from the absence of a process (e.g., Russellosaurus coheni) to moderate or well-developed (e.g., Latoplatecarpus and Globidens dakotaensis) and may"

Both are somewhat crushed, and the left squamosal ramus may be crushed more extensively than its counterpart. Each element is missing the anterior end. The posterior termination of the left squamosal ramus is missing, and the posterior extent of the right squamosal ramus is concealed by ribs from posterior trunk vertebrae. Even with the preserved portions, there remains a possibility that some of the features described here were affected by taphonomic alteration.The dorsal surface is largely a flat face that becomes mediolaterally thinner moving posteriorly as the rounded ridge forming its lateral edge transitions into a thin vertically-oriented ridge. The medial face underneath the ridge is inclined at ~55\u00b0 from the horizontal up to the posterior 2 cm of the preserved element where it twists to become approximately horizontal. On the medial side, a short ridge projects nearly ventrally and runs along the length of the ramus near the ventromedial border, forming a trench-like sulcus.PalatineThe partial right palatine of TMM 31051-84 (Figure 13) preserves most of the articulation surface with the prefrontal although the nature of contact is distorted by crushing. The posterodorsal connection with the pterygoid is obscured except for the ventral portion of the articulation, which is preserved as a triangular trough. Most of the anterior and part of the medial side of the element are missing. The condition of the maxillary suture is indiscernible on the palatine where the posterior portion is present. At the articulation surface with the maxilla, the medial parapet is slightly dorsoventrally constricted, hinting at a palatine that would have enveloped the parapet as seen in mosasaurines (Joshua Lively pers. comm., 2017).PterygoidThe partial right pterygoid(Figure 14)appears to be substantially crushed. This created a trough in the medial surface of the quadrate ramus and rotated the dorsal sulcus approximately 90\u00b0 medially. The number of tooth positions in the pterygoid cannot be assessed in the new taxon due to a posteriorly and anteriorly incomplete tooth row. The dorsomedial side of the tooth row experienced heavy erosion within a fossa. This same erosion also formed a hole through part of the tooth row. The palatine and basisphenoid processes are unknown. Only the origin of the ectopterygoid process is present, and most of the length of the quadrate process is preserved."

No axis vertebra is preserved, and the exact length of the vertebral column and precise positions of the vertebrae cannot be determined. Without pygal and caudal vertebrae, it is unknown if the new taxon possessed a downturned tail.

Of those, the latter three are preserved in TMM 31051-84. Both neural arches(Figure 19a-e) are nearly complete except for a small portion of the posterodorsal surfaces and some of the margin of the dorsal process. The anterior surface is sub-rectangular for articulation with the occipital condyle of the skull. No ventral process occurs on the atlantal neural arch, but the rounded ventromedial surface would contact the intercentrum. Short synapophyses extend posteriorly in a state similar to Russellosaurina but unlike the elongate and sometimes pedunculate condition seen in Clidastes propython, Kourisodon puntledgensis, and other taxa within Mosasaurinae (Bell 1993; Bell and Polcyn, 2005). The dorsal process is marginally posterior to the anterior condylar surface (by ~2 mm). This growth features an anteriorly concave margin and is mediolaterally flattened with a rugose tip. Several fragments of vertebral neural spines are attached by matrix, obscuring the medial face of the left neural arch process. The dorsal neural spines likely touched in life. Medially, the atlantal neural arch possesses a saddle-shaped condylar surface. The posterior end near the synapophysis would articulate with the axis vertebra while the anterior half accepts the centrum.The atlas centrum(Figure 19f and g) is a squat bone that becomes anteroposteriorly thicker moving dorsally, forming an anterior lip. That protrusion is rounded with a slightly projected middle unlike the semicircular outline seen in Clidastes 27 propython. The dorsal face is shallowly excavated but largely flattened overall to serve as the floor of the spinal cord. The posterior surface articulates with the centrum of the axis posteriorly and possesses a rectangular outline that is divided in two by a rounded ridge running dorsoventrally. This ridge is more pronounced in the new taxon than in Clidastes propython. Ventrally, the articulation surface for the atlantal intercentrum forms a slight excavation as an elongate ovoid. Erosion has damaged the ventral, posterior, and dorsal"

                "text": "The dorsal surface of the cervical vertebrae consists of a dorsally-projecting neural arch that forms the upper and lateral boundaries of a channel through which the spinal cord would have passed. From the base of the neural arch above the cotyle, paired prezygapophyses project anteriorly with dorsomedially oriented facets running along their length. These facets would have articulated with the ventrolaterally oriented facets on the postzygapophyses of the previous vertebra. The latter processes project posteriorly from the neural arch above the condyle and slightly dorsal to the position of the prezygapophyses. A tall, mediolaterally flattened neural spine would have ornamented the top of the neural arch. Trunk vertebrae (Example in Figure 21) All of the cotyles of the trunk vertebral series are affected by crushing with only the element preserving an intact neural spine preserving the nearly circular outline. The condyle on the posterior ends of these elements are largely well-preserved, but some vertebrae display signs of dorsoventral crushing. One of the vertebrae is lacking transverse processes because of taphonomic alteration and three others have only one process remaining. Most of the trunk vertebrae preserve a neural arch that is crushed; the exception of three anterior trunk vertebrae. Most vertebrae preserve zygapophyses, zygosphenes, and zygantra. Anteriorly, the synapophyses are dorsoventrally elongate, taller than wide, and sub-rectangular in outline. The transverse processes extend farther laterally and the synapophyses appear to shrink in both height and width moving posteriorly down the trunk series. The exact transition in form down the spine is somewhat obscured by crushing. Anterior condyles lack dorsoventral compression, resulting in an almost circular surface. Compression of more posterior vertebrae is unknown due to postmortem crushing. Like the cervical vertebrae, the prezygapophyses and postzygapophyses of all trunk vertebrae possess ovoid facets oriented dorsomedially and ventrolaterally, respectively. Ribs At least 13 ribs are partially preserved based on the preserved heads that would have attached to the vertebral synapophyses in life. The other portions of ribs are isolated from their attachment sites. The ribs of the new taxon range in size and position in the vertebral column from the longer anterior ribs (largest preserved is roughly 15 cm in 31 length along its curvature but it is distally incomplete [Figure 22]) to the posterior, almost tooth-like ribs (lengths of ~4 cm or smaller). All are anteroposteriorly flattened and all except for the more posterior ribs possess compressed midlines forming a groove along the anterior and posterior faces. None of the ribs are articulated with vertebrae, many are cracked, and several are crushed. See Jim\u00e9nez-Huidobro et al. (2016) Referred specimen -TMM 31051-64, partial premaxilla and left quadrate DESCRIPTION Premaxilla The premaxilla of TMM 31051-64 (Figure 23) is missing most of the internarial bar (including the ventral keel), the anterior tip of the predental rostrum, the second left lateral tooth, and the distal ends of the anterior two teeth. Some minor crushing is evident along the dorsal surface of the anterior internarial bar. The intermaxillary bar is smashed toward the right lateral side and is missing the posterior distal portion. TMM 31051-64 possesses a large predental rostrum with a sub-rectangular outline anterior to the first two teeth. Elongate foramina of variable size are scattered (rather than evenly distributed or aligned) across the dorsal and lateral surfaces of the preserved premaxilla but are not present beyond the anterior margin of the posterior teeth."

For instance, if the surangular or coronoid were found without the rest of TMM 31051-84, the bones would have been referred to the russellosaurines. Similarly, an isolated quadrate or anterior trunk vertebra would indicate the presence of a mosasaurine. More confident identification should be based on several associated elements (e.g., a quadrate and frontal) that together should provide a less ambiguous combination of diagnostic features and aide in describing potential synapomorphies, autapomorphies, and plesiomorphies. The assemblage of mosasaurs from the Savoy Pit, specifically Tylosaurus nepaeolicus, Yaguarasaurinae cf. Russellosaurus coheni, and the new taxon has important implications for mosasaur evolution and biostratigraphy (Figure 27).
