Although four major investigations and some minor work have taken place at the site since its discovery in the 1930s, relatively little has been published. Prior to 1974, only Green's (1962) general account of the site as a well-stratified archaeological, paleontological, and geological locality has dealt with the site at any length.",

Although virtually all the data are potentially usable, the primary problems involved with correlating Green's (1962) and Kelley's (1974) data with that of the Lubbock Lake Project have resulted from the differences in descriptive terminology, measurement, field and laboratory methods, and recording procedures.

Work centered on the upper level deposits at the southwest corner of the site in order to correlate the stratigraphy of Wheat's (1974) trench A with the section in the lower reservoir cut and reconstruct a raore complete sedimentary sequence (Green, ms) . This work served as the fulcrum for a National Science Foundation grant in 1960. The grant enabled Green (1962) , with Jane Holden Kelley (1974) , to further test some of the upper occupation levels discovered in 1959 in addition to sampling strata from lower deposits at several places around the site (Fig. 4) . Concomittant with this field work, Kelley (1974) also made a re-study of the archaeological materials collected by previous workers. Major excavation had ceased by November of 1960 although a minor amount of profiling and artifact collecting took piace in 1961. Summaries of this work can be found in two published articles (Green, 1962; Kelley, 1974) and an unpublished manuscript (Green, ms) .",

However, any abrasion of this rusted encrustation will regenerate the oxidation process resulting in continued downward pitting on the raetal's surface, or cavitation (Leidheiser, 1971:180) .

A very thin, dark green film was observed on the shells and was probably one of a number of possible copper chloride corabinations (Gettens, 1964: 552 ). All of the shell casings did, however, display signs of stresscracking by their brittleness (one shell casing shattered when picked up by a student). This is caused by a dezincification of the shell which in turn causes minute fractures to develop both laterally and perpendicular to the metal itself during the corrosion process. This is generally the result of two agents: (1) the chemical environraent, particularly in the presence of ammonia, carbon dioxide, free oxygen, nitrates, carbonates, phosphates, and various alkalis; and/or (2) the presence of micro-organisms that produce acids which help germinate certain bacterial forms that often attack the intercrystalline structure itself (Leidheiser, 1971:79-233) .

In this case the bones were repeatedly coated with acetone in an attempt to strip the outermost acrylic or alvar coating and then were soaked in lukewarm tap x^ater for varying periods and scrubbed. It should be noted that since the bones had only been coated, the soaking had the effect of helping to lift off the coating from within. This procedure was effective in stripping off the acrylics in raost cases, and the alvar in sorae, but could only be used on the stronger bone material from the upper strata at the site.

The primary goal was to establish a composite of the geological and archaeological sequences. The present work of the Lubbock Lake Project has also concentrated on the documentation of the geological and archaeological deposits, in addition to other aspects such as; food economy, utilized resources, environraent, and behavior. The raajor differences between the two projects have been in the latter's raore current raethodology and scope of problera orientation, which, in general, reflect the advances raade within the archaeological field over the past decade. For this reason, a short discussion of the raethodology eraployed by each project will be presented.",

In order to determine the relative accuracy of Green's primary elevation and how it would affect comparison to LLP material, several artifact concentrations and stratigraphic breaks were compared (after conversion to centiraeters) in Block C with the records from adjacent units excavated by the LLP in 1974 . The results, however, were too variable (between 1 to 9 cm higher) and probably due to either a differential breakout of stratigraphic boundaries (especially within the soil horizons) and/or a slight two-dimensional slope which can vary both cultural and stratigraphical boundaries several centimeters over just one meter of profile distance in that area (8).",

The hearth (FA8-6) was initially encountered by the LLP at an elevation of 97305.0 cm. Just above this at 97308.0 cm was another feature (FA8-3) which is thought to be the occupational floor associated \\d.th the hearth r 30 (Holliday, personal communication). After plotting the vertical distribution of Kelley's material from that block (Fig. 18 ), the highest elevation of material associated with the hearth's edge was at 97311.9 cm.

Zone A correlates with substratum lA, while zone B would be equivalent to both substrata IB and IC; however, the uppermost portion of zone B was noted as having a different, clayey lithology (ms:28). Substratum ID was not observed by Green, probably due to its limited outcropping along the western side of Area 5 ( Fig. 24 ). This unit is tentatively considered as a colluvial shore facies of substratum IC (Stafford, 1977:101 ).",

This interpretation is fundamentally correct, although Stafford (1977:88-110) has demonstrated that each substratum is sediraentologically raore coraplex than previously thought and may, in some cases, be conteraporaneous depending upon a unit's position within the channel. Green (1962: (Fig. 20) into the 2A laminated diatomite, 2B diatomaceous earth, 2E sandy shore facies contemporaneous with 2A and 2B, 2C cienega, and terminal 2F sand wedge. Green (Fig. 19 ) recognized a similar, but slightly different profile. He divided substratum 2A into a lowermost pure diatomite zone (A) and a laminated diatomite zone (B) on the basis of what he considered a slight climatic change from unique, highly stabilized environmental conditions of pure diatoraite deposition to a raore flucuating seasonal deposition represented by laminated diatomite (Green, ms:33) . Both Green (ibid.) and Stafford (1977:112) attribute the basal diatomite to separate episodes of diatom accumulation interrupted only by occasional intercalated near-shore, sand laminae (Figs. 25, 26, 27) . Above this the diatomite is distinctly separated by alternating intervals of varying organic mud deposits.",

The source of the 2F sands may likewise be of Blanco Formation sediments that were washed into the basin and mixed with the stratum 2 marsh/lake muds to produce a conformable contact (Stafford, 1977:129) . The bioturbated appearance of this contact, however, and its raassive alluvial character, make this unit distinctive. C.

Stafford (1977) has chosen to keep this designation for the sake of terminological continuity. Green (1962) Resting unconformably upon stratum 4 is stratum 5.

Features were defined on the basis of thin (2 to 6 cm) sterile soil zones between apparent living surfaces and show a linear but sloping distribution. To a certain degree, however, individual features are designated somewhat arbitrarily since some sterile soil zones do occur within parts of a feature, especially in Blocks A^ through C (Fig. 31 ). This would seem to suggest that some of the archaeological deposits in these features are a result of discreet, occupational activities which are temporally so close that they are, for the most part, indistinguishable.

Green (1962; ms) suggested that this feature represented some ceremonial or ritualistic significance and was not a random heap of discarded bones. This suggestion was based on the roughly circular arrangeraent of the skulls, the paucity of other bones, and the intact braincase on several well preserved specimens (indicating that the brain was not utilized) ( Fig. 49 ).

While this typological assignment is still basically correct, Wheat (1972) has re-defined some of the types and terminology. Holliday (1977) has determined frora surface raaterial that several Late Paleoindian cultures were probably present at the site, although the raost common cultural type found \u00b1n situ appears to be that of Firstview. One Firstview-like projectile point (TTU-A863; see Fig. 76 ) was recovered from feature GA12-3. It has been extensively re-worked along both lateral margins which has significantly altered its original shape; however, projected raeasureraent indices indicate that it would typologically be along the lines of Firstview (Holliday, 1977:24) . Most of the re-working had produced a serrated edge indicating secondary use as a knife, probably in butchering. Wheat (1977) obtained a sirailar pattern of modification on Kersey points from the Jurgens site. Other lithics associated with feature GA12-3 include a core (TTU-A974; see Fig. 79a ), a broken scraper (TTU-A973; see Fig. 79c ), a fragment of ironstained, raicacecus sandstone, one utilized and three waste flakes. In addition, a broken incised tubular bone bead (TTU-A916) was recovered.",

This is particularly evident in a recent paper (E. Johnson et al., 1977) on the Garza occupation at the site. The inclusion of Green's (1962) material from Area 8 helped to define the different utilization of the site environs by the Garza peoples. The information presented in this study has also documented in detail several micro-activity areas within the Garza occupations in addition to several raacro-activity areas in different substrata and culture horizons that have not been previously sampled. Specifically, these include the Paleoindian levels in Area 12, upper strata deposits in Area 7, stratum 4 deposits in Area 8, and stratum 3 deposits in Areas 4 and 12.",

A number of stone tools, utilized flakes, and types of butchering and bone processing damage have now been identified which had not been noted at the time of excavation. This, in turn, has added some new insights into the interpretation of the raaterial and will provide a basis for additional research in determining the findings of this study in relation to the overall picture of past events at the site. The documentation and conservation of the collection according to raodern museum management techniques will greatly benefit any future studies by providing for an easier access to the information, records and raaterial. As a revived and viable research collection, the objects and their associated data can be utilized as an educational mediura, both today and in the future. As Daifuku (1974:124) has said: 'Live' as against 'dead' storage is one of the keys to the well being of a museum. There is little sense in having collections which cannot be used owing to lack of records, or to inability to locate them, or in keeping them under conditions which lead to their deterioration. x: (1977) \\/ H/\\ LLP 1977 ",

The same type of bone preservation also occurs stratigraphically higher in 5A and raay also be the result of a weak Ochrept (Fig. 32) . The hearth in this feature actually consists of two superimposed separate hearths. Unfortunately, no distinction between the upper and lower levels can be made based upon the vertical plot of bones and artifacts from within these levels (Fig. 32) . Therefore, although treated singularly, it is recognized that the two levels probably represent spatially separate events and activities of short duration. Other than the vertical profile in Figure 34 , little is known of the characteristics or conf iguration of the lower level. The only raapped items are those recorded from the upper most level (Fig. 63) , and as such, any discussion of horizontal placement is restricted to that level. Charcoal from the lowermost level of the hearth 14 has produced a C date of 160 + 90 years B.P. (Fig. 34 ). The flake scraper (TTU-A22397) is made from a grayish orange (10YR7/4) chert.

The latter are most common to the major wind deflated playas on the Llano Estacado today and would explain the limited areal extent of the known 02 deposits (Stafford, 1977). Many of the well-rounded bone fragments deposited with stratum 02 may have been derived from the previously eroded 01 deposits. Green (ms:22) recovered a few poorly preserved and unidentifiable bone fragments from stratum 01 in Blocks F and G (Area 12). Intermittent exposure to the eleraents before final burial by channel wash or lacustrine sediraents would have similarly abraded some of the bone material and, undoubtedly, had an effect on the caliche gravels at the base of stratum 02. Stafford (1977:81) has recently observed the rapid fracturing and weathering of 1-5 cm blocks of \"bedrock\" dolomite and concludes: \"The dolomitic clasts give the anomalous appearance of having traveled long distances downstream whereas their true source raay have been only meters away.\" It is most plausible then that the pebble conglomerate is derived from a very localized source of 01 dolomite just to the east and may have undergone only liraited raechanical weathering to attain their degree of abrasion.",

The stratigraphic sequence within each set of blocks was virtually identical except for minor variations in sub-unit thickness(Figs. 17, 33)  and elevation. This was confirmed by LLP test excavations adjacent to Blocks C and K in 1974. Due to the limited nature of the test excavations, however, the variations in thickness and elevation prevented precise intra-area correlation between the feature raaterial recovered from each block area. At the time no profiles of Blocks I, J, or K had existed.As part of this study, three large geologic profiles (Trenches 104 through 106) were mechanically excavated along the southern margins ofGreen's and Kelley's blocks (Fig. 16). The resulting geologic cross-section (Fig. 69)shows a raore precise relationship between the individual substrata and slope increment (1 vertical meter:20 horizontal meters) for this area. All of the substrata are easily traced along the length of the profile, except for the upper part of substratum 5B in Trench 104. At this point some slightly different characteristics of soil formation and an unusual amount of disturbance made differentiation and substrata delineation extremely difficult.Kelley (n.d.)  observed the same kind of phenomenon in trying to assign Green's stratigraphic scheme to her own blocks. This is reflected in Kelley's profile of Block K (Fig. 17).At present, there are no profiles of Blocks I and J known to exist; however, a satisfactory reconstruction of their stratigraphic \"^ sequence was extrapolated by utilizing various field notations on stratigraphic boundaries(Kelley, n.d.), the cross-section profile inFigure 69, and a scaled profile photograph of the northeast corner of Block I(Fig. 67). Both the projected profile and artifact distribution for Blocks I, J, and K are shown inFigure 18. The artifact distribution for Blocks A. , A, B, and C is taken directly from Green's (n.d.) profile of those blocks and is shown inFigure 31.A comparison of Figure 18 and 31 shows a very similar vertical distribution of artifacts and feature zonation. Stratum 4 yielded the smallest amount of archaeological material and no diagnostic artifacts. Green did not recover any raaterial frora substratum 4B. Kelley recovered a large pebble of burned silicified caliche, a flake of Edwards Plateau chert, and part of a Morrison quartzite cobblefrom Block K. Two occupational zones, GA8-11 at the 4B/4C contact and GA8-10 in the uppermost part of 4C, are located in Blocks A^ through C(Fig. 31). A similar pattern can be seen in Blocks K and I, except that the artifact distribution within substratum 4C is more variable(Fig. 18). Three occupational zones have been defined: KA8-12 at the 4B/4C contact, KA8-11 within the middle of 4C, and KA8-10 at the top of 4C.All of the stratum 4 features share the same characteristics.They are sparsely distributed and contain raostly burned silicified caliche, a few lithics (primarily of Edwards Plateau chert), and some bone scrap (sometimes burned). A few bone elements have been identified as that of bison. The artifacts recovered from features GA8-11 and KA8-12 at the 4B/4C contact include 63 pieces of burned silicified caliche, 16 small flakes and pieces of debitage, one large, heat-treated flake, and a side scraper (TTU-A781; see Fig. 52);while those from feature KA8-11 in the middle of 4C include eight pieces of burned caliche, two retouch/resharpening flakes, and three utilized flakes. Features GA8-10 and KA8-10 from the uppermost part of 4C produced 11 pieces of burned silicified caliche, a small broken flake scraper (TTU-A763; seeFig. 48a), two flecks of charcoal, eight retouch/resharpening flakes, and a mano fragment (TTU-A23852) of bumed silicified caliche. Six of the flakes (TTU-A23777) were found in a pile at the western corner of Block K(Fig. 17)and probably represent an individual tool retouch/resharpening station.Although somewhat meager, the artifact and faunal remains of substratum 4C suggest that the repeated occupational zones are representative of a series of encampment activities.A similar sequence is seen in the lower half of substratum 5Awhere a number of caliche gravel lenses are present(Fig. 69). A number of artifact zones have been discreetly separated frora each other by the lenses of slope-wash colluviura(Figs. 18, 31). The cultural material recovered was sparse in both quantity and distribution. Feature material consists primarily of bone fragments of Bison bison, a few flakes, and pieces of burned silcified caliche.A snub-nosed thumbnail scraper (TTU-A716; seeFig. 51) was recovered from Block A of feature GA8-9. Green (ms) originally placed this item at the 4B/4C contact, but a re-check of the field measurements indicates that a placement at the base of substratum 5A is more appropriate.The upper feature zones of substratum 5A show evidence of a more intense, repeated aboriginal occupation(Figs. 18, 31).",

At present, there are no raaps or records of its horizontal configuration or contents. The upper hearth level and associated habitational floor is shown in Figure 63. Two concentrations of burned caliche and burned and unburned bone are noticable within the hearth area. It is not known whether two adjacent or one large, subsequently disturbed hearth is represented; however, the presence of a large quantity of unburned raaterial suggests that it had been partially exhumed after its initial use and later filled with refuse. The majority of bone material strewn throughout the hearth and upper living floor consists of at least three bison. The raost numerous elements are vertebrae and rear distal limb elements. All of the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae display breakage from the butchering process, presumably from the removal of the hump meat and ligaments. Several have also had portions of the centrum chopped away. All of the long bones, including metapodials, have had their shafts broken and are represented only by the distal or proximal segments. As expected, bone shaft fragments are relatively numerous (>^ 200 pieces). This would suggest that the manufacture of bone grease had been a prominent activity. Elements represented by a small number of fragments include ribs, pelves, and skull parts. One left inominate (TTU-A22276) shows extensive butchering damage including multiple blow marks to the internal wall of the acetabulum (for detachment of the femur). The same butchering technique was seen in two specimens from feature GA8-7 in Area 8. Other, unmapped, faunal material includes wolf (Canis lupus), coyote (Canis latrans), box turtle (Terrapene ornata), and mud turtle (Kinosternon flavescens). All of the recovered lithics come from within the hearth area. They consist of a groundstone (metate?) fragment, a broken side scraper (TTU-A22373; see Fig. 65) of Alibates chert, two utilized flakes, and five small waste flakes. Charcoal from the lowermost hearth level was dated at 160 + 90 years B.P. (1-208, in Trautman and Walton, 1962:40). Green (ms) considered this date to be too young in view of the geological evidence. Some contamination may have resulted from its close proximity to the edge of the reservoir cut. Three samples each of charcoal and bumed bone have been taken from an upper, middle, and lower zone of the hearth and are slated for 14 future C processing. The dates should provide an interesting bracket for both hearth level occupations and comparison to the 14 earlier C date. Feature GA7-6 is undoubtedly the living surface extension of feature GA7-5, although to what extent it is not clear. Most of the artifacts have a highly variable elevation range (Fig. 32) and cannot be distinctly associated with either hearth level in feature GA7-5.

The presence of numerous, burned caliche pebbles and calcined bone indicates that a hearth had been nearby.The lithics from this feature consist of a broken biface (TTU-A22294; seeFig. 61), a broken side scraper, a flake, and two pieces of debitage.

Three distinct piles of disarticulated Bison antiquus bone representing one individual per pile were raapped (Fig. 86). One side scraper (TTU-A922; see Fig. 87) was found in Block F a meter and a half away from one pile. Unfortunately, raost of the bones recovered from this feature have suffered considerable post-excavation damage and depletion, and no specific butchering pattems can be discussed. At least one individual was an adult and another a juvenile, probably a young four year old as based on the epiphysial closing schedule of several elements(Koch, 1935). The recovery of one fetal phalange (TTU-A23731) indicates the presence of at least one calf-bearing female. Although no diagnostic artifacts were found, the stratigraphic position of this feature would place it within the Plainview period horizon at the site as defined by Holliday(1977)  andGreen (ms).An activity zone, feature GA12-4, is also located at the top of substratum 2B. No cultural affiliations can be assigned to this feature, although it is probably a result of Late Paleoindian (Firstview culture?) period activity(Holliday, 1977). Only one flake and a broken flake scraper (TTU-A921) were found in addition to several small animals. One notable aspect of this feature is the recovery of an intact, articulated pronghom antelope skeleton (TTU-A903; seeFig. 85) found in Block G.Green's (ms:37)  description of the animal's in situ posture indicates that the individual had died a natural death. A chopper or core (TTU 58-72-2; seeFig. 88) of chemically altered, silicified caliche was found near this area and may be associated with this feature. Green (ms) recovered the tool, now missing from the collections, from the uppermost six inches of substratum 2B while profiling near the location of Trench 47 (Fig. 16)in 1958.

A lanceolate biface (TTU 60-47-285; seeFig. 71), now missing, of light gray (Edwards Plateau?) chert was also recovered from Block T. Green (ms) believed it to be a knife and stated that it had been \"thinned by percussion flaking and edged by pressure chipping.\" The chronostratigraphic position of this feature would make it an equivalent to the Plainview period horizon at the site(Holliday, 1977). Green (ms) had correctly ascribed this feature to the Plainview culture based on an estimate of the time interval for deposition of the laminated diatomite between this bone bed level and the lower Folsom horizon.Two other probable bison kill/butchering locales were sampled in the upper part of substratimi 2B (feature GA5-2) and lower part of substratum 2C (feature GA5-1) (Fig. 26). Feature GA5-1 is probably the extension of a butchered juvenile skeleton recovered in FA5-8 (E.. Unfortunately, most of the skeletal elements from both features GA5-2 and GA5-1 have suffered greatly from past storage conditions and little can be said of butchering patterns or techniques. No diagnostic artifacts were recovered, but the stratigraphic context would suggest a late Paleoindian, probably Firstview, activity(Holliday, 1977). Curiously enough, juvenile bison elements have been present in features GA5-3, GA5-2, and GA5-1 and raay represent a behavioral selectivity for the younger aniraals and their more tender meat.\u2022% Stratum 3 yielded little material and no features were delineated. Only one broken distal femur of a pronghorn antelope (Antilocapra americana) and a flake (TTU-A23608) of chemically altered chert were recovered. The most extensive cultural deposits containing bone and lithic material were recovered frora substratura 5C. Unfortunately, very little provenience information on the material exists. Three lithic items from Block EE with associated provenience were featured as GA5-4. They include a metate fragraent, biface fragment, and a piece of obsidian debitage.

Broken tools and fragments are listed by maximum dimension zone containing mammal bone scrap and pieces of metal cans, nails, and fragments. ILLUSTRATION: Mapped orientations of mostly the metal objects are on file at The Museum of Texas Tech University. DISCUSSION: The most prominent artifacts of this feature are the metal objects. Six square nails are represented in addition to parts of four others. Other metal pieces are too fragmentary and corroded for identification, except for one whole, squashed, tin can (TTU-A20) and part of another (TTU-A19) (Fig. 14). The only lithic items associated with this feature are one small burned caliche pebble and a possible end scraper (TTU-A13) made of silicified caliche. The latter appears roughly triangular (L45; W32) in outline with a relatively highbacked (T18) dorsal ridge, running medially three-quarters of the length from the apex. One lateral edge is slightly burned while the distal end displays steep retouch along three-quarters of the edge. It is not known if this retouch is \"modern\" or aboriginal. Faunal remains include a nuchal (Terrapene ornata), vertebra (Canis latrans), and approximately 50 pieces of bone scrap, mostly rib and bone shaft fragments, from a very large mammal. One group (TTU-A41) of long bone shaft fragments display jagged, but sharp breaks, and may be the result of purposeful pounding and breakage. Most of this material is from a concentrated area (0.5 X 0.75 m) in Block A. Feature GA8-1 correlates stratigraphically with LLP features FA8-1 and FA8-11, and possibly with features KA8-1 and KA8-2. restricted to Blocks A and A of Area 8. Two .45 caliber shell casings (TTU-A377, TTU-A378) were found together near the eroded edge of Block A^. Both are one and one-quarter inches in length and approximately 0.47 of an inch in diameter. Despite removal of corrosion at the base, no manufacturer's markings are listed. The lithics consist of one flake and a side scraper of Edwards Plateau chert found in the southwest corner of Block A-. The flake (L40; W35) ranges from yellowish (5Y8/1) to light olive (5Y6/1) gray, and shows a prominent percussion bulb, and a hinge fracture at the distal end. The side scraper (Fig. 36) was made from a cortex flake and displays a graver-like projection at the apex. It is dark yellowish brown (10YR4/1) in color. Only one, very small potsherd of a thin-walled (T4), mica tempered, blackware was recovered. This came from Block A. This feature may also have affinities to features GA8-1, zone containing waste flakes, burned caliche, bison, and non-bison faunal material. ILLUSTRATION: Horizontal provenience is not known for all the material from this feature. Those that are mapped are on file at The Museum of Texas Tech University. located in Blocks A, B, and C only. Lithic remains consist primarily of waste debitage of Edwards Plateau chert ranging in mottled color from yellowish gray (5Y8/1) to light olive gray (5Y6/1). Some also show a slight pinkish gray (5YR8/1) tint which may be indicative of heat-treatment. Of the eight flakes represented, one small (MD12), thinning flake (TTU-A83) shows tiny retouch or use scars along the lateral margin near one broken edge. The seven pieces of burned caliche show a mean diameter of 10-35 milimeters and are wellrounded, except for three angular pieces. The faunal remains are primarily those of Bison bison. Elements include teeth, a dentary symphysis, sternum, rib fragments, broken metapodials, tibia shaft debris, two phalanges, and other long bone fragments. At least two individuals are represented, based on two broken, right metatarsals. The epiphysial union and size differential of these two would also suggest either a young and old adult, or male and female combination. Both metatarsals (TTU-A105, TTU-A406) display similar, spiral breakage of the shaft at the same point from the distal end. This, in addition to the lack of cancellous bone at the smooth interior portions of shaft near the breaks, would suggest intentional breakage for marrow extraction. This is also corroborated by the numerous pieces of fractured tibia and other long bone shaft fragments. Non-bison remains are represented by elements of turtle (Terrepene ornata), prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus), and pronghorn antelope (Antilocapra americana). This feature stratigraphically correlates with features KA8-3 and FA8-7 (LLP). snub-nosed scraper (TTU-A399; see Fig. 40) has steep retouch on three sides with heavy damage flake scaring along the edges, and particularly the distal end. Its color ranges from light (N7) to medium (N5) gray with light bluish gray (5B7/1) specks throughout. Another scraper (TTU-A96; see Fig. 41) made from a cortex flake struck off of a cobble exhibits steep, micro-flake scaring along half of the right lateral edge. This may, however, be more from usage than intentional retouch. Its color ranges from very light (N8) to medium light (N6) gray. Two scraper fragments, TTU-A186 (MD18) and TTU-A346 (MD23), show steep, unifacial retouch with some tiny bifacial damage scars. Another tool fragment (TTU-A196; MD13) has a similar unifacial flaking pattern with some minute edge damage, and may also be part of a broken scraper. All three are of the same medixim light (N6) to medium dark (N4) gray color. One broken, blade-scraper (L33; W21) shows alternate retouch and use scars along the length of one edge. It ranges frora yellowish (5Y8/1) to light olive (5Y6/1) gray in color. Three smaller (MD less than 19) blade fragments are of the same color.One (TTU-A135) exhibits small, alternate, damage scars on each lateral edge. Another blade mid-section (L20; W18) displays minute damage scars on one lateral edge.",

One concentration, in particular, near the eastern border of Block B, contained 124 flakes and pieces of debitage or 42.5% of the total recovered from this feature. The utilized flakes numbered 38 or 36.5% of the total recovered from this concentration. Observed edge damage categories include: steep (> 45 edge angle)retouch and/or damage flake scars-15 specimens; alternate steep damage flake scars with two or more edge notches-1 specimen; steep damage flake scars on one side with two or more edge notches-1 specimen; steep damage flake scars on one side with one edge notch-1 specimen; alternate steep damage flake scars with one edge notch-1 specimen; unifacial damage scars (< 45 edge angle)-6 specimens; unifacial damage scars with one edge notch-4 specimens; alternate edge damage scars-4 specimens; and very fine, minute damage scars-5 specimens. All of the lithic material frora this concentration was of Edwards Plateau chert in approximatley the same proportions of color value and chroma as previously listed for the whole group of lithics.Othe materials recovered include a fragraented ground stone (TTU-A226) and two raetate fragraents (TTU-A458) made of micaceous sandstone; five pieces of hematite/limonite, one (TTU-A154) of which has been ground on one side (paintstone?); seven pieces of raollusc shell; two fragments of tubular bone beads (TTU-A218); flecks of charcoal; and 196 pieces of angular to sub-angular burned caliche (mostly silicified) ranging from 5 mm to 60 mm (MD). In addition, 32 potsherds consisting of two different types were recovered. One type is a thick, heavily brushed exterior and polished interior, utility ware, rangiiig in color from reddish brown to black and with a coarse, angular temper of shale or mudstone grit. The rim sherd (TTU-A151; seeFig. 42a) has a slightly flared, flat lip with horizontal brush marks; while a basal body sherd (TTU-A397, TTU-A398; seeFig. 42B) exhibits diagonal brush raark decoration.The other type consists of relatively thin-walled (T5) olive brown to (mostly) black colored utility ware with a mica and well-rounded quartz, sand temper. The interior is also very polished and the decoration horizontal; however, the brush raarks are very fine and indistinct.No rim or basal body sherds of this type were recovered.Bones of Bison bison, or fragraents thereof, are the raost numerous of the faunal remains. By the number and size difference of the 2nd and 3rd phalanges present, at least two individuals are represented in this feature. One individaul was a juvenile, or at least sub-adult, as indicated by one lurabar vertebra without the epiphysial plates, and the proxiraal epiphysial plate of a tibia. Except for the phalanges, an astragalus, and one right raetacarpal, all of the bison eleraents are incoraplete or fragmentary. These elements mostly include parts of humeri, feraora, tibiae, raetapodials, scapulae, hyoids, pelves, vertebrae, and skull bones. All three vertebrae have their spines raissing, and one (TTU-A255) has had its centrum chopped away. Also, one right acetabular fragraent (TTU-A432) exhibits evidence of a massive blow raark and crushing to its anterior, ischial shaft segment. In addition, repeated blows to the central acetabular margin has resulted in scallop-like edge daraage. Long bone shaft and rib fragments comprise the bulk of broken elements, numbering approximately 150 pieces each. A few fragments are 100 ram (MD) or larger, although the majority are between 40 and 60 mra (MD) in size. Several, especially the long bone fragments, display modification cf their edges in the forra of crushing of flake removal as a result of breakage from pounding. A dozen pieces of bone debitage exhibit the same characteristics (i.e., striking platform, bulb, etc.) as that of lithic flakes and as such are considered bone flakes. Other fauna represented are coyote (Canis latrans), pronghorn antelope (Antilocapra americana), and box turtle (Terrapene ornata). EQUIVALENT: Correlates stratigraphically with LLP features FA8-2 and FA8-12, in addition to feature KA8-4. hearth is located in Block A. Recovered material includes burned silicified caliche hearthstones, some bison bone, lithics, and pottery. Except for the caliche, none of the other items show any sign of charring and thus were dumped into the hearth as debris after it has already cooled. All 27 flakes and pieces of debitage recovered were of Edwards Plateau chert, ranging in color from light gray (N7) to light olive gray (5Y6/1). Six pieces appear to have been heat-treated and show a slight reddish tint. Four flakes exhibit steep (> 45 edge angle) retouch and/or damage flake scars along the margin of one edge. A fragmented cortex flake of raoderate yellowish brown (10YR5/4) quartzite was also recovered. Of the five potsherds found, three are of the same thickwalled (T6) type composed of a micaecous, sandy temper also found in GA8-4. The 117 pieces of burned silicified caliche hearthstones are raostly angular to sub-angular and range in size (MD) frora 10 mm to 56 mm, although the majority cluster at 25 ram. Faunal reraains are meager and consist of Bison bison material and mararaal bone scrap. In addition to miscellaneous pieces, the bison bone is represented by two carpals, four rib fragments, and shaft fragments of a tibia, femur, and radius. One bone flake (TTUfeature contains four pieces of bumed caliche, and skill, rib, tibia, femur, long bone shaft fragments, two thoracic vertebrae, and a right pelvis of Bison bison. The pelvis (TTU-A23761, TTU-A23762) was found in separate locations approximately a raeter apart in Block B. The ischial portion had been detached as a result of two alternate blow raarks near the acetabular raargin. Both ends of the ilium and ischiura, as well as the acetabulum, are incomplete and show considerable edge damage, probably the result of being chopped off. Many of the long bone shaft fragments also display some forra of modification. One femur shaft segment (TTU-A23760) has had the distal portion completely removed while the opposite end shows spiral breakage at about mid-diaphysis. A large tibia shaft fragment (TTU-A23765) also exhibits a spiral breakage pattern, some concave edge crushing along one margin (that may have been the fragment's detachment blow), and two negative flake scars along another edge. The whole shaft segment has also been split longitudinally into two pieces. It is not known whether this is the result of blows to the anterior surface or posterior edge where the negative flake scars are located. Both segments display secondary raodification along this longitudinal break. Two other shaft fragments (TTU-A508, TTU-A333) also exhibit some secondary edge daraage and crushing. At least two young animals are represented in this feature, based on two thoracic vertebrae (TTU-A510, TTU-A509) of greatly different size and missing epiphysial plates. Both have their upper spines broken. EQUIVALENT: Possibly associated with LLP feature FA8-13, but precise stratigraphic correlation is uncertain. May also be an upper continuation of feature GA8-7, although separated by a few centiraeters of sterile soil. area comprised of raulti-occupational zones, containing lithics and burned caliche as well as nuraerous bison and wolf remains. ILLUSTRATION: Horizontal placement of raapped iteras in Figure 44. DISCUSSION: Feature extends throughout Blocks A^, A, B, and C. Lithic items include projectile points, scrapers, utilized flakes, debitage, and raetate fragraents. Three Garza points and the corner tang of a Harrell point (TTU-A515) were recovered. All were made of Edwards Plateau chert ranging in color frora light olive (5Y6/1) to olive (5Y4/1) gray (3 speciraens) or slightly translucent raedium dark (N4) to dark (N3) gray (1 specimen). The latter is characteristic of one finely flaked Garza point (TTU-A633, TTU-A636; see Fig. 45a) with a small, incipient basal notch. The pcint had been broken in the middle. Both halves were found in close proximity in Block A-. One point base (TTU-A602; see Fig. 37b) is unifacially flaked with the basal notch having been flaked bifacially. Another unifacially flaked tool tip (TTU-A516; see Fig. 37c) with a steeply retouched edge is of the same color and relative thickness, and may have possibly been the distal tip of TTU-A602. The third point (TTU-A603) is a finely flaked mid-section that had been broken at the distal, basal, and lateral margins. Two bifaces of mediura dark (N4) to dark (N3) gray Edwards Plateau chert were also recovered. One small (WIO; T1.2) finely flaked fragment (TTU-A654) may be the mid-section of a projectile point. However, not enough of a section exists to be sure of a type. The other is the basal section of a preform (TTU-A557; see Fig. 45b) with a slightly concave base that exhibits some grinding of the lateral edges. It was apparently broken during the thinning process and raay have been intended as a projectile point. All of the scrapers are of mediura light (N6) to raedium dark (N4) gray Edwards Plateau chert. They contain parts of outer cortex and were apparently struck off a nodule as decortification flakes. One specimen (TTU-A430; see Fig. 46b) is a relatively thick, narrow side scraper with steep retouch on all sides. Heavy damage flakes were reraoved from sections of both sides with the raost damage being on the right distal side. At this juncture, the scraper was broken which may have been the result of a manufacturing error or from usage. Another side scraper TTU-A665, TTU-A666) was made from a long (L60; W27), variably thick (T3-10) flake and exhibits steep retouch along half of the proxiraal left edge with sorae associated micro-wear damage. This specimen was found broken at the mid-point of the utilized edge, apparently from usage. Two other unifacial, blade-like flakes may also be provisionally considered as scrapers. One specimen (TUU-A607) displays very steep retouch and damage scars along one side and edge. It was apparently broken during use, with both halves being recovered. The other specimen (TTU-A606) shows alternate edge damage along one lateral margin from usage. It had also been broken in half. A total of 168 flakes and pieces of debitage were recovered from this feature. All were of Edwards Plateau chert except for four pieces of translucent, olive black (5Y2/1) obsidian. The Edwards Plateau chert ranged both in shade and color. The ranges are: yellowish gray (5Y8/1)-2 speciraens; light olive gray (5Y6/1)~31 speciraens; olive gray (5Y4/1)-35 specimens; olive black (5Y2/1)-44 specimens; medium dark gray (N4)-41 specimens; dark gray (N3)-7 speciraens; and grayish black (N2)-4 specimens. Of the total number of flakes and debitage, 15 are biface thinning flakes, 133 are edge retouch (MD5-10) or sharpening flakes, and 12 are utilized flakes. Three categories of edge daraage were observed on the utilized flakes: (1) fine, micro-wear flake scars from usage-3 specimens; (2) micro-wear flake daraage that resulted in a steep edge angle (> 45 )-5 speciraens; and (3) fine, unifacial pressure retouch and raicrowear damage that resulted in steep edge angle (> 45 )-4 specimens. The latter two categories indicate that these specimens were used as scraping tools although the work activity was probably of a fine, finishing nature. This is suggested by both the size of the flakes and the amount of edge utilized. For example, one specimen (TTU-A667) measures L15 x Wll x Tl, yet exhibits a shallow scallop on the left distal raargin from steep angle retouch and micro-wear damage. Two others (TTU-A653 and TTU-A559), characterized by small size and relatively thick concavo-convex cross-section, are shown in Figures 47c and 47d, respectively. Another similar flake (TTU-A558; see Fig. 47b) shows only slight microwear damage. Three metate fragments were also recovered. Two fragments that fit together (TTU-A518) are made of a micaceous sandstone. The other (TTU-A608) is composed of fine-grained sandstone and exhibits one partially smooth, flat side (base?). The other side is smooth and slightly concave and also shows indications of a slight, reddish stain which may be a result of grinding hematite. Mostly sub-angular, burned silicified caliche (35 pieces) were recovered and range in size from 10 to 100 ram (MD). A total of 16 bison (Bison bison) are represented in this feature. This is based on a cluster of skulls that were found in Blocks A and A . Only five of these now exist in the collections. At least one juvenile individual, probably a four year old, is included. This is indicated by one smaller skull in Block A and the lack of fused epiphyses on such bones as the calcaneum, raetacarpal, and feraur. The raajority of post-cranial elements are located in Blocks B and C. Of these, only parts of the juvenile and three other adults are present. This is based on a count of phalanges, calcanei, metacarpals, pelves, ulnae, and premaxillae which yield a count of 4,0 individuals. Except for most of the distal lirab eleraents, all of the bone material has been heavily broken up and processed. Of the five skulls that remain, all have had the nasals or maxillae detached while several have portions of the horn cores and various parts of the skull missing. Only one still contains an intact basiosphenoid area. Although all of these specimens have undergone sorae degree of damage while in storage, this type of breakage pattern is, for the most part, corroborated by the field sketches (Figs. 44, 49)' Only a few mandibular fragments were found. One piece of a coronoid process (TTU-A679; see Fig. 48b), however, displays several cut lines. probably from previous muscle detachment during the initial butchering process. Several of the post-cranial elements also exhibit characteristic breakage patterns. Selected eleraents are discussed below. Vertebrae At least 11 specimens are represented. All, except for one small thoracic, lack or show unfused epiphyses (indicating that most of the aniraals represented are less than seven years old). The lurabars and thoracics have had either part, or all, of the spinous process snapped off. One cervical vertebra is complete. Several have also had their transverse processes chopped off and are represented by only portions of the centrum. Two vertebrae will show distinctive depressions as a result of blows with a pointed instrument. One, a small thoracic, (TTU-A528) displays repeated, linear blow raarks just under the left transverse process on the centrum; and the other, a lurabar, (TTU-A663) shows one relatively large (MDIO) blow raark just at the posterior base of the spine on the left side. Several vertebrae with raissing epiphysial plates also exhibit edge crushing and damage along the anterior and posterior margins of the centrum. This is most evident in specimens TTU-A538, TTU-A530, TTU-A581 and TTU-A492, and is probably the result of marrow and/or bone grease extraction activities. Only two partial, intact thoracic spines were recovered. One (TTU-A615) displays a series of longitudinal cut raarks approxiraately 75 mra up frora the base on the left side. The rest (12 speciraens) are spinal fragments ranging in size from 35 to 120 mm (MD). Rlbs Approximately 100 fragments are represented. Only four pieces are over 130 mm in length with the remainder being largely split shaft fragments measuring between 250 30 and 100 mm in length. Several pieces display crushed or concave edge fractures as a result of intentional pounding and breakage. Scapulae Only three proximal portions of the glenoid fossa, plus a few blade fragments are present. All three proximal segments were broken from the rest of the scapula approximately 140 mm from the glenoid cavity. Humeri Only two are definitely represented. One is a large, right proximal segraent (TTU-A594) from Block A, with portions of the lateral and raedial tuberosities crushed or chopped away. The other is a left distal shaft and condyle segraent (TTU-A549) that exhibits a very well-forraed spiral break. At the lowest point of the spiral break on the raedial side, the shaft was additionally broken open for a distance of 50 mm. This was undoubtedly for the extraction of the marrow content since much of the cancellous core material has been removed. The lateral interior side (opposite the break) exhibits a distinctive \"smoothing\" or polishing along the length of the medial breakage from the scraping out of the cancellous raaterial. One other shaft fragment (TTU-A642) shows modification in the forra of crushing and flaking along one raargin. Ulnae Seven speciraens are represented. Six of the seven have had their shaft broken off below the coronoid process. Three speciraens (TTU-A552, TTU-A663, TTU-A22436) display a serai-scalloped edge where their olecranon was chopped off by repeated blows. Radii At least three speciraens are represented by three proximal and two distal segments. Of the three proxiraal portions, two exhibit spiral breakage of the shaft just below the articulating surface; while the third piece is a right medial fragment split longitudinally. Metacarpals At least six specimens are represented. Three show no breakage. Fragments consist of two distal condyles, two proximal ends, and the distal half of one speciraen. The latter (TTU-A659) had been broken at raid-diaphysis resulting in a very angular, jagged spiral break. Sorae of the inner cancellous bone was also removed. Pelves Of the seven halves represented, only one (TTU-A592), from Block A, is whole although portions of the iliac and ischial margins have been chopped away leaving the edge scalloped in some areas. One other half (TTU-A591), broken in two parts, shows the same type of breakage as do several other recovered fragments (TTU-A505, TTU-A504, TTU-A472). Four of the pelvic halves are presented by the acetabular segment with the ischial, pubic, and iliac portions having been chopped or broken.A fifth specimen (TTU-A593) still has the pubic bone attached to the acetabulura. Two of the acetabular segments (TTU-A507, TTU-A622) retain evidence of the original butchering process in the forra of raultiple blow raarks to the internal wall of the acetabulum. This raay have been an attempt at detaching the femur by breaking in from the opposite side and cutting the cotyloid, transverse acetabular, and round ligaraents which bind the femur to the acetabulura.FemoraOnly a few fragments from the proximal and distal shaft are represented. One feraur head fragment (TTU-A650) displays multiple puncture of blow raarks over the cortical and cancellous surface. It also appears to be slightly charred.",

It appears to fit the anterior edge and, as such, was probably the last piece of shaft to be broken off before this tibia segraent was discarded.MetatarsalsOnly four speciraens are represented. One is whole and the others consist of two distal and one proximal segment. One distal segment (TTU-A620) and the proxiraal(TTU-A593) segment have had portions of the cancellous bone removed. In addition, over 50 pieces of bison bone scrap and 92 fragments of long bone shaft were recovered. The shaft fragments range in size frora 30 to 90 mm (MD), but the majority average about 50 mra (MD). Most display some sort of crushing or flaking of their raargins as a result of being detached frora their forraer elements. The nuraerous pieces of bone shaft debitage explains the lack of complete long bones represented in this feature. Two canids are also represented in this feature. The proximal half of a coyote (Canis latrans) tibia was recovered, and during the cleaning and preservation stage, articularing phalanges (TTU-A786) of a coyote foot were recovered from the braincase of one of the bison skulls (TTU-A597) from this feature. The most numerous canid remains recovered are those of a small wolf (Canis lupus) found concentrated in the central portion of Block A-and the northern portion of Block B. At least two individuals are represented on the basis of two axis vertebrae, although no other elements are duplicated. One thoracic vertebra (TTU-A675) shows a relatively thick, abnormal bone growth along the bottora of the centrura, indicating a pathologic, and probable arthritic, condition.253Although most of the bone eleraents are still intact, a few exhibit signs of butchering. One ulna (TTU-A539) has had its shaft below the coronoid process and olecranon broken off. Two halves of a radius (TTU-A638, TTU-A639), found adjacent to each other in Block A , were separated by a single blow to the posterior shaft sorae 55 ram below the proximal end. A recovered tibia had also been broken at raid-diaphysis. The proximal half (TTU-A671) has a very distinctive blow mark depression on the medial side within the sulcus muscularis.One finished bone tool, an awl (TTU-A561; seeFig. 47a), fashioned from the split section of raaramal rib was recovered in Block A-. Its tip had apparently been'broken during use, and the tool discarded.

Hearth stones are noticably lacking, although one very large caliche cobble (now missing) had apparently been placed on top of the radius in the center of the hearth(Figs. 33, 44). The significance of this is not known; however, it seems likely that the cobble had prior use as an anvil.The bison remains are represented by at least two individuals based on a count of five first phalanges. Most of the elements recovered were lower limb bones, in addition to a few ribs, skull and pelvis fragments, shaft segments, and one mandible. The raandible (TTU-A703) has had its coronoid process (TTU-A702) snapped off, although both segments were found together. Most of the long bone shaft pieces are from a tibia or femur and have had portions of the cancellous bone reraoved, resulting in polished, interior sections. Many of these also show secondary edge daraage, probably a result of repeated pounding and breakage. Two large broken ribs were recovered, although raost (13 speciraens) of the rib elements are very fragmentary, measuring between 30 and 120 mm (MD). One ischial fragment (TTU-A714) has had its distal and pubic margins chopped away. Most of the fragmented and several whole eleraents also display what appear to be sraall burn marks and a slight, characteristic dull finish (not related to the preservative) that may be a result of heat-treatraent.

DISCUSSION: This feature is scattered throughout Blocks A , A, and B. The lithics consist of one tiny (MD7) resharpening/ retouch flake of pale (5R6/2) to moderate (5R5/4) red colored chert, and a small broken flake scraper made of a translucent grayish red (10R4/2) chert. Both are presumed to be of heat-treated Edwards Plateau chert. The flake scraper (TTU-A763; see Fig. 48a) displays prominent unifacial retouch along the right lateral border, while the left margin exhibits alternate, unifacial retouch of a lesser degree. Ten pieces of angular to rounded bumed, silicified caliche recovered. They range in size from 12 to 50 rara (MD) and were distributed throughout the blocks. Remains of Bison bison are represented by a carpal, a fragmented first phalange and raetapodial, and a scapula blade. The latter (TTU-A744) has several grooved marks along one edge, probably from carnivore gnawing. Several pieces of bone scrap and rib fragments were also recovered. Most of these appear to be slightly charred. EQUIVALENT: Correlates stratigraphically with feature KA8-10. zone littered with burned caliche and some lithics and burned bone. ILLUSTRATION: Horizontal placement of mapped items on file at The Museum of Texas Tech University. DISCUSSION: The majority of this feature consists of a randora scatter of burned silicified caliche throughout Blocks A., , A, B, and C. A total of 53 angular to rounded pieces were recovered, ranging in size frora 12 to 80 mm (MD) with most between 20 and 40 mm in mean diameter. The other lithic material consists of one side scraper found in Block C, and 14 flakes and pieces of debitage scattered throughout all of the blocks. The scraper (TTU-A781; see Fig. 52) was made from a rectangular, blade-like flake and has been unifacially retouched along both lateral margins. Both edges also show some micro-wear damage. The color mottles between yellowish gray (5Y8/1) and bluish white (5B9/1); however, this is believed to be just the exterior color of a well-patinated, darker colored Edwards Plateau chert. This is based on several flakes of Edwards Plateau chert that show the various stages of patination from a grayish brown (5YR3/2) to the lighter, whitish colors. Thirteen of the fourteen flakes and pieces of debitage are of this type; and one tiny (MD9) piece of debitage is of Tecovas chert. One large flake (TTU-A767) appears to have been heat-treated and may be of local origin from the Edwards Formation. The only faunal remains consist of one badly weathered lunar of Bison bison and seven piece of burned scrap. EQUIVALENT: Correlates stratigraphically with feature KA8-12. placement of raapped iteras on file at The Museum of Texas Tech University.

A broken, blade-like flake (TTU-A23894) raade of olive gray (5Y4/1) Edwards Plateau chert was also recovered frora near the bottora of the substratura. The flake show sorae longitudinal pressure flaking on the dorsal surface, although there are no signs of use of implement raanufacture. The faunal reraains consist of first and second phalanges of horse (Equus caballus) found approximately 70 cm apart, several small (MD < 60) fragments of rib and bone shaft, and a rodent incisor. Both phalanges of the horse produce a good \"fit\" and were probably from the sarae individual.

Metal items consist of a carriage bolt (Ll and 9/16 inches; mk inch) and part of a hinge (TTU-A23890) recovered from Block I. One piece of light olive gray (5Y6/1) DISCUSSION: debitage, possible of petrified wood, and a broken bifacial tool (TTU-A23876) of medium dark gray (N4) Edwards Plateau chert were recovered. The unbroken edge of the tool fragment exhibits some alternate retouch and use damage of varying steepness. It raay have been used as either a scraper or a knife. Over 30 pieces of charcoal (average MD18), one piece of burned bone, and sorae ash were uncovered in a roughly rectangular area (.75 x .50 ra) in the northwest corner of Block J. Except for two small flecks (TTU-A23871), raost of the charcoal (TTU-A23689) appears to be of a poor quality, raan-raade variety. It is very light and porous, and where freshly broken, has a vitreous luster. One piece of this material was placed over a Bunsen burner and fired. It attained a quick, hot temperature but only by applying constant air pressure.

ILLUSTRATION: Horizontal placement of mapped items on file at The Museum of Texas Tech University. represented in Blocks K and I (Block J not excavated past this level). Four small bumed silicified caliche pebbles were recovered in Block K along with five pieces of burned bone and several flecks of charcoal. Remains of Bison bison consist of a tarsal, calcaneum, fragments of a raandible, huraerus, tibia, and ulna. About twenty rib fragraents (MD65-20) were also recovered. The only non-bison material found was a premolar and vertebra fragment of a pronghorn antelope (Antilocapra americana). Correlates stratigraphically with features GA8zone containing burned caliche, bison, antelope, pottery, and lithic debitage. ILLUSTRATION: Horizontal placement of mapped iteras on file at The Museum of Texas Tech University. DISCUSSION: One small (MD12) piece of translucent grayish black (N2) obsidian was recovered, along with one piece of thick (TIO), brush decorated ware (TTU-A23893). This potsherd is identical to those recovered in feature GA8-4. Three large (MD55) and four smaller (MD25) angular pieces of burned silicif ied caliche were also found. The faunal material is represented mostly by remains of Bison bison. They include a juvenile femur head epiphysis, one dentary symphysis, a broken raolar, three incisors, a carpal, and a third phalange, in addition to ten pieces of bone scrap. Three pieces of pronghorn antelope (Antilocapra americana) pelvis were also recovered. Correlates stratigraphically and typologically (as based on the brush ware sherd) with feature GA8-4hearth area containing bone scrap, burned caliche, charcoal, bumed bone, and lithic material. DISCUSSION: This feature is restricted to a small area in the northeast corner:of Block K. The lithics consist of two flakes made of slightly translucent, olive gray (5Y4/1) and olive black (5Y2/1) to dark yellowish brown (10YR4/1) Edwards Plateau chert. One large (MD33), concavo-convex, utilized flake (TTU-A23789) appears to have been slightly heat-treated and was repeatedly broken along three margins. Two of the broken edges were recovered and glued back into place. One raargin (left lateral) shows extensive, unifacial wear daraage along the ventral surface. Edge damage is considerable and has produced a steepangled margin. The opposite (right lateral) edge also shows sorae use scars on the dorsal surface, but with a lesser degree of edge daraage. The flake was probably broken from use during heavy scraping activity and discarded. Approxiraately five grams of charcoal and 29 pieces of angular burned, silicified caliche ranging in size from 5 to 50 mm (MD) were recovered. Several of these pieces are heat fractured spalls which display very sharp, angular breaks that give an appearance of culturally modified flakes. Three of these (TTU-A418, TTU-A23895) were previously catalogued as debitage. Faunal remains consist of several pieces of burned bone fragments and unburned bone scrap. The proxiraal segment of a Bison bison raetatarsal was also recovered. Generally, the bumed bone consisted of shaft debris, while the unburned fragments, mostly small (MD60), were pieces of rib. EQUIVALENT: Correlates directly with and is a part of the double hearth feature LLP FA8-6, and is probably associated with feature LLP FA8zone containing burned caliche, bone scrap, and bison remains. ILLUSTRATION: Horizontal placement of mapped iteras in Figure 54. DISCUSSION: Approximately 150 pieces of burned, raostly silicified caliche was recovered, priraarily from Block K. They are, for the most part, very angular and range in size frora 5 to 75 mm (MD). One small, circular pile of burned caliche and bone was found near and at the same level as the hearth of feature KA8-5 in Block K. The lack of ash and/or charcoal from this pile suggests that it is not a separate smaller hearth but probably raaterial taken out of the larger one. One small, broken flake of olive gray (5Y4/1) Edwards Plateau chert was found in Block I. All of the faunal raaterial recovered is that of Bison bison which was scattered randoraly throughout Blocks K and I. The eleraents include vertebral, raandibular, pelvic, raetacarpal, and shaft fragraents, in addition to a cubo-navicular and calcaneum. One juvenile feraur segment of the trochanger raajor (TTU-A23797) exhibits sorae intentional pounding and reraoval of the outer cortex along the anterior margin. Removal of the cancellous interior is also concordant with this breakage. Upper part of this feature is probably an occupational surface with the uppermost level of the hearth in feature KA8-5. Since this hearth is actually a double, super-imposed hearth (FA8-6, LLP), the lower material coming out of this (KA8-6) occupational zone may actually EQUIVALENT:be part of a living surface associated with the second, lower hearth level(Fig. 18). It may also correlate with features GA8-7 and LLP FA8-4. placement of mapped items of file at The Museum of Texas Tech University. DISCUSSION: A very small feature restricted to Block K(Fig. 18).Items recovered include: ten pieces of sub-rounded, burned caliche; one broken resharpening/retouch flake of Tecovas chert; one piece of burned bone; and the fragmented portions of a mandible, vertebra, and metapodial of Bison bison.

DISCUSSION: The artifact remains frora this feature are sparse, but scattered throughout the top of substratura 4C. Lithics recovered consist of one broken flake of yellowish (5Y8/1) to light (N8) gray chert, one light olive gray (5Y6/1) flake, and six olive gray (5Y4/1) flakes (TTU-A23777) that were found in a pile in the western corner of Block K (Fig. 17). Ml but the forraer are of Edwards Plateau chert. Other items found were one piece of bone scrap, a radius fragment of Bison bison, two flecks of charcoal, and two pieces of burned silicified caliche. One of these pieces (TTU-A23852) is a roughly ovoid-shaped fragment of a mano and displays a smooth surface polish on side and edge. EQUIVALENT: Correlates stratigraphically with feature GA8-10. 264 zone consisting of lithics, bone scrap, and burned caliche. ILLUSTRATION: Mapped placement of individual iteras on file at The Museum of Texas Tech Universtiy. DISCUSSION: The feature material is scattered throughout the raiddle zone of this unit. Lithics consist of five flakes, three of which are utilized. One flake (TTU-A23822) displays minute, but steep, micro-wear damage along one raargin and is composed of light brownish (5YR6/1) to brownish (5YR4/1) gray Edwards Plateau chert. Another flake (TTU-A23832) is made of black (Nl), non-translucent chert (?) and exhibits a similar damage along one edge. The other is a broad (L32; W38) hinge fractured flake (TTU-A23843) of silicified caliche. It exhibits a distinctive platforra and bulb of percussion and shows some retouch along the left lateral edge in addition to some heavy edge daraage along the distal raargin. The other two non-utilized flakes are of a slightly translucent brownish gray (5YR4/1) Edwards Plateau chert. Other material recovered includes eight pieces of burned silicified caliche and a few fragments of identified bone. EQUIVALENT: None postulated at this time. zone consisting of burned caliche andlithics. ILLUSTRATION: Mapped placement of iteras on file at The Museum of Texas Tech University. DISCUSSION: This feature is very sparse. The only items recovered were ten pieces of burned caliche and two flakes of yellowish (5Y8/1) to light olive (5Y6/1) gray Edwards Plateau chert. EQUIVALENT: Correlates stratigraphically with feature GA8-11. placment of mapped items in Figure 55. DISCUSSION: The most prominent aspect of this feature is the metal items found primarily in Block Q. One squashed, but mostly whole, tin can (TTU-A22207) and 63 fragments of at least one other can were recovered. Most of these fragments were originally in larger pieces (Fig. 55) but have since deteriorated while in the collections. One circular piece of metal (TTU-A22308) found in the northeast corner of Block Q exhibits a very distinctive, yet irregular margin and raay have been an opened lid to one of these cans. It is approximately the same dimension and thickness as the bottom still attached to TTU-A22308. Portions of at least five square nails were also found and constitute the only other raetal iteras recovered. The lithics consist only of one small piece of burned caliche and one tiny (MDIO), broken bladlet (?) (TTU-A22212) of olive gray (5Y4/1) Edwards Plateau chert. The only faunal remains identifiable consist of a portion of a coyote (Canis latrans) jaw (TTU-A22200) found in Block A. The rest of the bone raaterial is coraposed of approximately 30 pieces of bone scrap, and rib and shaft fragments frora a large raaramal. Two pieces of bone scrap (TTU-A22206) were calcined. Similar metal items have come out of feature GA8-1zone containing burned caliche, bison, antelope, and rabbit. ILLUSTRATION: Horizontal placement of raapped items in Figure 56. DISCUSSION: The only lithic items consist of three pieces of bumed caliche. The numerous faunal elements are of pronghorn antelope (Antilocapra americana), although it appears that only one individual is represented. The elements include ribs and vertebrae, in addition to parts of a humerus and radius. Both the ribs and vertebrae (cervical and thoracic eleraents) were found articulated in Block P and appear to represent a single discarded butchering unit. The spinous process of the thoracic vertebrae all exhibit some degree of breakage, as do several of the ribs which were all recovered along the right half of the vertebral column(Fig. 56). Both the humerus and radius also display signs of butchering and food processing raarks. The distal humerus segment (TTU-A22248) exhibits several cut marks along the lower medial and anterior shaft, in addition to a spiral fracture at mid-diaphysis and removal of the interior cancellous bone for the marrow content. The radius (TTU-A22215, TTU-A22216), which consists of the proximal end and partial shaft, was found in two pieces. Both pieces fit, and when placed together, show where a blow to the posterior shaft just below the proximal end had caused the sraaller piece (TTU-A22216) to break away. All of the cancellous bone had also been removed leaving a polished interior surface.Most of the material of Bison bison consists ofteeth and maxillary fragments and a broken up metatarsal.One second phalange and a few rib fragments were also recovered. Several large pieces of the metatarsal were scattered throughout both blocks; however, several pieces of shaft, bone scrap, and molar fragments werefound in a small concentrated area in Block A. The right tibia of a cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus sp.zone with miscellaneous camp debris. ILLUSTRATION: Horizontal placement of mapped items in Figure 57. DISCZUSSION: This feature consists mainly of a small, shallow camp hearth and a few pieces of broken bison bone. The hearth apparently contained sorae ash, charcoal, and a few pieces of burned caliche (Fig. 34). There are no records of any other iteras being recovered. Besides a few pieces of burned caliche, the only lithic iteras found were a fragment of ground raicaceous sandstone (raano?) (TTU-A22305), and a thick, roughly pyramidshaped, utilized flake (TTU-A22310; Fig. 59) in Block Q. The flake is made of variably shaded light gray (N7) Edwards Plateau chert and displays steep, damage flake scaring along the broad, distal end and a scalloped, right lateral edge. Flake scars are heaviest along the dorsal raargin, although sorae raicro-wear damage does occur along the ventral surface at the distal end. Some intentional retouch has taken place along the former striking platform. Two small parallel flakes had been taken off, forming a graver-like projection that was subsequently broken, perhaps during use. The faunal elements are entirely of Bison bison and represent no more than one animal. A broken metacarpal and tibia were found together near the hearth. The distal tibia segment (TTU-A22298) exhibits a distinctive spiral fracture. All of the interior cancellous bone was removed. Several parts of a scapula and shaft debris, in addition to a carpal, sesamoid, and first phalange, were recovered from both blocks. One concentrated area in Block Q yielded over 50 small (MD50) fragments of shaft, rib, teeth, and other scrap. EQUIVALENT: None postulated at this time. zone containing bumed caliche, charcoal, lithics, bison, and non-bison faunal remains. ILLUSTRATION: Horizontal placement of mapped items in Figure 58. DISCUSSION: This feature consists of several activity areas scattered throughout both blocks. The lithics, however, appear to have no particular concentration and represent raostly broken, discarded raaterial. One worked decortification flake (TTU-A22237; see Fig. 60) of dark gray (N3) to light olive gray (5Y6/1) Edwards Plateau chert shows considerable retouch and edge damage along two raargins with one end forming a slight, pointed projection. This end o has been retouched to an approxiraate angle of 45 and exhibits sorae raicro-flake scaring and edge crushing. Its function may have been as a scraping implement although this is not certain since virtually all of the former edge had been re-worked in an attempt to either resharpen the tool or modify it. Apparently this was unsuccessful, and the implement discarded. A broken biface (TTU-A22294, TTU-A22295; see Fig. 61) of light (N7) to light olive (5Y6/1) gray [with yellowish gray (5Y8/1) mottling] Edwards Plateau chert was found near the Block P-Q border of Block P in two pieces. The biface (blank?) fragment had been broken twice during an attempt at reducing the edge. The margins are serrate and irregular, except one part along the apex which shows some additional fine retouch and straightening. It may have also functioned as a cutting tool. A broken flake side scraper (TTU-A22374; see Fig. 62) made of an unidentified grayish (10YR7/4) to dark yellowish (10YR6/6) orange chert was recovered from Block Q. The working edge exhibits considerable wear damage. One broad, and relatively large, flake had been taken off of each side of the tool which may have been used as finger \"grips\" since this chert type has an exceedingly fine, cryptocrystalline composition and is very smooth to the touch. If this assumption is correct, these flaked grips would form a perfect \"fit\" for a right-handed worker. Two pieces of debitage, one of Morrison quartzite and the other of light gray (N7) Edwards Plateau chert, in addition to one flake of an unidentified light gray (N7) orthoquartzite, were also recovered. About sixty pieces of burned caliche were found. They range in size from 5 to 75 ram (MD) with the average at 40 mra (MD). Most are very thin, angular, platey fragments and are concordantly distributed throughout the blocks within areas of bone concentration. Although no hearths were recorded for this feature zone, the presence of charcoal and these angular, very charred pieces of caliche, indicates that one was nearby. The raost numerous faunal remains are those of Bison bison. At least three individuals, one of which was a juvenile, are represented. This is based on a count and size difference of five distal tibia segments. Many of the mapped bones from this feature are located within fairly distinct concentrated areas. The processing nature of these activity areas is suggested by the condition of the recovered elements. Except for several tarsals and phalanges, none of the bones recovered are whole, and most are in very fragmentary condition. This is particularly true of the vertebrae (ten specimens), ribs, and a few skull and pelvic parts. All of the long bones, including metapodials, have had their diaphyses broken up and are represented only by the distal or proximal segments. This situation explains the high number of shaft fragments (138) and pieces of bone scrap (approximately 175) recovered. Twelve of these are calcined. The other bon-bison bones recovered are also fragraentary and represented by only a few eleraents. They include box turtle (Terrapene sp.), coyote (Canis latrans), pronghorn antelope (Antilocapra americana), and modern horse (Equus caballus). The latter is represented by one upper molar. EQUIVALENT: None postulated at this time. FEATURE: GA7-5 SUBSTRATUM: 5A/5A soil DESCRIPTION: Camp hearth and associated occupational floor. ILLUSTRATION: Horizontal placement of mapped items (from upper hearth zone only) in Figure 63.

                "text": "Within the hearth area, the artifacts are distributed within one of two concentrations. It is not known if this raay represent two adjacent, but separate, upper level hearths, or one relatively large hearth subsequently disturbed. Whatever the original configurations, most of the material recovered within the hearth area was not burned or charred, indicating that the hearth had been at least partially exhumed after its initial use and filled with refuse. All of the lithics recovered come from within the hearth. They include one fragment of ground stone, a broken side scraper, two utilized flakes, and five small flakes of slightly translucent mediura (N5) to dark (N3) gray Edwards Plateau chert. The ground stone fragment (TTU-A22285) is linear, uniformly thick (TIO) and has been ground smooth on only one surface. It is composed of a very fine-grained sandstone and may have been part of a grinding slab (metatae). The side scraper (TTU-A22373; see Fig. 65) is of a moderate red (5R4/6) to yellowish gray (5Y8/1) mottled Alibates chert and exhibits steep damage scaring along both lateral edges in addition to a finer, alternate, micro-wear damage along the unbroken end. One utilized flake (TTU-A22296) is of translucent grayish black (N2) obsidian. It had originally been struck from a biface or core as a narrow (L25; W12) thinning flake and displays steep, micro-wear, flake damage along the right lateral dorsal margin. The other utilized flake (TTU-A22341) is of a pale red (10R6/1) to pinkish gray (5Y8/1) silicified caliche. It has been broken along three raargins and shows slight, unifacial micro-wear flake scaring along the one intact margin and one broken end. The majority of recovered bone elements are those of Bison bison. At least three individuals are represented by a count of astragalii (six) and calcanei (five) 272 The presence of a distal radius epiphysis and missing olecranon caput on one ulna indicates that one individual was a four year old juvenile. The most nuraerous elements are the vertebrae (26) and rear distal limb bones. Almost all of the cervical vertebrae (six) are intact; however, all of the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae (18) have had at least parts of their spinous and transverse processes broken off. Many have also had portions of the centrum chopped away. At least four thoracics still show distinctive blow raark daraage. Only one thoracic spine was recovered. All of the long bones, including raetapodials, have had their shafts broken up and are represented only by the distal or proxiraal segments. Several exhibit blow mark irapressions within the reraaining cancellous bone interiors. One proxiraal radius segment (TTU-A22359) has had a longitudinal section broken out of the posterior shaft, and virtually all of the interior cancellous bone reraoved. Burned and unbumed bone shaft fragments are relatively numerous (> 200 pieces). Many of the fragments exhibit a combination of well formed spiral edge fractures, reraoval of cancellous raaterial, and secondary edge crushing and flaking. The bison elements represented by a small number of fragments are ribs, pelves, and skull parts (mostly mandiblary and maxillary). One left pelvic segment (TTU-A22276) has had portions of the iliura, ischium, and pubis chopped off, in addition to multiple blow raarks to the internal wall of the acetabulum. This has resulted in a hole approximately 28 ram in diameter, and was evidently an attempt at detaching the femur by cutting the binding ligaments. The same type of butchering pattern is seen in specimens TTU-A507 and TTU-A622 of feature GA8-7. Mandibular fragments are represented mostly by portions of the dentary symphysis and ascending ramus. Other faunal remains are of wolf (Canis lupus), coyote (Canis latrans), box turtle (Terrapene sp.), and raud turtle (Kinosternum flavescens).",

These should yield a good time bracket for both hearth levels, in addition to providing a more modern check on the previous date. Samples of charcoal have also been sent to the U.S.D.A. Forest Service Products Laboratory in Wisconsin for identification of the wood used. EQUIVALENT: Probably associated with feature GA7-6. However, since vertical artifact ranges for that feature are so variable, it is not known if they would correlate to either hearth level in GA7-5, or be part of a zone containing lithics, bison, and nonbison remains. ILLUSTRATION: Horizontal placement of raapped items, mostly the lithics, on file at The Museum of Texas Tech University. DISCUSSION: This feature is restricted to Block Q and those items recovered from outside the hearth of feature GA7-5 and below its uppermost occupational level in Block P. The lithics consist of a large chopper, a core, three utilized flakes, a tiny flake scraper, and one small flake of an unidentified translucent chalcedony. The chopper (TTU-A22408; see Fig. 64) was made from a very large (L130; W90), thick (T27) flake of silicified caliche It ranges in color from pale red (10R6/2) to grayish, orange pink (10R8/2), and displays some edge damage 274 along the proximal, right lateral, and distal margins. The right lateral margin also exhibits some charring (and residues?) along approximately 5 mm of the edge on both sides. The core (TTU-A22401) is made of the same silicified caliche as the chopper. It is roughly triangular in outline (L75; W53) with a relatively, high-backed dorsal apex (T35) and slightly convex ventral surface. Four surface areas are relatively clean and smooth where former flakes had been reraoved. This particular type of silicified caliche shows unusually good characteristics for knapping. Two utilized flakes of Edwards Plateau chert exhibit fine, but steep, micro-wear daraage. One is a small (L16; W19), triangular mediura gray (N5) to light bluish gray (5B7/1) flake (TTU-A22407) with damage flake scaring along both lateral edges. The left distal end also flares to a tiny graver-like projection. The other is a broken blade-like flake (TTU-A22422) of light (N7) to light olive (5Y6/1) gray color with damage flake scaring along the left proximal edge. One other boat-shaped utilized flake (TTU-A22421; see Fig. 66) of raedium light gray (N6) Edwards Plateau chert exhibits daraage flake scaring along the entire, unbroken lateral margin. The distal end of this margin displays very steep (> 45 ) microwear damage and possible retouch of the dorsal side only, while the rest of the utilized raargin shows alternate micro-wear damage resulting in a slightly serrated edge.",

                "text": "Elements of Bison bison make up most of the recovered faunal raaterial. At least two animals are present, based on a count of five (three right; two left) second phalanges and three metacarpals. One individual was a juvenile, probably four years old, as indicated by one small calcaneum (TTU-A22415) missing its distal epiphysis. Most of the recovered elements, however, are of an older, adult individual. Both the amount and type of bone breakage is very similar to that of feature GA7-5. Of the eight vertebrae present, two cervicals show alraost no daraage, one shows some damage to its transverse processes, and four thoracics and one lumbar show extensive damage to or removal of their dorsal and transverse processes and centrum. All of the long bones, including raetapodials, have had their shafts broken up and are represented by distal and proximal segraents. One distal humerus fragment (TTU-A22404) is calcined. A metacarpal (TTU-A22412)found in two separate halves shows where multiple blows to the posterior shaft section has resulted in detachment of the proximal end with a partial spiral fracture. A medial section of shaft that articulates with both broken halves was found \"depressed\" into the marrow cavity of the shaft frora the distal segraent. This probably represents the last blow before both ends of the raetacarpal were separated. The anterior shaft also exhibits several cut raarks, probably frora skinning. Over 90 fragments of long bone shaft were recovered and range in size between 10 and 130 mm (MD). Many display addi-tional crushing and flaking along their edges as well as the removal of interior cancellous bone. All of the pelvic and scapula elements are very broken up and represented almost entirely by their articular surfaces. One acetabular fragment (TTU-A22364) still retains part of a blow mark (hole) to the incissura acetabuli. A 276 mandibular body fragment (TTU-A22364) had the length of its interior margin chopped off exposing the dental batteries. Only 17 fragments of rib, ranging in size from 40 to 170 mm, were recovered. Non-bison remains are represented by wolf (Canis lupus), coyote (Canis latrans), and one unidentified rodent phalange. EQUIVALENT: Possibly correlated to feature GA7-5 as an associated occupational floor. However, clear association cannot be established because of variable vertical plot ranges and lack of detailed records on each hearth level of feature GA7-5. Two lithic specimens from Block P, the chopper (TTU-A22408) and utilized flake (TTU-A22407), come out at the sarae vertical level as the lowerraost hearth level in feature GA7-5, and may be associated with the lower hearth. Future testing of Area 7 raay determine exactly how many occupational horizons are located with the lower part of substratum 5A and help to indicate whether features GA7-6 and GA7-5 are, indeed, the same. FEATURE: GA7-7 SUBSTRATUM: 4C soil (uppermost) DESCRIPTION: Occupational zone containing burned caliche and bison bone. ILLUSTRATION: Horizontal placement of mapped items on file at The Museum of Texas Tech University. DISCUSSION: Cultural material is sparse within this feature. Only one piece of angular to sub-rounded, burned silicified caliche still remains in the collection. Several pieces and a chert flake (TTU 60-47-256) are missing. The bones recovered were those of Bison bison and are representive of only one juvenile individual. The elements includean astragalus, patella, cubonavicular, first phalange, calcaneum (without epiphysial caput) and distal tibia epiphysis, One rib fragment and ten pieces of long bone shaft debris were also found. Most of the shaft fragments display sharp longitudinal or spiral-like fracturing. One tibia shaft fragment (TTU-A22425) shows several negative flake scars along one edge. EQUIVALENT: May correlate with Area 8 features KA8-10 and GA8-10. More field testing is needed to determine if the cultural zone in the uppermost part of substratum 4C can be precisely correlated, both stratigraphically and spatially, between Areas 7 and 8. The two features are tentatively considered as equivalent. vertical placeraent in Figure 32. DISCUSSION: This feature horizon is restricted to Block Q and consists solely of one heavily patinated flake (TTU-A22431) of brownish gray (5YR4/1) Edwards Plateau chert, although a few items frora this horizon are raissing from the collections. Feature designation was assigned, however, because of cultural horizons located within the same stratigraphic zone in Area 8. EQUIVALENT: Probably correlates with features KA8-12 and GA8-, and possibly butchered remains of extinct bison and pronghorn antelope. ILLUSTRATION: Horizontal placement of mapped items in Figure 80. associated with this feature. The majority of recovered faunal elements are those of pronghorn antelope (Antilocapra americana). Most are concentrated within the southeast corner of Block G. Although some post-excavation damage has occurred to the elements, their distribution and original breakage pattern would suggest that this may be the fringe area of a butchering locale. One metacarpal (TTU-A800) exhibits extensive damage to the posterior raargins of the proximal articular surface, presumably a result of repeated blow raarks in detaching the distal forelirab. The bison (Bison antiguus) eleraents consist of a thoracic spine, part of a bassiocciput, a fragmentary molar, and at least part of a skull (missing from the collections) located in the northwest part of Block E. The recovery of an isolated vertebral spine, and scatter of skull parts suggests also that this raay be the fringe of a butchering or processing locale. Both the antelope and bison were recovered at about the same elevation. Other faunal remains that may or may not be associated with the above mentioned activities include a broken coyote (Canis latrans) tibia, several turtle carapace sections (Terrapene sp., T. ornata, and Kinosternum flavescens), an unidentified bird phalange, and the distal half of a jack rabbit (Lepus califomicus) DESCRIPTION: Occupational zone containing lithics and fragmented faunal remains. ILLUSTRATION: Horizontal placement of mapped items in Figure 81. 279 DISCUSSION: Although the recovered artifacts from this feature are distributed throughout all three blocks (Fig. 82), raost of the material, especially the lithics, is concentrated in Block G and the westem half of Block F. Considering the type of lithics recovered, this concentration is probably the refuse associated with the edge of a camp area. The lithics include three scrapers, two biface fragments and three flakes (one utilized). All three scrapers are made of different types of material. One end scraper (TTU-A23959; see Fig. 78), with a relatively high-backed dorsal ridge, is raade of Edwards Plateau chert ranging in color from light olive (5Y6/1) to brownish (5YR4/1) gray. The darker color tones raay be the result of prior heat-treatment of the material. Although all four margins show retouch, only the broad, distal edge displays heavy use daraage. The other end scraper (TTU-A822; see Fig. 83) has a relatively broad, distal working edge and is made of mottled, dark greenish gray (5GY4/1) to raoderate yellow green (5GY7/4) Potter's chert. Both lateral edges also show considerable retouch and heavy daraage. The third scraper (TTU-A873; see Fig. 46a) was made on a small flake of mottled, moderate, reddish orange (10R6/6) to very light gray (N8) chalcedony. It exhibits extensive retouch and edge damage along all of the margins, although the steepest retouch and damage occurs along the distal edge. One biface fragment (TTU-A887; see Fig. 77) raade of light olive gray (5Y6/1) Edwards Plateau chert raay have once been a scraper, although subsequent re-working has destroyed most of the original raargins. The other biface fragment (TTU-A926; see Fig. 73b) is made of grayish red (5R4/2) Morrison (?) quartzite. It displays two prominent side notches and may have been the base of a hafted (?) knife. Of the three flakes recovered, one is rather broad (TTU-A961; see Fig. 84) and raade of 280 Potter's chert; another is a broken thinning flake (TTU-A853; MD20) of raoderate (5YR3/4) to light (5YR5/6) brown Tecovas chert; while the third is a small (L16; W9; T2) retouch flake (TTU-A897) that exhibits steep micro-wear damage along the proximal half of its left lateral margin. The faunal remains, largely unmapped, consist of about 120 pieces of bone scrap; the broken, proxiraal segment of a tibia of a juvenile B_^ antiquus; a fetal bison second phalange; a bobcat (Lynx rufus) tooth; a badger (Taxidea taxus) tibia, a humerus, and a femur; and numerous coyote (Canis latrans), turtle (Terrapene sp., T^ ornata, and Kinosternum flavescens), rabbit (Sylvilagus sp., ^ auduboni, Lepus sp., and _L^ califoricus) and pronghorn antelope (Antilocapra americana) zone containing lithic and faunal debris. ILLUSTRATION: Mapped iteras on file at The Museura of Texas Tech University. DISCUSSION: A vertical plot of the artifacts and bone raaterial frora this feature shows a fairly even distribution throughout all three blocks (Fig. 82). Not enough iteras are mapped, however, so it is not known if there are any particular areas of concentration. The lithics consist of one core, a projectile point, a scraper fragment, four flakes, and a piece of iron-stained micaceous sandstone (TTU-A901). The core (TTU-A974; see Fig. 79a) is made of mottled yellowish (5Y8/1) to olive (5Y4/1) gray Potter's chert and roughly discoidal in outline with several flakes having been bifacially struck off along the margin. The projectile point (TTU-A863; see Fig. 76) 281",

                "text": ") places the position of this tool at about the middle of the 2C cienega in Block G, although the measureraents indicate a slightly lower elevation. The scraper fragment (TTU-A973; seeFig. 79c) still exhibits parts of two working edges that show considerable micro-edge crushing. It was made on a grayish blue (5P5/2) chert that has been extensively heat-treated. Of the four flakes recovered, TTU-A862 is of raedium gray (N6) Edwards Plateau chert, TTU-A852 is of the same Potter's chert as the core, TTU-A854 is of a very dark red (5R2/6) unidentified chert, and TTU-A902 is of a slightly translucent olive gray (5Y4/1) Edwards Plateau chert. The latter is a roughly boot-shaped flake (L39; W22; T4) that exhibits edge damage from utilization along its left lateral margin.The faunal reraains recovered frora this feature are very sirailar to those recovered in feature GA12-2.They include a few pieces of B. antiguus bone scrap, and eleraents of rabbit (Sylvilagus sp., S. auduboni, Lepus sp., and L. californicus), pronghorn antelope (Antilocapra americana), turtle (Terrapene sp., X^ ornata, and Kinosternum flavescens), coyote (Canis latrans), and prairie dog (Cynorays ludovicianus). In addition, there are a few unidentified rodent and bird elements. One small (MD17) longitudinal piece of mammal or bird, long bone shaft (TTU-A916) has had both ends ground smooth and exhibits a series of perpendicular incised lines along the length of the shaft. The marks are symetrically 282 placed about 1 mm apart and are definitely intentional as part of the decoration of this tubular bone bead. EQUIVALENT: May be related to feature GA12-2. area containing lithic and faunal remains. ILLUSTRATION: Mapped items on file at The Museum of Texas Tech University. DISCUSSION: This feature zone is restricted to Blocks G and F (Fig. 82). The lithics consist of one decortification flake (TTU-A872) of moderate yellowish brown (10YR5/4) Tecovas orthoquartzite and a broken (MD30) flake scraper (TTU-A921) of a variably colored Alibates or Tecovas chert. The faunal remains are those of coyote (Canis latrans), jack rabbit (Lepus califomicus), turtle (Terrapene sp., and Chelonia sp.), leapord frog (Rana pipiens), and pronghom antelope (Antilocapra araericana). The latter is mostly represented by the remains of one articulated individual (TTU-A903; see Fig. 85) found in Block G that had apparently died a natural death. EQUIVALENT: Noen postulated at this time. FEATURE: GA12-5 SUBSTRATUM: 2B (lowermost) DESCRIPTION: Bison kill/butchering locale. ILLUSTRATION: Horizontal placement of raapped iteras in Figure 86. DISCUSSION: The most notable aspect of this feature is the three distinct bone piles of remains of Bison antiquus in Blocks E and G. Some additional, unmapped bone material was distributed throughout Block F (Fig. 82). A count of phalanges and other elements indicates that three individuals are present as illustrated in Figure 86. At least one individual was juvenile; while one was probably an adult male, as indicated by the size of one, very large metacarpal (TTU-A947). The presence of one 283 pregnant female is noted by the recovery of a broken fetal phalange (TTU-A23733). Unfortunately, little of specific butchering techniques can be discussed since several elements, particularly pelves and ribs, are missing from the collections. In addition, most of the surviving bones have suffered frora previous handling and storage conditions. Two eleraents with possible cut marks to the anterior shaft are a first phalange (TTU-A23731) and a proximal radius segment (TTU-A948). One large flake side scraper (TTU-A922; see Fig. 87) was found in the center of Block F. It was raade frora a decortification flake from a cobble of Potter's chert. Other unmapped faunal reraains are those of a carapace section (Terrapene sp.), a few broken coyote (Canis latrans) elements, and several broken and possibly butchered bone of pronghorn antelope (activity zone containing burned caliche, one flake and miscellaneous bone items. ILLUSTRATION: Mapped items on file at The Museum of Texas Tech University. DISCUSSION: The material recovered from this feature is both sparse and of a relative deep depth in vertical distribution (Fig. 29) indicating that they were deposited over a long period of time. The lithic items found include a few pieces of burned caliche and a probable utilized flake (TTU-A984; see Fig. 73a) of a grayish red (5R4/2), very fine grained quartzite. Due to the nature of the material, it is difficult to ascertain if edge damage is the result of cultural activity; however, the distal 284 half of a prominent medial ridge that runs the length of the dorsal surface exhibits quite a bit of flattening and polish. This was probably a result of unintentional grinding during a cutting or scraping activity since the other margins still exhibit sharp and unabraded margins. Faunal remains, probably not related to any cultural activity, include a coyote (Canis latrans) astragalus, a pronghorn antelope (Antilocapra americana) patella, and a fragmented gopher (Geomys bursarius) skull. EQUIVALENT: Correlates straitgraphically with feature GA12kill/butchering locale. ILLUSTRATION: Only mapped iteras in Figure 29. DISCUSSION: This feature consists of reraains of Bison antiguus. The eleraents recovered include: the right half of a raaxilla, several teeth (raostly upper raolars), tarsals, a complete tibia, two tibia epiphyses, a distal feraur segraent, a few rib fragments, an almost coraplete humerus, scapula fragments, a fragmented juvenile raetatarsal, a coraplete juvenile metatarsal, a fragmented proximal juvenile femur and a juvenile (now raissing) skull. At least one individual was recovered, although the size and epiphysial union of a few bones indicates that two juvenile animals of slightly different ages may be present. The bones were distributed throughout both blocks (Fig. 29), although most of the larger, mapped elements were concentrated in Block N. Both the condition of preservation and lack of mapped bones precludes any discussion of specific butchering techniques. One distal femur segment (TTU-A999), however, has had its anterior trochlear surface chopped away, presumably in dismantling the lower limb.",

DISCUSSION: This feature consists only of a few bone of Bison antiquus restricted in distribution to Block S, Unfortunately, many, and perhaps, most, of the recovered eleraents are raissing frora the collections. The remaining elements include a phalange, a partial cubonavicular, a thoracic caput frora a transverse process, and a few pieces of bone scrap. The epiphysial cap would indicate the presence of an iramature animal.

EQUIVALENT: Correlates with LLP features FA5-8 and FA5-10. plot only in Figure 26. DISCUSSION: As with the preceding feature, only bones of Bison antiquus are present. Several items are missing from the collections. Of those remaining, most are fragmentary due to post-excavation handling and storage conditions. One broken metacarpal (TTU-A22449) does show several old fractures where the bone had originally been split longitudinally along the diaphyses. At least one juvenile is present as indicated by one proxiraal femur epiphysis. Distribution of this feature in only Blocks U and A (Fig. 26) suggests that two distinct activity areas may be present, although it should be noted that the bone vertical plots are only approxiraated. EQUIVALENT: None postulated at this time. FEATURE: GA5-3 SUBSTRATUM: 2B/2A contact DESCRIPTION: Probable bison kill/butchering locale. ILLUSTRATION: Vertical distribution only in Figure 26. DISCUSSION: As with the previous two features, many of the eleraents of Bison antiquus are raissing and those surviving have badly deteriorated. Two tools, a biface (knife?) (TTU 60-47-285; see Fig. 71) and a scraper (TTU 60-47-279; see Fig. 72), were recovered frora this horizon (see Fig. 25). Both tools are raissing frora the collections. At least two bison, an adult and juvenile, are represented. The juvenile was probably four years old, as indicated by an unfused radius caput. Stratigraphic and chronologic position would place this feature within the Plainview period horizon. EQUIVALENT: Probably correlates with LLP feature FA5station containing lithic and bison material, ILLUSTRATION: Vertical distribution on file at The Museum of Texas Tech University. DISCUSSION: This feature consists of only a few lithic items from Block EE. Although elements of bison (Bison antiquus), 287 horse (Equus caballus), coyote (Canis latrans), pronghom antelope (Antilocapra americana), and turtle (Terrapene ornata and Kinostemum flavescens) have been recovered from the same substratum, their relationship to the lithics of this feature are uncertain due to a lack of provenience information. They are probably related, however. The lithics recovered include an irregularly shaped (MD185) metate fragment (TTU-A23725) of very fine grained sandstone, a piece of translucent grayish black (N2) obsidian debitage (TTU-A23932), and a broken biface fragment (TTU-A23933) of very dark red (5R2/6) to light gray (N7) Tecovas chert. EQUIVALENT: Probable correlation with LLP feature FA5-6. bison kill/butchering locale. ILLUSTRATION: Vertical plot on file at The Museum of Texas Tech University. DISCUSSION: This feature is restricted in distribution to Block DD and consists only of bones of Bison antiquus. Most of the elements present consist of fragmented vertebrae, hind limb bones, mandible parts and teeth, and a few rib fragments. It is not known if any eleraents are missing from the collections. Post-excavation breakage is coramon for raost of the bones present, except for phalanges and tarsals. At least two individuals are present based on a count of first phalanges. Stratigraphic and chronologic position of this feature would place it within the Folsom horizon at the site.",

If Green's placeraent of the TMM samples is correct, it is plausible that the age differential between the SMU and TMM samples may be due to more recent advances in laboratory raethods and control (as indicated by the plus or rainus error raargins) and the uncalibrated nature of the TMM dates.",
