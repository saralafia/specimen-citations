    "abstract": "The Lubbock Lake site, on the Llano Estacada of Texas, is best known as a Paleo-Indian locality, but it also has produced a considerable Archaic record. Archaic materials, from substratum 2e and strata 3 and 4, were found by all investigators at the site since excavations began in 1939. Substratum 2e is a sandy eolian unit deposited sometime between 8500 and 6400 years B.P. One Early Archaic feature was found in substratum 2e. Stratum 3 contains valley-margin eolian deposits, valleyaxis lacustrine sediments, and the Yellowhouse Soil. Sedimentation and soil formation occurred from 6400 to as late as 5000 years B.P. The beginning age of soil formation is unknown. Stratum 3 yielded six Middle Archaic features representing probable camping events. Stratum 4 consists of marsh sediments accumulated from 5500 to 1000 years B.P. and eolian material deposited between about 5000 and 4500 years B.P. The Lubbock Lake Soil formed in stratum 4 from 4500 to 1000 years B.P. and locally is still forming. Stratum 4 contained at least 22 Middle Archaic features, including several Bison bison bone beds, numerous camping areas and hearths, and a large oven probably used for vegetal processing. The Late Archaic is represented by nine features composed of camping debris and a hearth found within the buried A horizon of the Lubbock Lake Soil. However, because this horizon represents a stable land surface that existed well into the Ceramic period, Archaic and later materials probably are mixed. Available data indicate that during the period 6400 to 4500 years B.P., two severe droughts occurred throughout at least the central Llano Estacada. The record at Lubbock Lake demonstrates that at least that area was not abandoned during this time of climatic stress, probably because water always was available. A proposed model for the Archaic on the Llano Estacada includes five shifts in the general mixed economy of plant and animal resources coinciding with climatic events. The model is one of in situ development with its basis in late Paleo-Indian times and continuing into the following period.",

The Archaic is that time span between the Paleo-Indian and Ceramic periods, generally considered to encompass the time from 8000 years B.P. to 2000 years B.P. (e.g., McKinney 1981; Weir 1976) . On the Llano Estacada, the Archaic arbitrarily was subdivided into Early (8000-6000 years B.P.), Middle (6000-4000 years B.P.), and Late (4000-2000 years B.P.) (Holliday 1977) . The only sites known on the Llano Estacada with evidence of extensive Archaic occupations in a deep stratified context are Blackwater Draw Locality #1 (Hester 1972) , Lubbock Lake, and possibly Chalk Hollow (Wedel 1975) . This paper is a discussion of the Archaic material recovered at Lubbock lake and includes a summary of the Archaic throughout the Llano Estacada and a brief review of the Archaic in neighboring areas.",

The Pecos Valley section, which includes the Mescalero (Querecho) Plains, is another division of the Great Plains and is west and southwest of the Llano Estacada (Hunt 1974; Fenneman 1931) . The Southern Plains is a general, informal term that includes the Llano Estacada, Mescalero Plains, and the southern Central Lowlands.",

In the Lubbock area, Yellowhouse Draw has cut through the Blackwater Draw Formation and into the Blanco Formation (Fig. 4) . The draw attained a maximum relief of about 15 m in the latest Pleistocene (Stafford 1977) . The draw began to aggrade prior to about 11,000 years B.P. and has been filling intermittently throughout the Holocene. Five basic geologic units and five named soils formed therein have been identified at Lubbock lake. The five principal strata are numbered oldest to youngest. Vertical subdivisions (substrata) within each numbered unit are identified by an uppercase letter, alphabetically, oldest to youngest. Principal facies within a given stratum or substratum are identified by a lowercase letter (/ = lacustrine, e = eolian, s = slopewash). The chronology of all strata and soils is well controlled by numerous radiocarbon ages (Holliday et al. 1983, 1 985) . All cited ages are given in radiocarbon years B.P.

Stratum 2 is a lacustrine (2A) and marsh (28) unit deposited between 11,000 and 8500 years B.P. During the Early Archaic (8500-6400 years B.P.), the Firstview Soil formed in upper substratum 28. Along the valley axis, the soil formed under poorly drained conditions with water near and probably at times at the surface. Along the valley margin, the soil formed under better drained conditions. Although the potential exists for an Early Archaic record within this soil, as of yet, cultural materials have not been found. Along the west and south sides of the va~ley, however, sandy sediments (substratum 2e) up to 50 em thick accumulated as the Firstview Soil was forming. These deposits comprise substratum 2F of Stafford (1981) and Holliday (1985a) . Although Stafford (1981) considered these sands to be re!ated to spring discharge, Holliday and Johnson (1982) noted that direct field evidence for spring discharge was lacking. Holliday (1985a) suggested that these sands may be eolian sediments, which now has been confirmed by evidence from scanning electron micrography. The SEM micrographs show that quartz grains in the unit were subjected to eolian transport. These sands, therefore, represent a transgression of the eolian facies of stratum 2, substratum 2e (Homday 1 985a), across substratum 28. Substratum 2e typically is reddish-brown where it is identified in well-drained upslope positions along the western and southern valley margins. The sands in the poorly drained environment of the valley axis are olive colors.",

Burial of stratum 3 and the soil was time-transgressive. Along the valley-axis, stratum 3 was eroded and buried by substratum 4A beginning by about 5500 years B.P.

An attempt at correlating the terminology is presented in Table 1 . A few comments are in order concerning the correlations and their inherent uncertainties. Probably the most confusing aspect of the ear~ier stratigraphic terminology is the assignment of stratigraphic nomenclature to pedologic features. The A horizon of the lubbock Lake Soil was designated \"Stratum IVa\" and \"Stratum V\" by Wheat (1974) , \"Stratum 5\" by Green (1962a; Kaczor 1978) , and \"substratum 4C\" by Johnson (1974) and Stafford (1981) . The parent material of the A horizon (substratum 48) was deposited not later than about 4500 years B.P., and the soil formed since then. Individual soil horizons do not have stratigraphic significance. (Holliday 1982a , 1983 , 1985a , (Stafford 1981 (Wheat 197 4 ) (Green 1962a; (Evans 1949; 1985b , 1985c , this paper) Johnson 1974) Trench A, Kelley 1974 The time span encompassed by soil formation led to some of the confusion concerning artifact provenience (e.g., Kelley 1974) . Late Archaic or Ceramic age material easily could have been and undoubtedly was worked into upper 4B through bioturbation after the material was left on the surface represented by the A horizon. Where stratum 4 was not buried, younger aged material undoubtedly also occurs. Material recovered from the uppermost portion of the A horizon, therefore, probably has been disturbed and may well represent a mixture of several thousand years of cultural history. Material deeper in the A horizon probably has been less disturbed.",

On the southwest side of the site, where the WPA work was concentrated ( Fig. 3 ), this calcic horizon formed in lower substratum 4B and upper substratum 3e and is superimposed over the upper portion of the Yellowhouse Soil in the latter unit. Moving toward the valley margin (to the southwest), the calcic horizon developed nearer the surface and entirely is within substratum 4B. Exactly where along WPA Trench A West the calcic horizon becomes wholely contained within 48 is not known. Wheat (1974:Fig. 1 ) also indicated that his Stratum IVc extended southwest along Trench\u2022 A beyond the bedrock valley wall (Blanco Formation; WPA units A-G). Available geologic data now suggest that IVc beyond the valley wall (starting at WPA Unit 270) probably is the calcic horizon of a soil formed in LLP stratum 5.",

During Wheat's (1974) excavations at Lubbock Lake, a long trench and adjacent unit ( Fig. 3) were opened up on the west side of the reservoir. In that trenching, both lithic and bone materials were recovered from strata 3 and 4. Although confusion existed in earlier reports (Kelley 1974; Alexander 1978; Wheat 1974) as to the provenience, age, or significance of these materials, LLP stratigraphic trenching on the west side, analysis of the sediments still adhering to the artifacts, and correlation of Wheat's (1974) data with LLP data (Table 1 ) clarify the matter of artifact placement and paleotopography. Kelley (1974) presented an involved discussion of \"Zones A, B, C, and D\" of \"Stratum 4\" from Green's (1962a) work. Resolving these problems is difficult, however, because information is not available on \"Zones C and D.\" The correlations for these units (Table 1) are based solely on description. Kelley (1974:68) also discussed a group of artifacts recovered during the WPA excavations from below Wheat's (1974) Stratum IV. This discussion led Alexander (1978:21) to conclude that pre-Clovis material had been found at Lubbock Lake in \"middle or early Pleistocene\" clays. Artifacts were recovered from the surface and within cracks of the Blanco Formation (Pliocene) bedrock along the valley walls on the southwest side of the site where the unit was exposed to weathering during the early Holocene. The artifacts are Archaic tools reworked into the blocky, highly friable Blanco clay at the point where substratum 4B onlaps the bedrock.",

Isolating the categories of human-induced modifications and identifying specimens within those categories were based on: (1} key characters that indicated dynamic loading of fresh bones (e.g., helical fracture, impact point, hackle marks} in contrast to carnivore action characters; and (2} characters that point to subsequent use. Use-wear constitutes localized and restricted post-fracturing bone removal along the fractured edge. Usewear characters were compared with the kinds and location of damage produced by carnivores, and specimens designated as tools generally lack carnivore damage (Johnson 1985}.",

A significant portion of the Lubbock Lake lithic artifact inventory from the Archaic period is made of fine-grained chert that varies in color from tan to light, medium, and dark gray, and dark blue. Although this material is referred to as Edwards Formation chert, it is not possible to demonstrate that the material was imported from central Texas where outcrops of Edwards Formation (Cretaceous) are very common. As Holliday and Welty (1981} pointed out, identical material occurs in gravel and cobble forms in the Ogallala Formation (Miocene-P~iocene), which crops out extensively along the eastern escarpment of the Llano Estacada. This material probably was derived from Cretaceous deposits that were being eroded as the Ogallala was being deposited. All excavations at Lubbock Lake prior to the LLP were carried out using feet and inches. For this reason, in this paper, linear and depth measurements pertaining to the earlier work at the site are kept in feet and inches. Lubbock Lake Project excavations were conducted in the metric system, and measurements pertaining to that work are given in that system. Measurements on lithic flakes and tools are presented in Table 3 and (Wheat 1974) was carried out using pick and shovel without screening. All recovered artifacts were plotted on a stratigraphic cross section according to geologic unit, depth below the surface, and distance from a datum. The TMM material (TMM accession record) was quarried from the walls (1974) . * * LL Soil-Lubbock Lake Soil. Table 4 . Lubbock Lake Archaic Local Faunas.",

These excavations were within 1O-ft squares and within natural stratigraphic levels ranging from 2 to 8 in. thick. Artifacts were plotted according to depth below surface and with reference to the walls of the squares. The LLP excavations were conducted in 1-m squares and 5-cm levels within natural stratigraphic levels using trowels, brushes, and dental tools. All materials found were mapped in place with reference to the main horizontal datum, and elevations were determined using an engineer's level. Horizontal and vertical control was referenced from the same datum (Benchmark 1 ). All excavated sediment was washed through a series of finemesh screens for recovery of microcultural and microbiological materials. The WTM, WPA, and LLP excavaton units and TMM stations were located with reference to the same benchmark, although the systems employed were different. The benchmark was assigned differing arbitrary elevations by TMM and WTM work. For LLP excavations, the elevation above sea level for that benchmark was determined. Accession or catalog numbers are listed for reference indentification of specimens. Items with the accession prefix 40-36 are from Wheat's (1974) excavations; while those prefixed by 892 were recovered by Evans and Meade (Sellards 1952 ).

Material from the lowermost zone may be in situ and not mixed, but artifacts from the other six zones include a mixture of Archaic and post-Archaic materials. Primarily lithic material, which appears to represent various camping events, was recovered. Green (1962a) uncovered a small concentration of modern bison remains in Area 7 (GA7-7) at the bottom of the A horizon. The material exhibits human-induced modification and may represent a bison kill/butchering locale. Three levels of occupational debris were encountered during Green's (1962a) and Kelley's (1974) concordant explorations in Area 8 (Fig. 3) . The scattered material and hearthstones indicate several camping events.",

Cone flaking on the interior fracture surface indicates the initial impact was on the posterior diaphysis just below the lateral tuberosity (Fig. 17b ) . The element was positioned on its anterior side. A rebound impact was not preserved, which may indicate a double anvil mode. The apex of the fracture is on the external lateral side. A number of overlapping flake scars occur along the anterior section of the fracture edge (Fig. 17c) . These scars and two adjacent internal ridges on the fracture surface are covered by polish. Flaking and polish are restricted to this area. While the element may have been used as a tool, possible carnivore tooth scoring below and parallel to the flaked edge makes the element suspect (Fig. 17d) . The radius was accessioned as \"from M-4?\". At Station M, the A horizon of the Lubbock Lake Soil was eroded. Based on bone preservation, the element is not from substratum 4A.

A high concentration of artifacts and features can be seen in Wheat's (1974) Trench A West from units 90 to 180 and 200 to 240 (Fig. 5) . Unfortunately, the southwestern section of the trench which contained material from units 200 to 240 no longer exists due to destruction by construction activities. Deposits surrounding Trench A West from Datum B southwest to unit 180 basically are intact. The LLP oven (FA 16-1) is roughly 30 m northwest ofWPA unit 160 in Trench A West. The TMM excavators encountered several extensive bone beds, and Green (1962a) and Kelley (1974) uncovered hearths and camping debris.

These kills (7 to 23 bison per kill) contained a variety of projectile points (Ellis, Marcos, Esnor, Pa!millas, Trinity, and Twilla). These sites were believed to be Late Archaic kills dating at around 2500 years ago based on radiocarbon dated kills with very similar projectile point assemblages from the lower Pecos region (Dibble 1968) . However, radiocarbon dates on bone from four kills averaged 1387 \u00b1 112 years B.P. (A.D. 563 \u00b1 112) (Hughes 1977: Table 2 ). If the bone dates can be accepted, they indicate that the sites are considerably younger, and, based on the association of dart points and ceramics at Deadman's Shelter (Willey and Hughes 1978) , the bone beds are from Ceramic times. Sites with mixed dart and arrow point assemblages also were found in Tule Canyon, just below Mackenzie Reservoir (Katz and Katz 1 976) . The number of archaeological sites in this area with both dart and ::3now points but lacking pottery suggests that the arrow point tradition preceded the Ceramic tradition.",

These data clearly demonstrate that considerable eolian sedimentation occurred throughout the Llano Estacada at this time, apparently the result of a decrease in effective precipitation. These data also suggest that the two periods of middle Holocene drought identified at lubbock Lake were regional phenomena. Benedict and Olson (1978) and Benedict (1979) proposed a \"Two-drought Aitithermal\" for the western United States with aridity maxima at 7500 to 6500 and 6000 to 5500 years B.P. These ages are remarkably similar to those from lubbock Lake and the Llano Estacada considering that they are based on entirely different lines of evidence. The Altithermal maxima may have been reached at different times in different areas depending on the regional response to changes in atmospheric circulation. The evidence suggests that periodically at least (perhaps seasonally?), the environment of the Llano Estacado during the Middle Archaic was rather inhospitable. There were times when considerable amounts of dust were blowing across the Plains. In addition, temperatures may have been quite high, helping to reduce the amount of effective moisture received.",

The few diagnostic projectile points recovered in situ from sites on the Llano Estacada provide one of the few means for comparison. Blackwater Draw Locality #1 yielded Williams, Travis, Pandale, and Pedernales points dating to about 5000 to 4500 years B.P., and Bulverde, Trinity, and Ellis points were recovered at Lubbock Lake in deposits of the same age. In central and southwest Texas, these artifact types are not found commonly in association with each other. Travis and Pedernales points are a little later (4500-3000 years B.P.) and tend to be found in central Texas and the lower Pecos River region; Williams points (4500-2000 years B.P.) are more concentrated in central Texas; Pandale points generally are older (6000-4500 years B.P.) and found in the lower Pecos River region; Bulverde points (4000-3400 years B.P.) are widespread in central Texas; Ellis points are younger (2000 years B.P.) and widespread in north-central Texas; and Trinity points (4500-3000 years B.P.) are more common in north Texas (Suhm and Jelks 1962; Guderjan 1981; Guderjan and Morehead 1981; McKinney 1981; Prewitt 1981; Lynott 1978; Weir 1976; Turner and Hester 1985) . These very limited data suggest that certain projectile point types may vary considerably in age within Texas, depending on location, and that for as yet unknown reasons, designs spanning a long period of time in central and southwest Texas (6000 to less than 2000 years B.P.) were present on the Llano Estacada during the period 5000 to 4500 years B.P., the time of the second major drought.",

A single radiocarbon date was used to provide a maximum age of about 3000 years B.P. for the Ensor, Marcos, and Bulverde types.

While the Llano Estacado never was abandoned during this time, cultural changes and subsistence shifts appear to coincide with climatic changes and stresses. The model {Table 5) is based on climatic events, subsistence activities, and numerous radiocarbon ages. The Archaic on the Llano Estacado {8500-2000 years B.P.) now is characterized by a fluctuating mixed economy of systematic use of wild plant and animal resources, typified by a variety of dart point designs, within a time period marked by climatic change from the end of pluvial conditions through extreme xeric conditions to ameliorated mesic conditions, and denoted by the modernization of faunal and vegetational communities. The Archaic is subdivided into Early {8500-6400 years B.P.), Middle {6400-4500 years B.P.), and Late {4500-2000 years B.P.), following for the most part the three general climatic stages noted. The Early Archaic occurs during a time of environmental transition from the earliest Holocene warming trend into the Middle Holocene intense xeric conditions. Extinct bison exists into at least the early part of the Early Archaic and was experiencing stress expressed as size diminution. The Middle Archaic occurs during the Middle Holocene drought or Altithermal, a time of very dry and very warm conditions. Modern bison emerges by the beginning of this period, if not somewhat earlier. The Late Archaic occurs during a return to moister and somewhat cooler conditions, perhaps similar to those of today.",

This transitional period ends about the time of another climatic change towards a warming trend. Hughes (1974) labeled this transitional period on the Llano Estacada as the Southern Plains Woodland period, characterized by influence from eastern groups. This same transitional phenomenon is seen in central Texas and is labeled the Neoarchaic (Prewitt 1981 ) . It also lasted about 1000 years but occurred 1 000 years later.",

Travis, Bulverde, Pedernales, and Williams are common in central Texas, while Trinity and Ellis are common in north-central Texas. However, these latter six types date later in time in these regions than on the Llano Estacado.",
