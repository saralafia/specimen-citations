The same is true for nearby coeval strata farther west in Texas (El Picacho Formation) and farther east in Mexico (Olmos Formation). Only a few specimens have been recovered from these strata that provide useful morphological information. These have been identified either as Torosaurus or assigned to an indeterminate taxon informally described as the \"El Picacho ceratopsian\" (TMM 42304-1) which, although too fragmentary to diagnose, is not Torosaurus (Ojeda-Rivera et al., 1968; Lawson, 1976; Lehman, 1996; Hunt and Lehman, 2008; Porras-Muzquiz and Lehman, 2011) .",

In fact, it may be impossible to confidently assign a generic identity to many chasmosaurine specimens, given their a) obvious inter-specific craniofacial similarities and b) demonstrated intra-specific variability in most craniofacial aspects. In fact, most chasmosaurine genera have skulls that look remarkably similar; therefore, specimens lacking a frill (and to a lesser degree, supraorbital hom cores) can be very difficult to identify.

Although some physiographic barriers to chasmosaurine dispersal were likely emplaced during the Sevier and Laramide orogenies, they did not prevent genetic transfer among chasmosaurines. In fact, all chasmosaurine genera are rather similar both over their temporal range o f 13 million years and at their extreme northern and southern paleobiogeographic boundaries. Furthermore, no chasmosaurine genus exhibits fitness-related morphologies (e.g., changing dentition, locomotion, or body plan) that would imply that chasmosaurines evolved in contemporaneously-evolving biomes (with increasingly unique predatory and subsistence pressures) lasting over millions o f years. This implies that chasmosaurines are more closely related than currently accepted and were likely composed of successive, interbreeding metapopulations (sensu Levins,",

These deposits consist o f well-indurated conglomeratic fluvial sandstones and variegated mudstone intervals with paleosol horizons.

At the collection site for TMM 46015-1, the Javelina Formation measures 165 meters in thickness, comparable to a measured thickness o f 147 meters on Tomillo Flat (Lehman et al., in prep.) . The type specimen o f Bravoceratops polyphemus was found in a concretionary fluvial channel horizon with thin interbeds o f siltstone, sandstone, and coarse, sandy conglomerate.

Conversely, Javelina Formation fossils are often black, white, or gray and sometimes have a brittle, fibrous texture (especially if encountered within the modern weathering zone). Alamosaurus bones, having unique camellate or coarse lamellar texture, are restricted to the Javelina and overlying Black Peaks formations and are a broad indicator that the Aguja-Javelina contact is lower in the section. Somewhat surprisingly, TMM 46015-1 exhibited only a minor encrustation of \"calcrete,\" perhaps a result of its placement at the contact between formations where the paleoenvironment, depositional regime, and corresponding taphonomic processes were in flux concurrent with Laramide tectonism. Lehman (1985) indicated that the Aguja-Javelina contact was a gradational one, and that the contact was arbitrary (having no real stratigraphic significance). However, distinct east-west variations within the Javelina Formation indicate that the contact may actually be disconformable in many central and eastern areas of BIBE. Laramide tectonics and the associated subsidence of the Tomillo Basin likely restricted fluvial dynamics to increasingly eastern portions o f the park (Lehman, 1986) . Fluvial entrenchment in these areas penecontemporaneously eroded some portions o f the underlying Aguja Formation during deposition o f overlying Javelina Formation sediments. Therefore, the presence o f distinct, parallel hogback ridges is restricted to more easterly parts of the park along the primary axis of subsidence. Sandstones in these depositional facies are usually well-cemented, cross-bedded, and sometimes contain thin intervals o f sandy pebble conglomerate (reflecting a higher-energy regime). However, in central portions of BIBE, only the lower half o f the Javelina Formation exhibits parallel hogbacks. Upper portions consist of fine-grained, finely-laminated yellow sandstones and purple and cream-colored mudstone horizons generally lacking the hard, conglomeratic brown-weathering sandstone intervals so typical of eastern Javelina Formation outcrops. Continuing westerly, the Javelina Formation gradually loses these \"typical\" eastern fluvial facies, until the formation consists only o f colorful floodplain mudstone horizons with thick, poorly-cemented, tan sandstone intervals (herein called the \"banana split\" facies). In westerly parts o f the park, the Aguja and Javelina formations contact is more difficult to find and may only be noticed by the presence o f chert clasts or podocarpacean conifer logs. These east-to-west changes are broadly consistent throughout BIBE.",

In fact, the contact between the Javelina and Aguja formations may be truly gradational only in western portions o f the park where fluvial entrenchment was apparently subdued. As a result, the Aguja Formation-Javelina Formation contact likely becomes increasingly disconformable (although likely within a negligible geologic timeframe) as these formations trend from west to east in concordance with the development of the Tomillo Basin. Finally, although sometimes obscure, the Aguja Formation-Javelina Formation contact can be interpreted and consistently located within most areas of the park.

The presence o f volcanically-derived chlorite in these \"sick green\" strata suggests that a somewhat unfavorable environment existed at times during periods of localized eruptive events (Befus et al., 2008) , which might account for the general lack of vertebrate fossils in this interval. On the other hand, the presence of unique assemblages of the dicot trees Metcalfeoxylon and Agujoxylon indicates that the environment was not completely unsuitable at the \"sick green\" interval. The Metcalfeoxylon-Agujoxylon (M-A) association is one of four found in the Aguja Formation, each characteristic o f a particular sedimentary facies (Wheeler and Lehman, 2000) . Present only in the uppermost Aguja Formation, the M-A association is found in fluvial facies that accumulated in the most inland portion o f the formation's coastal floodplain deposits that accumulated at increasingly greater distance from the paleoshoreline and at increasingly higher elevations (Lehman and Wheeler, 2001 ). The complete lack o f extra-basinal clasts in the Aguja Formation discounts a tectonic cause for increasing elevation and favors an explanation involving gradually lowering sea levels as the result of cooler climate trends (Miller et al., 1999) .",

Compared to fossilized wood from other parts o f the late Campanian and early Maastrichtian section, the unusual preservational style reflected by these woods, often colored white and having a waxy luster (Fig. 2) , is likely the result of the devitrification of the mafic ash in the sediments (T. Lehman pers. comm.). The copious presence of fallen logs and fossil wood fragments, as well as several occurrences o f in-situ stumps, within the \"sick green\" interval may have been the result o f mass mortality via ash fall, although this is speculative, given that no obvious ash beds are known anywhere at this interval within BIBE. Sedimentation rates at this time are perceived to have been very low (e.g., presence o f thick, well-laminated mudstone intervals and general lack of thick, higher-energy fluvial sandstone bodies). Although it is tempting to attribute the general lack of vertebrate fossils in the uppermost Aguja Formation to an unfavorable environment, it is also possible that deposition rates precluded the rapid burial of carcasses and that preservational bias is largely responsible for the lack of vertebrate fossils at this interval. Although strata exposed at the Aguja-Javelina formations contact represent a linear transitional zone from coastal to inland habitats, it is more likely that many paleoenvironmental changes observed at this stratigraphic interval are the result o f both a moderating, early Maastrichtian climate and the onset o f Laramide tectonism in the Big Bend region, which ushered in a new sedimentological regime and a change in the sediment source area. This event is recorded at the base of the Javelina Formation by the (sometimes copious) presence o f chert clasts, a change in paleocurrent direction, and the re-establishment of a higher-energy fluvial regime (Lehman, 1986 (Lehman, , 1991 .",

This is especially true regarding the parietal, which, taxonomically, is the most useful part o f the skull. Other skull fragments were also very informative. These include the preserved portions o f the nasals and the portions of the cheek formed by the epijugal, jugal, and quadratojugal. The proximal portion o f this nasal fragment also contains a puncture-like excavation (approximately 25 mm in diameter and 8 mm deep) which is interpreted to be pathologic. It is tempting to attribute this apparent lesion to a horn-thrust injury related to intra-specific combat. Although previous studies have examined ceratopsian adaptations regarding combat (Farlow and Dodson, 1975; Sampson et al., 1997) , additional research involving Triceratops (Farke, 2004) Furthermore, depending on the severity, surficial trauma would normally cause a reaction to the separation o f periosteum from underlying bone tissue. In this case, reactive periosteal bone is absent around the margin of the lesion. Perhaps the \"injury\" was not serious enough to cause a rigorous inflammatory response (although in this case the angle of \"impact\" appears somewhat shallow, and, therefore, may have been somewhat shunted and less damaging). It is also possible that the lesion was emplaced as the result of infection (osteomyelitis) or from incidental contact within the environment. Without detailed histological analyses, the exact cause remains speculative.",

The varied coossification of episquamosals in B. polyphemus is compatible with observations in other chasmosaurines where these fused progressively from proximal to distal end with age, and their sutural contacts were obscured with progressive bone remodeling.",

The short, preserved section near the medial border has a rounded edge that is no more than 4 mm thick.

Similar to that described for Triceratops by Hatcher et al., (1907, p. 17) , this fragment preserves the dorsal part of the central \"keel\" formed by the union of the supraoccipital and exoccipitals. It vertically divides the cavity formed by the lateral pillars of the supraoccipital, creating two deep pockets for attachment o f cervical musculature. This median keel expands dorsally to form a buttress at the supraoccipital-parietal contact and supported the parietal near its union with the postorbitals. Above this buttress, a small, smooth-walled cavity is present that is interpreted to be a remnant o f the supracranial sinus below the postfrontal fontanelle (Gilmore, 1919; Farke, 2010) . Formation is diagnosed solely on the basis o f a left squamosal (Sullivan and Lucas, 2010) . The Naashoibito Member is assigned an early Maastrichtian age by Sullivan and Lucas (2010) ; however, Williamson and Weil (2008) assigned it a late Maastrichtian timeframe based upon the presence o f the multituberculate Essonodon as well as the metatherian mammal Glasbius c.f. G. intricatus, which has been proposed as a potential first appearance datum for the Lancian Land Mammal \"Age.\" The squamosal o f \"Ojoceratops\" is also similar enough to Triceratops \"serratus\" (AMNH 970) to be referred to this genus by Longrich (2011) . If so, the presence of Triceratops (DMNH 48617) in the late Maastrichtian Laramie Formation of eastern Colorado (Dodson et al., 2004, p. 496; Diem and Archibald, 2005) places Triceratops within a reasonable geographical proximity to ' ''Ojoceratops\". Sullivan and Lucas (2010) also refer additional isolated elements to c.f. \"Ojoceratops\" although these cannot be conclusively attributed to that taxon given the presence o f two large ceratopsids in the Ojo Alamo Formation (\"Ojoceratops\" and Torosaurus). As a result, referral o f these isolated elements to either genus cannot be reliably made, as many portions o f the chasmosaurine skull exhibit (sometimes marked) ontogenetic and intra-specific variability (Ostrom and Wellnhofer, 1990; Godfrey and Holmes, 1995; Forster, 1996; Sampson et al., 1997;  and the presence of two large chasmosaurines in the Ojo Alamo Formation, and without a more complete specimen exhibiting a single demonstrable autapomorphy (or even a small comparative sample of isolated, analogous elements), \"Ojoceratops\" is considered to be a nomen dubium.",

Here, they incorrectly interpreted the stratigraphic position of Lawson's (1976) Torosaurus parietal specimen as follows: \"He (Lawson) also referred an incomplete parietal (TMM 41480-1) from the lower third o f the Javelina Formation (Tomillo Group), Big Bend region of Texas, to T. utahensis. \" In contrast, Lawson (p. 163) stated that the specimen came from the \"lower third o f the Tomillo Group; Maestrichtian Age,\" but he did not specify a formation. The Tomillo Group includes the Late Cretaceous and Paleogene Javelina, Black Peaks, and Hannold Hill formations (having up to 650 m o f combined strata) (Lehman et al., in prep) . The (entirely Cretaceous) Javelina Formation occupies the lowest 183 m (maximum) of these deposits (Lehman et al., in prep.) . In fact, all o f the reported Torosaurus remains from the Javelina (including TMM 41480-1) are from the upper part o f the formation (which is in the lower third of the Tomillo Group) and are likely middle-to-late Maastrchtian (Lancian NALMA) in age (Maxwell et al., 1967; Lawson, 1976; Lehman, 1996 The squamosal in Bravoceratops is most similar to other long-frilled types that have relatively straight squamosals (Chasmosaurus, Utahceratops, Pentaceratops), in contrast to those in which the squamosals are dorsally curved (Kosmoceratops, Vagaceratops, \"Agujaceratops\") . The variable thickness of the proximal end o f the squamosal mirrors the similar, variably thick condition described by Lehman (1996) for the \"El Picacho ceratopsian.\" The low, elliptical episquamosals in Bravoceratops are comparable to those in most other chasmosaurines, not as peaked or triangular as in Anchiceratops, but episquamosal form is known to vary ontogenetically in some taxa (Triceratops, Homer and Goodwin, 2006) .",

In Bravoceratops, the quadratojugal was preserved disarticulated from the squamosal, a condition that is unusual; many large ceratopsian skulls are found with the two elements intact and thoroughly coossified. It is possible that the bifurcated condition is more common than perceived and is often obscured as the result o f sutural fusion. In Bravoceratops, the quadratojugal contributes to the lower portion of the rim of the laterotemporal fenestra, the usual condition among chasmosaurines more derived than Chasmosaurus, but the presence o f a bifurcated articulation with the squamosal may represent a further derived condition shared with Torosaurus and Triceratops.",

This morphology suggests that the bridge of the nose, posterior to the nasal homcore, was narrower than in other chasmosaurines. The \"El Picacho ceratopsian\" may be similar; it also has a mild posterior constriction of the nasals. In Bravoceratops this could reflect either a proportionally longer snout or a dorsally elevated position o f the external nares compared to other large chasmosaurines. The nasal bridge in Bravoceratops is also very shallow dorsoventrally. This condition is similar to that in some specimens o f Triceratops (\"N ed o cera to p sFarke, 2011) but in contrast with most other chasmosaurines, especially Coahuilaceratops, where the dorsoventral depth o f the nasal just caudal to the nasal hom (87 mm) is almost twice that in Bravoceratops (45 mm), a condition retained \"throughout most of the length of the nasal\" (Loewen et al., 2010, p. 105) Chasmosaurus differs in having a jugal and squamosal that meet along the lower border o f the infratemporal fenestra, excluding the quadratojugal. Therefore, Bravoceratops is probably more closely related to the latter two taxa and in particular Pentaceratops, which has the same deep oblique grooves on the ventral surface of the parietal midline bar. However, both Utahceratops and Pentaceratops have a marked embayment in the posterior margin o f the parietal with a pair o f upturned epiparietals on either side of the midline. The posterior end of the parietal in Bravoceratops is, instead, fan-shaped and broad anteroposteriorly, with a depression on its dorsal surface that likely bore an epiparietal on the midline, all features shared with Anchiceratops. The parietal in Anchiceratops has a conjoined pair o f laterally divergent epiparietals on its dorsal midline surface, rather than a single one as appears to be the case in Bravoceratops, and the posterior margin has paired exaggerated epiparietals on either side o f the midline, rather than a single low, unadorned epiparietal astride the midline. Bravoceratops shares this latter feature with Torosaurus utahensis (? = \"Ojoceratops\") and Triceratops. The bifurcated squamosal articulation on the quadratojugal in Bravoceratops is also shared with at least some specimens o f Torosaurus and Triceratops. The posteriorly constricted bridge of the nasals may be a unique, derived feature and suggests that Bravoceratops could be related to, if not the same as, the unnamed \"El Picacho ceratopsian\" known from coeval strata in Texas.",

However, they also suggest that the similarities regarding fitness-related characters indicate that population isolates evolved within niches that collectively remained almost unchanged over time. This seems counter-intuitive, given that even small environmental fluctuations within almost identical but isolated biomes can generate distinct morphological characters even among closely-related populations (e.g., \"Darwin's finches\"; Lack, 1947) . They go on to speculate that \"the clade underwent a dramatic radiation driven by environmental fluctuations on the one hand (causing the formation of population isolates) and by the evolution of mating signals on the other (largely driven by forces unrelated to fitness such as sexual selection)\" (Sampson and Loewen, 2010, p. 420) . Their view holds that isolated chasmosaurine populations developed unique sexual display characters and preferences over time and that these disparities would then prevent interbreeding among other closely-related populations even if environmental fluctuations reunited them. The suite o f character states exhibited by Bravoceratops suggests otherwise and supports the notion that interbreeding among contemporaneous chasmosaurine populations was not only possible but was likely essential to the fitness and long-term viability o f the clade as a whole. This substantiates the view that the paleogeographic features emplaced along the Western Interior Basin during the onset of Laramide tectonism during Maastrichtian time were not lasting barriers to genetic exchange among chasmosaurine populations.",

The metapopulation process requires some interaction among populations within discreet patches of suitable habitat in order to reduce the possibility of extinction of the entire group. In this regard it is certainly plausible that if biomes remained isolated for longer periods, daughter species may have developed alongside parent species. Resultant competition within isolated biomes may have resulted in extinction of either population (or both), leaving behind suitable habitat for new chasmosaurine immigrants and continued genetic dispersal among contemporaneous populations. This might explain the similarities among chasmosaurines regarding fitness characters while maintaining cranial distinctions among those characters involving sexual selection.",

CHAPTER III SYSTEMATIC PALEONTOLOGY Bravoceratops polyphemus is a new chasmosaurine dinosaur by original designation herein. The holotype (TMM 46015-1) consists o f a fragmentary, disarticulated adult skull including braincase with detached supraoccipital, parts o f both supraorbital homcores and rear part o f left postorbital, posterior part o f right nasal, parts o f fused nasals and epinasal, both jugals, both quadrates, both quadratojugals, parietal median bar with attached midline epiparietal, detached lateral epiparietal, parts o f right squamosal, coronoid processes o f both dentaries, fragment o f dentary lingual plate, and numerous unidentified skull fragments (Fig 3). The holotype is the only known specimen.

Etymology The prefix \"bravo\" (Spanish for \"wild\") refers to a portion o f the Rio Bravo del Norte (Mexican nomenclature) that forms the great curve o f the Rio Grande (American nomenclature) and defines the Big Bend region o f western Texas and northern Mexico. The Greek suffix \"cera tops\" (= hom-face) denotes membership in the Ceratopsidae. The species name alludes to the colossal cyclops, Polyphemus, o f Greek mythology, in reference to the midline depression or \"socket\" located on the mediodistal parietal bar of the holotype for presumed attachment of a protruding epiparietal.DiagnosisLarge chasmosaurine with fan-shaped mediodistal parietal bar lacking pronounced midline embayment; with distinct, symmetrical midline depression on its dorsal surface at the nexus of the parietal rami, and low midline epiparietal on its posterior margin.Horizon and AgeLower Javelina Formation, terminal Campanian to early Maastrichtian.COLLECTION AND PREPARATIONTMM 46015-1 was collected over a period o f seven months from September 2011 to April 2012.

The preserved portion o f the conjoined distal ends o f the nasals have a transverse width o f only 80 mm over the external nares but expand anteriorly to 135 mm at the base of the epinasal.

Photos by the author; adapted from Wick and Lehman (2013). left posterior postorbital fragment, if interpreted correctly, includes a portion o f skull roof and posterior base of the homcore. No sutural contacts with corresponding elements are evident. The fragment thickens from 23 mm to a maximum o f 35 mm approaching the base of the homcore and forms a buttress along the medial portion o f its base. Curvature o f the fragment indicates that the homcore had a wide base and a substantial cornual sinus. The abrupt deflection o f this basal homcore fragment suggests that B. polyphemus had laterally divergent, dorsally directed homcores. Based on the degree of taper in the preserved fragments, the homcores are estimated to have extended about three-quarters o f a meter in a gentle curve. As in other large chasmosaurines with pronounced cornual sinuses, I speculate that the homcores of B. polyphemus were anteriorly curved, but the direction o f curvature cannot be determined with certainty from the homcore segments preserved. Two distal homcore fragments are preserved; both are missing their tips, and one is missing a portion of lateral cortex. These are similar in size and shape, indicating that they are from nearly corresponding portions of opposite horns. Both external surfaces are etched with irregularly spaced vascular foramina and numerous longitudinal vascular channels. One fragment preserves the terminal portion (approximately 200 mm) o f the comual sinus, however; the other does not. This suggests that the depth o f the cornual sinus in B. polyphemus is rather deep, although variable even between left and right horns of the same individual. Unlike the proximal homcore fragment, the internal surface o f the comual sinus here reveals small, intermittent patches o f smooth avascular bone while the remainder is pitted and rugose. No vascular channels are present on the preserved section. Both distal homcore fragments exhibit a modest curve. They are laterally compressed and elliptical in cross section. Although one has a distinct ridge along one vertex of its major axis, the other does not; hence, this morphology varies between right and left sides. The more complete distal fragment is 242 mm long and has a minimum basal diameter o f 90 mm and a maximum basal diameter of 132 mm. A third fragment (256 mm long and 104 mm wide) is interpreted to occupy a medial position along the length of the homcore. Its surface is rugose and irregularly pitted, much like the proximal homcore fragment; however, it lacks the incised vascular channels exhibited by the distal fragments. Its internal surface is weathered but in cross section appears to preserve the narrow hollowing o f the medial comual sinus. Only a very slight deflection is exhibited along its length, which suggests that medial curvature of the homcore was modest.

                "text": "; Hunt and Lehman, COMPARATIVE DISCUSSION Chasmosaurine ceratopsids are diagnosed almost entirely on the basis o f the form and ornamentation of the squamosal-parietal frill. Other aspects o f the skull, such as the size and orientation of the nasal and postorbital homcores, and the variable configuration of the intemarial components o f the premaxilla are of subordinate importance. Therefore, the few features preserved in the fragmentary skull of Bravoceratops that are thought to be of taxonomic significance are emphasized in the following comparison. Because most chasmosaurine genera are monospecific, in this discussion each genus is referred to only by its generic name except where referring to features that are known to differ between two o f its species. Frill The preserved parts of the squamosal and parietal in Bravoceratops indicate that it is a \"long-frilled\" chasmosaurine with long squamosals, a slender midline parietal bar, and very large parietal fenestrae. This basic frill form is comparable to that found in Chasmosaurus (= \"M o jo c e ra to p sas argued by Maidment and Barrett, 2011), Vagaceratops, \"Agujaceratops,\" Utahceratops, Coahuilaceratops, and Pentaceratops. These taxa are generally regarded as the least-derived members of Chasmosaurinae. The frill is, instead, shorter or the parietal fenestrae smaller, or both, in more derived chasmosaurines such as Kosmoceratops, Anchiceratops, Arrhinoceratops, Torosaurus, Eotriceratops, and Triceratops (= \"Diceratops\" or \"N e d o ce ra to p sas argued by Ostrom and Wellnhofer, 1990)."

The single intact epiparietal in Bravoceratops is low and elliptical and comparable in form to those bordering the squamosal. This simple, unspecialized epiparietal form is also found in Arrhinoceratops, Torosaurus, and Triceratops. However, the detached epiparietal preserved with Bravoceratops indicates that it had at least one exaggerated epiparietal, probably at each comer o f the frill, as in some specimens o f Chasmosaurus, \"Agujaceratops\", and Pentaceratops. Furthermore, Bravoceratops possesses a unique configuration o f midline epiparietals, with one along the distal parietal border and another on the dorsal surface at the anterior nexus o f the parietal rami. The posterior midline epiparietal is otherwise known only in Triceratops, Torosaurus utahensis, andthe \"Naashoibito\" parietal (referable to T. utahensis or \"Ojoceratops\"). The anterior midline epiparietal, detached prior to preservation, is represented by a distinct tear-drop shaped depression on the dorsal surface of the parietal in Bravoceratops. This sutural surface may have anchored a coalesced, laterally divergent pair of midline epiparietals similar to those in Anchiceratops. However, in Bravoceratops, the attachment site is so narrow transversely that it seems likely that only a single epiparietal was bonded there."

Because Coahuilaceratops is found in broadly coeval strata nearby in Coahuila, Mexico, it is reasonable to suspect that the two chasmosaurines might be the same. The narrow and shallow nasal bridge in Bravoceratops indicates that the two are different. However, the diagnostic posterior end o f the parietal is not preserved in Coahuilaceratops, and this is the part o f the skull that differs most markedly among chasmosaurines. CHAPTER VI RELATIONSHIPS OF BRAVOCERATOPS Although the only known specimen o f Bravoceratops is fragmentary, the preserved parts are sufficient to reveal a unique combination of character states and to warrant its recognition as a unique taxon. Bravoceratops shares with Chasmosaurus, Utahceratops, and Pentaceratops 1) a long, relatively straight squamosal, 2) a slender parietal midline bar with large parietal fenestrae, and 3) one or more exaggerated epoccipitals at the posterolateral comers of frill. All other chasmosaurines have either substantially shorter or dorsally curved squamosals, a broader medial parietal with smaller (or no) parietal fenestrae, or a unique set o f exaggerated epiparietals."

The former hypothesis would require that the posterior midline epiparietal and bifurcated quadratojugal developed independently in Bravoceratops and then again later in the Torosaurus-Triceratops lineage. The latter hypothesis would require that the slender, grooved midline parietal bar and the widely open fenestrate frill in Bravoceratops was a result of later reversal to the basal chasmosaurine condition. The consequences of either hypothesis seem objectionable, and either could be favored depending on the weight one grants each o f its presumed derived features and the perceived likelihood of their repeated development by convergence or reversal. Nevertheless, it is clear that Bravoceratops occupies an intermediate phylogenetic position between the less derived forms such as Pentaceratops, and more derived forms, such as Torosaurus or Triceratops"

Possible intermediate phylogenetic positions of Bravoceratops with: (a) position among less derived and (b) more derived chasmosaurines. Adapted from Wick and Lehman (2013). Although the holotype skull and only known specimen of Bravoceratops is fragmentary, it exhibits a combination o f character states unique among chasmosaurines. It retains a long, widely open fenestrate frill comparable to that in the least derived chasmosaurines and most similar to Pentaceratops. However, the broad, fan-shaped posterior end o f the parietal and the attachment site for a dorsal midline epiparietal are derived features shared with Anchiceratops. A second midline epiparietal on the posterior edge o f the parietal and a bifurcated squamosal process on the quadratojugal are features found only in the most derived chasmosaurines, Torosaurus and Triceratops. If the tear-drop-shaped depression on the dorsal midline surface of the parietal in Bravoceratops indeed bore a single epiparietal, as hypothesized here, then this would represent a unique, derived condition. The constriction o f the nasal bridge behind the epinasal in Bravoceratops may also represent a unique, derived condition that links it"
