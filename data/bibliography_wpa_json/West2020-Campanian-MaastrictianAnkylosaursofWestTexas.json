Fossil assemblages from the two formations are allied to the \"southern\" Late Cretaceous faunas of New Mexico and Utah (Lehman, 1985 and Lehman et al., 2019) . These units range from the Early Campanian to the Late Maastrichtian (a time span of approximately 17.5 Ma); a period of time which records the final regression and closing of the Western Interior Seaway (WIS), the onset of the Laramide Orogeny, and the subsequent deposition of sediment in the Tornillo Basin. Lehman and Busbey (2007) hypothesized that the Cretaceous-Paleocene boundary was preserved locally within the lower Black Peaks Formation. Recently Leslie et al. (2013) revised the chronostratigraphic framework of the Dawson Creek locality of Big Bend and determined that the latest occurrence of dinosaur fossil in the Black Peaks is Lancian (Late Maastrichtian approx. 70-66 Ma) with the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary placed near the base of the Black Peaks Formation.",

These two subunits are separated by paralic marine deposits, denoted as the Pen Formation, which intertongues with the Aguja Formation (Lehman et al., 2019) . The age of the terrestrial deposits of the Aguja Formation was determined using ammonite biostratigraphy from the interbedded Pen Formation and radiometric dating of pyroclastic deposits. The uppermost Pen Formation was dated using the ammonite Scaphites hippocrepis III, which establishes the lower limit of the Aguja Formation as 82 Ma (Waggoner, 2006; Gradstein et al., 2012) . Baculites haresi is found within the McKinney Springs member of the Pen Formation. This ammonite ranges as far as the Baculites obtusus zone, which has been dated using 40 Ar/ 39 Ar isotopes from an intercalated tuff bed, and designates the age of this marine deposit as 80 Ma (Obradovich, 1993) . The upper age limit of the Aguja Formation was determined is between 77 Ma to 73 Ma, as determined by U/Pb dating of intercalated pyroclastic deposits (Breyer et al., 2007; Befus et al., 2008 ).",

It should be noted that most outcrops of the of the lower shale member lie on private land, so access to study outcrops is limited (Lehman, 2019) . The lower shale member was interpreted by Lehman (1985) to have been a coastal wetland environment such as a marsh or swamp. The sandstone intervals within this unit were associated with tidal creek or estuarine deposits associated with the coastal wetlands. Vertebrate fossils in the lower shale member are sparse with most specimens from this unit being fragmentary. Isolated osteoderms were identified as belonging to the Nodosauridae based on the lack of a highly excavated internal surface and a sparsely pitted external surface (Burns and Currie, 2014; Lehman 2019 ).",

This unit ranges in thickness from 123 m to 183 m, and thickens to the east. The Javelina Formation contains wellindurated sandstone beds, with basal chert-pebble conglomerate lenses marking the lower contact with the Aguja Formation. This unit contains alternating beds of sandstone and mudstones, with thin beds of lacustrine fossiliferous limestone in the eastern areas of the basin. These thin limestone beds are evidence for a change from fluvial to lacustrine facies in the basin. In addition, these lacustrine facies seem to be restricted to the eastern exposures of the Javelina Formation. This could indicate that the rate of subsidence in the basin was greatest on its eastern side. This formation is the oldest unit within the Tornillo Group, which ranges in age from the mid-middle Maastrichtian to the earliest Eocene. The Javelina Formation itself ranges from the mid-middle to late Maastrictian. Most vertebrate fossils are found in the upper half of the Javelina Formation. (Lehman et al., 2018) . Ankylosaur fossils have been recorded from the Javelina Formation; however, they are less abundant than other vertebrates (Lawson, 1976 ). ",

Osteological terminology (any terminology referring to skeletal elements such as their size, shape, and anatomical position on the organism) for the ankylosauria were taken from Coombs (1978) , Carpenter and Currie, (1990) , and Carpenter (2001) . Whereas most of the osteological terms used here are standard for any study on large herbivorous dinosaurs, special consideration must be paid to the ankylosauria because of their extensive dermal armor. Before the work of Scheyer and Sander (2004) little effort was made to create a consistent osteological vernacular to describe ankylosaur osteoderms. Additionally, ambiguous synonyms such as 'plate', 'scute', and 'osteoscute' were used interchangeably until Vickayous and Sire (2009) discouraged the use of such terms. Therefore, this study uses the terminology of Scheyer and Sander (2004) which was later expanded upon by Burns and Currie (2014) . The term osteoderm will be used to refer to any bony structure of the dermal skeleton which develops from the dermis of an organism. Median will refer to the position of the keel or apex relative to osteoderm itself, and medial, distal, and lateral will refer to the position of the osteoderm on the organism. Terms such as dorsal and ventral will be used to denote the plane of view on any image of illustration of a specimen. Terminology referring to bone texture follows (Hieronymus et al., 2009) . Morphological shape of osteoderms will be described using the terminology of Ford (2000) and Blows (2001) .",

In contrast, the term 'external' refers to the surface that is connected to the more external layer of skin known as the epidermis, which might have even been partially exposed above this layer. Osteoderms are defined has having a single cortex or cortices (which can be basal or external), which surrounds a core of varying composition.

Each scan produced several hundred image slices of the specimens which were then converted to 16 bit tiff files. The files were downloaded into Dragonfly ORS, a 3-D imaging program that which can stitch together the sliced images and create digital models of each osteoderm. By using the active contouring tool on Dragonfly to identify different bone textures the bone analysis tool was used to segment out the cortical and trabecular bone. In some cases, where the core of the osteoderms where made up of Haversian bone, the segmentation of the core and cortices had to be done manually, as the program could not distinguish between cortical and Haversian bone. Once the segmentation was complete the histology of each specimen could be studied. In terms of an osteologic study the size, morphology, and external texture of each osteoderm was noted and compared to known specimens from the Late Cretaceous of North America. The osteologic study also included axial or appendicular elements from ankylosaurs found in Big Bend. Comparisons were made based on descriptions in the literature and on specimens studied at the Vertebrate Paleontology Lab of the University of Texas at Austin, the University of New Mexico, and the American Natural History Museum in New York. Osteoderm characteristics were added to the latest character matrix assembled by Arbour and Currie (2015) and analyzed using the phylogenetic software Mesquite 3.61 (Maddison, W. P. and D.R. Maddison, 2019) . A phylogenetic tree using 50% majority consensus rule was created using this program and was then compared to the latest ankylosaur classification study conducted by Arbour and Currie (2015 Osborn (1923) defined the group Ankylosauria as a suborder sharing a common ancestry with the Stegosauria. Together they form the clade Thyreophora (Nopcsa, 1915) , but the time of divergence between these two groups is yet to be determined. The first appearance of ankylosaurs is believed to have occurred during the Early to Middle Jurassic. The thyreophorans Scelidosaurus and Scutellosaurus are believed to be the earliest members of the suborder, with Scelidosaurus considered the most basal ankylosaur (Carpenter, 2012) . This dinosaur had osteoderms similar to more derived ankylosaurs and showed evidence that the ilia of the pelvis had started to rotate to become more horizontal; unlike the condition in other ornithischians. The horizontal ilia would later come to be a synapomorphy for derived ankylosaurs (Carpenter, 2012) .",

These ankylosaurs are distinguished by small ossicles covering the dorsal part of their skull, grooved neck and distal spines, and osteoderms with uniformly thick external and basal cortices enclosing a trabecular core (Scheyer and Sander, 2004; Burns and Currie, 2014) . However, the best well-known North American polocanthine, Gargoyleosaurus, (Morrison Formation-Late Cretaceous) has a pelvic condition similar to the more derived ankylosaurs from the Cretaceous (Carpenter et al., 2013) . Due to a combination of both basal and derived characteristics it has been suggested to promote this group to its own family within the Ankylosauria (Carpenter and Currie, 1990) . By the Early Cretaceous, polocanthine diversity was ebbing, becoming extinct by the start of Barremian (129 Ma) and the ankylosaurs then diversified once again. These Cretaceous ankylosaurs were split into two families by Coombs (1978) : the Nodosauridae and the Ankylosauridae. Interestingly enough the disappearance of the polocanthines and the emergence of nodosaurids occurred simultaneously with the establishment of angiosperms. However, there is no direct correlation between these events to suggest cause and effect (Carpenter, 2012) .",

The most basal member of this group is Cedarpelta; the shamosaurines diversified during the Albian (113 Ma). It is hypothesized that ankylosaurids originated in North America during the Early Cretaceous and migrated to Asia where they further diversified into the sub-family Ankylosaurinae (Sereno, 1998) . This sub-family is characterized by complex cranial ornamentation (including squamosal horns which projected over the eye orbit), boney tail clubs, fully horizontal ilia which is also rotated outwards from the body, and a boxy skull with a tapered muzzle (Carpenter, 2012) .",

No ankylosaurines have been found in Europe or the Southern Hemisphere, suggesting that they had a more limited range then contemporary nodosaurids.

This feature would be very difficult to distinguish with the human eye given the pre-existing thinness of the cortices. The size and morphology of this osteoderm is typical of a medial cervical osteoderm, perhaps even part of a cervical half ring. Although the base of the osteoderm is highly concave, the thinness of the basal cortex, in relation to the thick trabecular core, is indicative of a nodosaurid (Scheyer and Sander, 2004) . Due to the sparseness of neurovascular grooves on the surface this specimen is more likely to be related to Edmontonia, and Panoplosaurus mirus than Glytodontopelta mimus. The oval shape of the osteoderm and concentration of pitting around the keel distinguishes this specimen as Panoplosaurus mirus which exhibits long sub-oval to oval cervical osteoderms compared to the square or rectangular cervical osteoderms of Edmontonia (Carpenter and Currie, 1990) . undergone extensive erosion to the point where the core of the osteoderm has been exposed. However, the erosion of the basal cortex reveals a large bifurcated vascular canal to be viewed in hand sample. Dorsal to the vascular canal the external cortex of the osteoderm projects laterally and is thickened at the base forming a small shelf. This region of the osteoderm would have been where the dermis and small muscles attached to the osteoderm to hold it in place. Figure 6 . The ventral side of TVP 45866-2 exhibits a smooth flat surface that is partially eroded (A).

The sacrum consists of a partial dorsal (pre-sacral) vertebra which is partially fused to the first sacral vertebra. The first and second sacral vertebrae have a pair of sacral ribs attached to them, however the shelf of the diapophyses, where the ribs attach is smooth resulting in some of the ribs having to be reattached to the sacrum using PaleoBond. Furthermore, there is no evidence that the distal edge of the sacral ribs had yet fused to the ilium. The neural arches of the sacral vertebrae are only a few centimeters high and are not fused together, which is a common condition in juvenile ankylosaurs of both families. The bones of the sacrum are either partially fused or not fused at all, another juvenile ankylosaur trait; as the animal grew the vertebrae and ribs would fuse to each other as the pelvis created a support system for a large heavy body (Coombs, 1978) The angle and width of the sacral ribs suggest that the ilia would have been in a horizontal position and would have been rotated slightly outward .This is a condition in derived ankylosaurids, and when compared to known ankylosaurinae the first sacral rib of the sacrum bears a remarkable resemblance to first sacral rib of Euoplocephalus sp (Carpenter 2012 and Carpenter et al., 2013) . A specimen of this taxa, AMNH 5337, which has been studied extensively in previous literature and was studied in person at the AMNH in New York, is the closest match when compared to both derived and basal ankylosaurs. ankylosaurs through time. This shows the evolution of the ankylosaur pelvis and the distinct pelvic characteristics of these six taxa. The Euoplocephalus tutus specimen is the same AMNH 5337 pelvis that is compared to TL-05-14. Note the differences between Euoplocephalus and Edmontonia. The Edmontonia specimen has two more pre-sacral ribs than Euoplocephalus, and the first sacral rib is fused to the acetabular process unlike the first sacral rib in Euoplocephalus. Futhermore, the ilia of Edmontonia have not undergone the degree of horizontal rotation observed in Euoplocephalus. It should be noted that in basal ankylosaurs and thyreophorans the ilia are vertically, as seen in Strombergia (basal thyreophoran). The degree of horizontal rotation of the ilia undergone by later taxa is a substantial characteristic which delineates basal ankylosaurids and nodosaurids from members of the ankylosaurinae. Figure 12 . The TL-05-14 sacrum (A) compared to the complete AMNH 5337 (B) shows not only the size difference between the two, but the unfused elements of the TL-05-01 sacrum to the fused elements of AMNH 5337. The unfused sacral ribs and neural arches of TL-05-01 are the juvenile condition in ankylosaurs, while the fusion of such elements such as in AMNH 5337 are the typical adult condition.

The fusion of the neural arches (na) to the centrum (c) indicate that this specimen came from a mature adult. The morphology of the specimen suggests it was close to the base of the skull, suggesting that it is a C1 or C2 vertebra. Vertebra #2 is a simialar size but has a different morphology. The spinous process (sp) is slightly longer than Vertebra #1, with almost horizontal transeverse processes (tp), and short diapohesys (d) are present in the specimen. Just as in the previous specimen the neural arches are fused to the centrum (c). The transverse process (tp) is not angled high enough to identify it as a dorsal vertebra. However, given the similar width and length of the centrum it is most likely a C7 or C8 cervical vertebra similar to the juvenile TL-05-14 specimen. The centra lack the hexagonal shape of a nodosaurid vertebra (Rivera-Sylva et al., 2011) , therfore it belongs to a member of the Ankylosauridae. Unfortunately, there is not enough distintion between the cervical vertebrae of ankylosaurs to assign the specimens to any genera without other associated skeletal elements. ",

                "text": "Radius #1 (Fig. 28) As in most ankylosaurs the radius is shorter and more robust than the ulna (Carpenter, 2012) . The shaft of the radius is straight as seen in anterior and posterior views. The proximal end of the radius is sub-oval in shape and is concave, this allows the radis to attach to the distal end of the humerus via the radial condyle of the humerus (Osi, 2005) . The distal end of the radius is also sub-oval in shape, however the anterior surfcae is wide and flat in anterior view. In posterior view the distal end of the radius exhibits muscle scaring on the posterior surface. The shape of the radius in cross-section is an identifying feature between ankylosaurids and nodosaurids; Coombs (1978) described the proximal and distal ends of the radius in ankylosaurids to oval shaped in cross-section while nodosaurids are known to have a more circular shape in cross-section. Due to the sub-oval shape of the radius in proximal and distal view it can be determined that this element came from an ankylosaurid. Brown found the skull in 1940 in the Aguja Formation. The specimen was missing the lower jaw and was broken in half at the base of the snout. The skull was determined to belong to the genus Edmontonia due to the smooth texture of the cranial osteoderms and the lack delineation between them (Carpenter and Currie, 1990) . In addition, whereas the skulls of Panoplosaurus mirus and Edmontonia sp are similar in size and shape, the muzzle is longer and narrower in Edmontonia. Because the skull is on display at the American Museum of Natural History it could not be removed for study. However, with the cooperation of the museum photos were taken of the specimen for use in this study. It should also be noted that Kenneth Carpenter and Philip Currie have described the specimen thoroughly in their joint publication Ankylosaur systematics: Example using Panoplosaurus and Edmontonia (Ankylosauria: Nodosauridae) .",

These openings lead to complex nasal passages in the skull above the secondary palate. It is theorized that the complex nasal passages in ankylosaurs were used as a heat regulation system (Bourke et al., 2018) . In fact, on the left side in ventral view the internal nares are exposed between the palatine (p) bone and the ectopterygoid bone (ec). The vomer (v) of Edmontonia appears as a thin ridge of bone between the two rows of alveoli.

The vertebra, labeled as CPC 275, consists of a centrum without the neural arch, spine, and transverse processes. The centrum has a hexagonal shape in posterior, which is indicative of a nodosaurid. The centrum is also short anteroposteriorly with a pair of chevron facets on the posteroventral edge (Rivera-Sylva et al., 2011) . Unfortunately, the genus cannot be identified by one lone centrum. The first locality in Baja, Mexico yielded one tooth from a mudstone interval in the El Gallo Formation (Campanian). The tooth is small (5 mm in width) and lacks a root but is wide with a shelf-like cingulum. This is the typical condition of most nodosaurid teeth (Coombs, 1990) . Fluting between marginal cusps are also observed on the tooth, which according to Coombs is also a major characteristic of nodosaurid teeth. The tooth, which is designated as UABC FCM 2625, has a six denticles on the labial side and three on the lingual side. (Rivera-Sylva et al., 2011) . This tooth is similar to that of Aletopelta coombsi which was identified as an ankylosaurid by Ford and Kirkland (2001) . However, Coombs and Demere (1996) originally described this ankylosaur as a nodosaurid. This is supported by tooth and osteoderm morphology observed by Kenneth Carpenter (Rivera-Sylva et al., 2011) .",

Ford (2000) published a review of ankylosaur osteoderms from New Mexico. In this review three taxa from the Late Campanian through the Late Maastrictian were identified. The nodosaurid Edmontonia was identified by two medial cervical osteoderms attached at the midline. This specimen was found in the Kirtland Formation (Maastrictian). The osteoderms were unfused and had a median keel which ended in a short conical point (Ford, 2000) . A pup-tent shaped osteoderm with an excavated base, believed to be from Nodocephalosaurus kirtlandensis was found in the De-na-zin member of the Kirtland Formation (Early Maastrictian) (Ford, 2000) . Lastly, the holotype of Glyptodontopelta mimus was described in this study from pelvic osteoderms. This specimen was found in the Naashiobito member of the Kirtland Shale (Maastrictian); this is also known as the Kirtland Formation (Ford, 2000) .",

The red node (Fig. 30) indicates where a split occurred within the Nodosauridae, splitting up many sister taxa, which does not occur in the Arbour and Currie (2015) tree. Additionally, the two Nodosaur taxa known from Big Bend, Panoplosaurus mirus and Edmontonia, are now grouped together as sister taxa. Just as in the 2015 study, the ankylosaurid sub-family Shamosaurinae is found to be valid, as the relationship between Shamosaurus scutatus and Gobisaurus domoculus as sister taxa is monophyletic. However, it should not be used to describe all early ankylosaurids since it does not contain the supposed basal member Cedarpelta billbeyhallorum and all other non-ankylosaurine ankylosaurids as documented by Carpenter (2012) . Arbour and Currie (2015) used the clade Ankylosaurini to classify the most derived members of the Ankylosaurinae. This includes Euoplocephalus sp. (a Big Bend ankylosaurid) and its many sister taxa as seen in Tree (A); however in Tree (B) Euoplocephalus sp. is seen to be basal to other Ankylosaurini taxa. The green node (Fig. 30) indicates where splitting within the Ankylosaurini begins; suggesting that Ankylosaurini is an invalid paraphyletic clade. An observation of note, Ziapelta sanjuanensis (a southern assemblage ankylosaur) is found to be closer to Ankylosaurus magniventris (a northern assemblage ankylosaur) than previously thought. This further suggests that the separation of Late Cretaceous faunal assemblages within North America might need revision. The revision of the Arbour and Currie (2015) ankylosaur phylogenetic tree using osteoderm characteristics supports the hypothesis proposed by Scheyer and Sander (2004) , and expanded upon by Hayashi et al. (2010) , that osteoderms are important elements in determining relationship at generic and specific levels.",

As a novel approach to paleohistoloy there is room for improvement as the technology is further developed, however it has proven to be an excellent alternative for more destructive methods. The findings of this study partially support the hypothesis of Scheyer and Sander (2004) that histologic and osteologic features of osteoderms can be used to determine relationship between taxa within the Ankylosauria. These finding are also conclusive with the results of Hayashi et al. (2014) and Burns and Currie (2014) . Using characteristics observed in the osteoderms the relationship between the sub-families Polocanthinae and Shamosaurinae to the rest of the Ankylosauria need further study and revision. In addition, the relationships between members of the Ankylosaurini were determined to be more complex than previously thought, as this group contains many paraphyletic branches. Due to this the sub-group of Ankylosaurini may need revision in the future. In this study it has been shown that osteoderms from juvenile ankylosaurs have a more complex histology than previously reported in the study conducted by Scheyer and Sander (2004) . This could account for the differences seen in the juvenile TMM 40484-46 osteoderm, which did not exhibit the typical characteristics of a nodosaurid osteoderm as outlined in the previous study. Osteoderms are still some of the least studied skeletal elements of any ankylosaur taxa, so continuing studies of this nature would continue to yield more information about ankylosaur systematics and classification.",

However, one group of herbivorous dinosaurs, the armored ankylosaurs, have never been described in detail from this area. Fossil remains of these dinosaurs are sparse and fragmentary; the only skeletal elements found in abundance are the dermal plates, known as osteoderms, that these animals utilized for defense and display. Previous studies such as Scheyer and Sander (2004) , Hayashi et al.

The left lateral view reveals the thickening of the cortical bone to form the shelf, and extensive pitting on the external surface (C). The right lateral view exhibits the low median keel of the osteoderm (D). this specimen is very complex and could not be segmented by the Dragonfly ORS program. Like most nodosaurids the basal and external cortices are thin compared to the core. The basal cortex makes up 32.3% of total osteoderm thickness, whereas the external cortex makes up 18.7% of the total thickness. The core itself consists mostly of trabecular bone, however, there is a region of Haversian bone in the center of the core which thickens towards the basal cortex. The overall thickness of the core is 49%. The border between the basal cortex and this region of Haversian bone is almost imperceivable as the Haversian tissue seems to grade into the cortical bone. The cortical bone of both cortices contains small reabsorption cavities. The specimen exhibits extensive pathways of vascular canals branching off laterally from one main feeder canal extending anteroposteriorly along the keel.Some of these blood vessels have begun to perforate (the first step in the process of osteon development), but no fully formed primary osteons are present. Lines of arrested growth were not found in the cortical bone; however, they may not be detectible in CT scans at this scale. These features indicate that the osteoderm was undergoing extensive secondary remodeling before the animal's death. The presence of trabecular and Haversian bone in the core, along with secondary remodeling of the osteoderm, indicate that the animal could have been a juvenile undergoing a period of growth. It is not uncommon for nodosaurid osteoderms to have Haversian bone in their cores Sander 2004, Burns andCurrie 2014"

FROM MEXICO AND NEW MEXICO The purpose of this section is to highlight other ankylosaur specimens from strata in Mexico and the Southwest that are time correlative to the Campanian and Maastrichtian units in Big Bend National Park.MexicoRivera-Sylva (2011) described recent discoveries of Upper Cretaceous nodosaurids. In total, five fossil sites were studied; two sites across the Rio Grande from Big Bend in Coahulia, one site inFigure 30. An illustration from KennethCarpenter (1990) of the AMNH 3076 skull in dorsal (A), ventral (B), and right lateral (C) views.Southeast Coahulia, one site in Chihuahua, and one site in Baja, Mexico. Material from the fourth locality was found in the Pen Formation (Early Campanian). It is likely that the nodosaurid material was transported here, as the Pen Formation consists of a marine shale. Designated as CPC 272, the specimens discovered include the distal end of a right humerus, a right ulna, a dorsal and caudal vertebra, the distal end of a femur, one rib fragment, and one osteodermal spine. Due to the fragmentary nature of these elements no definitive identification could be made(Rivera-Sylva et al., 2011). The third locality yielded specimens from a sandy mudstone interval within the Aguja Formation. This site yielded two caudal vertebrae, on cervical rib, six rib fragments, an ilium fragment, fragments of long bones, the proximal end of a scapula, thirteen osteoderms, as well as 27 unidentified bone fragments. Designated as CPC 273 the osteoderms are the most diagnostic of all material. The first osteoderm is rectangular with a median keel, that terminates in a tall conical apex towards the posterior margin of the osteoderm(Rivera-Sylva et al., 2011). Two other osteoderms have a similar morphology but are broken down the middle. The fourth osteoderm is a conical anterolaterally directed cervical spine. There are three thoracic osteoderms that are circular with a low median keel; and another which was identified as a distal thoracic osteoderm. Lastly, there is a caudal osteoderm and one circular ossicle.(Rivera-Sylva et al., 2011). The external texture of the osteoderms resembles that of Glyptodontopelta mimus; a smooth surface with extensive pitting and"

                "text": "the Allison member of the Menefee Formation (Early Campanian) the holotype of this ankylosaur (WSC 16505) includes fragments of dorsal ribs, six osteoderms, and additional fragments of osteoderms. The specimen had unique osteoderm characteristics not seen in any other ankylosaur. The entire external surface is pitted with the largest of the pits occurring along the caudal margin and the caudal end of the keel (McDonald and Wolfe, 2018). These rugosities appear between the pits on the keel, which diminish toward the caudal margin. Toward the cranial margin the pitting is continuous, however the area between the pits is smooth. The transition from pitted with rugosities to pitted without rugosities is what differentiates Invictarix zephyri from other ankylosaurs (McDonald and Wolfe, 2018). It is this texture that McDonald and Wolfe cite as their reason to placing this ankylosaur in the Nodosauridae. However, they only compared it to the nodosaurid Glyptodontopelta mimus in terms of osteoderm texture. The holotype shares osteoderm morphology with Anodontosaurus lambei and Aletopelta coombsi, so it is possible that further study is required for this ankylosaur. PHYLOGENETIC DISCUSSION A phylogenetic analysis was performed using a heuristic majority rule consensus on 45 taxa and 186 characteristics using Mesquite 3.61 (Maddison, W. P. and D.R.
