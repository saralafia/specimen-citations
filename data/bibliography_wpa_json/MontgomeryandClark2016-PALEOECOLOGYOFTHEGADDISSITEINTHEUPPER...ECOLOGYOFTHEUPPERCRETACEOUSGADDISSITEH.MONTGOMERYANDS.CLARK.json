The purpose of this investigation was to identify and describe the fossil communities as they changed through time in the lower part of the upper Aguja Formation at a previously unreported site. Special emphasis was placed on the diverse and occasionally exceptional fossil assemblages at the Gaddis site that differ from those at other Aguja Formation exposures. This study extends the paleoecological analysis of Montgomery and Barnes (2012) in the Javelina Formation into the underlying Aguja Formation as components of a project to analyze paleontologically diverse and data-rich Upper Cretaceous localities in west Texas.",

During the late Campanian the Aguja bonebed at the Gaddis site was probably located approximately 100 km from the shoreline (Atchley et al. 2004) . Depositional models for this lower part of the upper shale member of the Aguja depict a drying marsh-bay facies changing to a more terrestrial, swampy, inland floodplain (Lehman 1982 (Lehman , 1985 (Lehman , 1991 . Arid climatic conditions dried up standing water, and dinosaur remains near watering holes were exposed, trampled, and redeposited by periodic floods (Lehman 1982 (Lehman , 1989 Davies and Lehman 1989) . Slow rates of sedimentation yielded a generally condensed faunal history (Lehman 1985 (Lehman , 1991 .

At the base of the outcrop, a bed of dark red sandstone and unconsolidated silty sand is present on the south side of a covered interval approximately 300 m south of a Terlingua Creek Sandstone outcrop. Above the basal sandstone/sand layer the Gaddis site is similar in lithology to a site described by Sankey (2010) at Rattlesnake Mountain in Big Bend National Park (Fig. 1) The Gaddis site is generally unfossiliferous aside from four horizons that from oldest to youngest contain oysters and shark teeth; microvertebrates above logs with Teredolites borings and well-preserved dicotyledonous leaves; a bonebed that includes numerous mostly disarticulated ornithischian and theropod dinosaurs, crocodiles, turtles, fragments of unidentified vertebrates, coniferous logs, dicotyledonous vines, and thick mats of comminuted plant material; and a surface of small to large coprolites and hadrosaur vertebrae at the top of the exposure. This diverse collection of fossils provided evidence that was utilized in a paleoecological reconstruction documenting the change in faunas produced by an environmental shift from nearshore, shallow marine through floodplain swamp to dry land. The term ''dry land'' is used to refer to a surface that was also clearly covered with terrestrial plants as judged from the inclusions in coprolite surfaces. It remains unknown if this was a welldrained floodplain surface. The surface certainly does not meet the criteria for Sankey's (2001) description of an arid, well-drained floodplain in the Aguja Formation.",

The microvertebrates are an especially rich source of local information about the composition and ecology of the fauna below the dinosaur bonebed. While dinosaur remains are known from numerous areas in the Aguja Formation (Standhart 1986; Rowe et al. 1992; Weil 1992; Cifelli 1994; Sankey 1998 Sankey , 2001 Sankey and Gose 2001; Sankey et al. 2005; Nydam et al. 2014) , microsites are less common. The assemblage at the Gaddis microsite is somewhat dissimilar to those of other Aguja sites. The macrovertebrate assemblage is comprised of numerous taxa that also represent a relatively local fauna given evidence of minimal transport. The usual death, exposure, trampling, and redeposition model described from other Aguja sites (Lehman 1982 (Lehman , 1989 Davies and Lehman 1989) does not apply at the Gaddis site. The 24 coprolites at the Gaddis site are a highly unusual discovery as there is only one published description of a single dinosaur coprolite specimen from the Aguja Formation (Baghai 1996) . The coprolites at the Gaddis site provide evidence, with a modest degree of certainty, that most are probably of herbivorous dinosaur origin based on plant contents, and associated hadrosaur skeletal elements on the same surface. A theropod probably excreted one coprolite that contains a prominent bone fragment. The coprolites perhaps place herbivorous and carnivorous dinosaurs on a contemporaneous surface.",

The first run of nine liters of sample was washed on a 63-micron sieve. Because microscopic examination revealed no fossils in the finest fraction of these samples the subsequent 35 liters of material were washed on a 180micron sieve. In addition to bones, teeth, scales, shell, and coprolites, the sieved material contained abundant carbonized wood fragments, shredded leaf litter, amber globules, and gypsum. A Nikon SMZ 1500 binocular microscope was used to pick samples and to photograph specimens. Samples were picked from one-specimen-thick layers sprinkled on 70 3 100 mm picking trays. All microvertebrate elements were picked. No invertebrates were present. No search was conducted for protists in this investigations. Approximately 2,500 elements were recovered as determined by redundant counts using a dry microfossil splitter. Characteristics such as abrasion and fracturing were noted for each tray of specimens.

Aside from the mammals, no attempt was made to undertake systematic paleontology of the recovered specimens as the purpose of this investigation was simply to evaluate paleoecology within shifting paleoenvironments. Thus, taxa that convey ecological information were most important for our purpose. The identifiable microvertebrate assemblage (including all other elements present) is composed of the following elements in estimated percentages: gar (23.0%), other teleosts (15.0%), sawfish (10.0%), hybodont sharks (8.0%), bonefish (7.0%), other sharks (2.0%), pterosaurs (2.0%), crocodylians (1.0%), turtles (0.5%), amphibians (0.25%), mammals (0.25%), snakes (one tooth), bone fragments (7.0%), amber (5.0%), palm seeds (three), unknown (18.0%). The mammals are represented by Cimolomys sp., Cimolodon sp., Alphadon sp., and possible Mesodma sp., but all are exceedingly rare. Sankey (1998) described the taxonomically similar Talley Mountain multituberculate/marsupial fauna as Judithian. As shown in Table 1 , nonmarine aquatic fauna at the Gaddis site includes Albanerpeton sp. and Scapherpeton sp. both of which were reported by Sankey (2008) and Rowe et al. (1992) in the Aguja. Abundant aquatic fauna includes Lepisosteus sp. which may also have lived in an estuarine setting (Hoese and Moore 1977; Bryant 1987 Bryant , 1989 . Lepisosteus sp. teeth and scales are the most abundant elements in the assemblage. Fauna listed in Table 1 as marine are Paralbula sp., Hybodus sp., Ischyrhiza avonicola, Restesia americana, and Myliobatis(?) sp. Seeds of the palm Sabal bigbendense (Manchester et al. 2010) are present. Rare eggshell fragments of the oogenus cf. Continuoolithus? (Zelenitsky et al. 1996) were recovered.

Problematically, though, is that none of the hundreds of species of invertebrates commonly found in brackish bay environments are present in this outcrop. Given that a majority of these original inhabitants were probably soft-bodied, and many others were aragonitic, the taphonomic and diagenetic survivors would be calcitic. Also puzzling is the complete lack of foraminifers that would be expected to be present in a flourishing brackish bay setting. The presence of a silty matrix would argue against winnowing as a mechanism that might have removed foraminifers and other small, calcitic fossils. The fine fraction contains ubiquitous, highly degraded shell material. Perhaps foraminifera were not originally present, or they might have been dissolved at some point in a post-burial environment.",

The assemblage was likely reworked by transport, perhaps locally, as indicated by the severely broken and abraded nature of the oyster shells and the random, broken shark teeth. The oyster-encrusted hadrosaur tibia segment was conceivably the product of subaerial disarticulation, severe abrasion during both transport and probably following arrival on the oyster bank.

The mudstone was dominated by tabular, low density components such as cycloid scales and fish vertebrae, and the sandstone contained mostly highdensity, equidimensional elements such as teeth, ganoid scales, and turtle shell fragments. The implication of this research is that the abundance of ganoid scales, teeth, and numerous other equidimensional elements would be expected in sandstone matrix rather than enclosed in the silty mudstone of the microsite lens at the Gaddis site.",

Microelements were transported and sorted by low energy tidal processes although the few broken and/or abraded larger size fraction (. 10 mm) probably had a different depositional history from that of the smaller sized-fraction (, 5 mm). The disarticulated assemblage was sorted and transported a short distance whereupon it collected in a slight topographic low. This attritional assemblage is apparently a collection from several adjacent communities, a sampling process described by Behrensmeyer (1982) . Evidence suggests that the microvertebrate communities collected in this lens would have originated predominantly in nearshore, shallow non-marine to marine waters as well as being washed in from adjacent terrestrial environments (Table 1) . Thus, the taphonomic histories of the components in the microvertebrate lens appear to be complex. It is suggested that the few large and abraded elements (hadrosaur caudal centra, ankylosaur dermal bone, and a juvenile crocodilian centrum) were perhaps transported into the lens by bank slumping or a similar process as there is no evidence of a current sufficient to move these larger specimens.",

Longitudinal fractures, those parallel to the long axis of a long bone, are rare, and they are present mostly on hollow long bones.

The area was perhaps a swamp as indicated by the presence of copious leaf material and logs distributed in churned mud. These logs are all unbored, quite unlike logs in the Teredolites layer. Paleoenvironmental associations noted for various species present in the Gaddis bonebed include the presence of Agujaceratops mariscalensis within coastal floodplains (Sankey 2010 ) that were likely densely vegetated and marshy. The bonebed at the Gaddis site was likely an interdistributary swamp following the description of Lehman (1982) in the Aguja Formation gray mudstone with dinosaurs that are disarticulated but have not been winnowed. Plant remains are abundant. Other possibilities are that the interval may have been deposited as an overbank deposit or even in a lacustrine environment.

None of the three bones is cracked or broken to an extent that would suggest the culprit was a powerful adult. It is unknown why bites would be present on the ankle. Perhaps the predator was moving the prey. Additionally, the essentially complete cervical string of this animal shows no evidence of predation that, if perforated, might be an indication of predation by a theropod. No evidence of healing is present, so the injuries were inflicted either immediately pre-death or post mortem. As this hadrosaur was an adult, it is assumed that the predator was large.

A fourth bone is a juvenile hadrosaur femur, and again, the teeth marks are small and not especially deep. One juvenile hadrosaur tibia has bite marks running transversely across the bone (Fig. 10) . The laterally compressed dentary or maxillary teeth of theropods may have produced V- shaped grooves and small oval punctures. Shed theropod teeth from multiple locations in the macrovertebrate layer fit precisely into these grooves and punctures. A section of a medium-sized hadrosaur femur is shattered and torn away on both ends in what appears to be the result of gnawing, but it remains unclear whether a theropod or a crocodile inflicted this damage. A juvenile ceratopsian femur shows evidence of tooth marks by a possible raptor based on the precise fit of a tooth in the groove. Small marks are approximately 2.5 mm wide and 1 mm deep. We sought to discover why so many diverse, disarticulated bones in the southeast pit ended up in this apparent swamp. Deposition of the upper Aguja occurred during a time of warm temperatures and a relatively high sea level stand (Atchley et al. 2004) . As there is no evidence of fish or invertebrate occupation, this presumed swamp is assumed to have been ephemeral and more of a depression filled with muddy water and plant debris than a persistent pond. It also may have dried seasonally, but there is no local carbonate cementation or pedogenic nodule evidence. Abundant fossil remains suggest the presence of at least periodic, and occasionally large populations of dinosaurs in the area.",

A hypothetical mechanism for accumulation of this skeletal assemblage is having turtles drag various disarticulated, but not completely defleshed, carrion elements into the swamp.

Almost certainly, those that were able would have reacted by fleeing. Given their limited mobility, young are more vulnerable to injury and death in this situation than are mature animals (Smith 2000) . Although speculative, wildfire may have caused or contributed to the high percentage of juvenile versus adult dinosaurs in the bonebed (Lyon et al. 2000) .

The one coprolite containing bone (A10) probably cannot be associated with crocodiles that are clearly present in the bone bed below this level. Baghai-Riding and DiBenedetto (2001) noted that crocodilian feces have a characteristic ''corkscrew appearance''. Neither coprolite A10 nor any other Gaddis site coprolites have a corkscrew morphology. None exhibit the sausage-like sphincter imprints described by Schwimmer (2002) from Hannahatchee Creek, Georgia as being possible Deinosuchus coprolites although he also noted amorphous shapes as being possible candidates. All of the coprolites were apparently deposited on a wellvegetated surface as indicated by the impressions and shallow incorporation of ferns, stems, and other ground cover on the surfaces of the coprolites that only a freshly deposited dropping would incorporate.

                "text": "Plant materials in thin sections include woody components encapsulated within the coprolites. A comparison may be found in the Upper Cretaceous Two Medicine Formation of Wyoming. As discussed by Chin (2007) , woody material is eaten on a regular basis by a range of vertebrates that includes elephants, deer, beaver, and turtles. Ingestion of woody material increases during times of the year when a dearth of nitrogen-rich food items occurs (Mattson 1980) . Until more definitive data are obtained, one possibility among many is that the abundant amber throughout the bonebed was an original byproduct of dinosaur-induced damage to woody plants during a similar time of year. All thin sections include dispersed silt and sand-sized mineral grains perhaps incorporated during regular consumption of food items on the ground. Chin (2007) associated the Two Medicine coprolites with Maiasaura based on size, composition, and context. Maiasaura are common to that area, and they possessed dental batteries capable of reducing wood to the pulverized state observed in thin section of these coprolites. Chin (2007) also noted that dinosaurs for which there is little or no skeletal evidence might have produced other specimens. The Aguja coprolite of Baghai-Riding and DiBenedetto (2001) had dimensions of 15 3 9 3 12 cm, a size that is similar to several of the Gaddis specimens, but certainly smaller than the larger ones presented in this report. Baghai-Riding and DiBenedetto (2001) suggested that coprolite was produced by a large herbivorous dinosaur. Given the abundance of hadrosaurs in the underlying macrovertebrate bed, and the presence of two hadrosaur centra on the coprolite surface, there is circumstantial evidence that at least some of the coprolites might have been produced by these herbivores although the possibility remains that particularly the smaller coprolites may have been produced by a range of animals. The one coprolite containing bone (A10) is of possible carnivore origin although the prey item remains unidentified.",

The diverse macrovertebrate bed documents predation/scavenging on several animals by perhaps several predators and/or scavengers. The southeast macrovertebrate bed also includes a record of flash fires and the resulting dearth of adult animals that apparently fled more readily than did the young.
