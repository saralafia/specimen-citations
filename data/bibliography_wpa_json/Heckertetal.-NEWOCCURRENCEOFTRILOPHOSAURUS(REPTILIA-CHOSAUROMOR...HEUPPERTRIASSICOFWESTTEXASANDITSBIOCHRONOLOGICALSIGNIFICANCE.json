Kirby identified Trilophosaurus from the Owl Rock Formation near Wards Terrace in north-central Arizona. These records were based on an isolated tooth and several fragmentary skull bones. We concur that the incomplete tooth, MNA V7064, could represent Trilophosaurus, but it also closely resembles Tricuspisaurus, a possible procolophonid known from fissure fills of similar age in Britain (Robinson, 1957; Fraser, 1986) . In particular, MNA V7064 and Tricuspisaurus are less transversely broad than referred specimens of Trilophosaunts, and thus more closely resemble teeth of procolophonids. Further, MNA V7064 is incomplete, and the presence of a third cusp, while probable, can only be inferred. If this specimen does pertain to Trilophosaurus, it represents the smaller of two body morphs, as it would be less than 2 rom wide were it complete (Gregory, 1945) .",
