Since then, work has been done by four separate archaeological projects in and around the site, including the current Lubbock Lake Project. However, until the present investigations began only Sellards (1952) and Green (1962) had published on their previous work. The earlier paper dealt only with the Folsom material while the latter work was a very general treatment aimed at the general public. The Lubbock Lake Project is a research program being carried out under the auspices of The Museum of Texas Tech University and supported by the National Science Foundation, Texas Historical Commission, and the City and County of Lubbock. One of the first goals of the project was to bring together as much information as possible concerning the earlier work at the site and correlate this information with the work done during the first field season of the project. These goals were attained and the correlations were published in a symposium volume edited by Black (1974) .",

During the course of the work of the Lubbock Lake Project it has been determined, however, that the Lubbock Lake site covers at least 110 acres on the surface and is generally at least 20 feet deep ( Fig. 1 ). Of this acreage, all of the excavations since the late 1930's and through the summer of 1976 have removed less than 1%, in volume, of the site. In addition, the emphasis of the investigations has been on the earlier levels (Paleoindian deposits), although the more recent deposits have received some study. Nevertheless, the detailed archaeological and geological investigations of the Lubbock Lake Project and the radiocarbon sequence that is beginning to develop, combined with data recovered by previous investigators, provide the basic information necessary for the establishment of a cultural chronology, however preliminary, for the Lubbock area. As a frame of reference, the previous investigations at the Lubbock Lake site and pertinent archaeological work on the Llano Estacado are summarized and the nature and scope of the Lubbock Lake Project presented. The chronology, in its present form, is described. This presentation includes a discussion of the lithic artifact inventory, the regional relationships of the diagnostic artifacts, and specific chronological information provided by radiocarbon determinations. The concluding statements are a discussion of the major chronological problems and possible solutions.",

Most of the work was conducted in the upper deposits due to the high water table at the time. However, one long trench was excavated (Trench A), extending to the southwest of the reservoir and continuing to the edge of the valley fill (Fig. 2) . Excavations reached the Archaic deposits but not the strata bearing extinct fauna. The results of this work were summarized in a W.P.A. report (Wheat, 1939) and more recently by Wheat (1974) . Kelley (1974) This work continued in 1948 work continued in , 1950 work continued in , and 1951 work continued in (Holden, 1974 Kelley, 1974; Sellards, 1952) . The field work was conducted by Grayson Meade and Glen L. Evans, Five strata were identified. Most of the work consisted of cleaning the walls of the reservoir cut with more intensive investigations conducted at various \"stations\" along the walls (Fig. 2) . Almost all of the work was concentrated in the Paleoindian deposits. Among other discoveries, several Folsom points were found in association with extinct bison (Bison antiquus). A unifacial composite tool was found in a fluvial sand unit below the Folsom level. Mammoth (Elaphas cf. columbi) remains were also recovered in the sands but the association of the mammoth and the tool is uncertain. One of the most significant results of the work of the Texas Memorial Museum and a landmark in early man studies in North America was the determination of the first radiocarbon date for the Folsom period. The date was computed by Willard Libby (1955) in 1950 from charred bison remains associated with lithic artifacts from what was believed to be a Folsom level. The resulting date was 9883 + 350 years B.P. (Sellards, 1952) . In 1955, an additional date was secured from snail shells and was calculated at 9700 + 450 years B.P. (Broecker and Kulp, 1957) , The work of the Texas Memorial Museum was briefly reported by Sellards (1952) and a description of the artifacts given by Kelley (1974) . The accession records and various field notes and drawings are on file at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, The University of Texas, Austin.",

Of these sites, Blackwater Draw, Locality #1 (Hester, 1972) is one of the most well known archaeological sites in North America. Similar to the Lubbock Lake site in its stratigraphy and cultural sequence, 25 different field projects have investigated the site. A further and unfortunate similarity between the two sites is that relatively little has been published on the work. Hester (1972) attempted to synthesize all of the past work. Since the site is now virtually destroyed, little additional work can be done. However, some recent testing has taken place along the margins of the site (Agogino, et al., 1976; Stephens, 1973) . The similarities between Blackwater Draw, Locality #1 and the Lubbock Lake site makes the former one of the most important sites on the Llano Estacado in terms of work done at the Lubbock Lake site.",

Sites in this area are from the Antelope Creek Focus of the Panhandle Aspect. More archaeological work has been carried out on this stage of aboriginal occupation of the Llano Estacado than any other period, with the exception of the Paleoindian period. Collins (1971) provided information on the work conducted in this cultural period through the time of his writing. The only published report since then is Keller's (1975) monograph. Collins (1971) also summarized two interesting problems concerning Southwestern influences on the Llano Estacado. One question involved the previously mentioned study by Corley (1965) of an eastern variety of the Jornada branch of the Mogollon. The other, more puzzling, problem was that of Plains artifacts found in association with Puebloan pottery. This phenomenon occurs at the Lubbock Lake site and will be discussed in more detail below.",

The three dates provide a bracket for the age of FA6-8 which is in line with Wheat's (1972:156-157) range of dates for the Folsom horizon.",

However, it is possible that the bone bed from which the dates were secured may not have been the result of a Folsom occupation. The Lubbock Lake Project excavators have done some testing in the area from which the dated bone came (Evans and Meade's station M, Fig. 2 ) and encountered what is probably a part of the same bone bed (FA5-5). The substratum in which this feature was found is 2B, the diatomaceous earth, and not 2A, the diatomite (E. Johnson, 1976a:132) . This would suggest that the feature is of the late Paleoindian age (Plainview?) rather than Folsom age.",

Both Wheat (1972, 1976) and Wormington (1957) have discussed the problems of late Paleoindian projectile point typology. Wheat's (1972) study of the taxonomy of points from the Olsen-Chubbock site is a fine history of the classification of some of the late Paleoindian points.

Unfortunately, the present location of this specimen is not known as it was returned to the collector. A plaster cast was made, but all that remains is the tip which is quite worn. One photograph ( Fig. 8 ) and a set of line drawings were also made. All of these items are stored at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL). Originally described as a \"Portales-like\" point, Kelley (1974:52) referred to the artifact as a Plainview point. As Wheat (1972:153) noted, the Portales complex as defined by Sellards (1952:72-74) is rather anomalous, containing a variety of distinctly different projectile point forms (including Plainview, Firstview, Agate Basin, and the nowdefunct San Jon). To term a point \"Portales-like\" is to say nothing more than that it is similar to these point types, the principal attributes being a lanceolate outline and a lenticular to diamond shaped cross section. Based on the published drawing (Kelley, 1974: 54), the point (TMM 892-69) resembles a Plainview, with parallel sides, a concave base, and basically irregular flaking. A comparison of this drawing with the existing photograph and drawings on file at TARL reveals, however, that the published drawing is inaccurate. The point definitely has a straight base and exhibits finer flaking. The point seems to conform to Wheat's (1972) Firstview variety, at least in outline. The cast that remains has a lenticular cross section and apparently a rounded medial ridge as does Firstview. The flaking does not appear to be as fine as most of the Firstview points from the Olsen-Chubbock site (Wheat, 1972) . However, in discussing the \"Portales complex\" material of Sellards (1952) , Wheat (1972:146-147 ) assigned a number of these points to the Firstview variety. One of the points (Sellards, 1952:73, Fig. 37d that described by Wheat (1976) for points being reused as butchering tools.",

Interestingly, Green's I age estimate was based on his work at the Lubbock Lake site (1962) and I his determination that the stratum from which his Garza points came (5A) dated before A.D. 1500 age (Runkles, 1964:123) . The current evidence, principally radiocarbon, indicates that this projectile point tradition extends into the Historic period. A beginning date for the Garza tradition is uncertain. The Garza points from Green's (1962: 119, 120) lower occupation in substratum 5A (correlated to the Lublock Lake Project's FA8-4) may indicate that Garza points were present in the area in Ceramic times and, therefore, present before the postulated arrival of the Apache about A.D. 1525 (Gunnerson, 1960) . The Garza point may be characteristic of or at least adopted by a particular Apache band that inhabited the Southern Plains. Runkles (1964: 123-125) Runkles (1964) .",

Two of the points Fig. 7; Fig. 8,c)  were found on the fresh dump piles shortly after the original dredging of the site. The discovery of these two points, in part, brought scientific attention to the importance and potential of the site in the late 1930's. During the course of the excavations by the Texas Memorial Museum, near stations I and D (Fig. 1), four Folsom points 71, 77, Figs. 9,f, b,, missing from the collections) were found in situ in the lower diatomite, and associated with extinct bison (Bison antiquus). In addition, two more points4, Figs. 9, e, c)    were found in the dredge material. In 1954, another Folsom point (TTU-55-27,Fig. 9, a) was found in situ by a Boy Scout and examined by staff members of the West Texas Museum before it was removed(Kelley, 1974:50-51). One other Folsom point is known to have been recovered by a local collector from the dredge material. The points recovered in situ were found along the east and southeast wall of the site. The two surface finds made at this time were from the south side of the site. The association of the \u00b1n_ situ artifacts (Texas Memorial Museum work) with extinct bison is clearly documented. Nevertheless, little in known concerning the nature of the bone beds per se. Parts of a bone bed in the lower diatomite are visible in this area of the site. However, beyond very limited testing, the current project has not investigated this feature. Work has been conducted, however, in what is believed to be Folsom occupational layers in Area 5 and 6, on the west side of the site(Fig. 5). In Area 6, a large feature (FA6-8) has been exposed what represents a kill/butchering locale(Johnson, 1976:127). Butchered remains of at least two bison have been recovered. Bones of the animals were placed in distinctive piles. A number of bone tools have been identified, and a butchering tool (TTU-A 2655) and a number of flakes, all of Edwards Plateau chert, have been recovered among the bone piles. The assignment of FA6-8 to the Folsom occupation is based principally on stratigraphic and radiocarbon associations. The feature is located in the lowest major organic lamination of the diatomite. A date of 10,880 + 85 years B.P. (SMU 292) was obtained on snails from the Area 6 basal diatomite that immediately underlies the organic layer in which FA6-8 is located. The other date of 10,531 + 86 years B.P. (SMU 285) is on humates from the lowest diatomite member in Area 2 on the northeast side of the site. A date of 10,063 + 74 years B.P.

This artifact, then, is tentatively considered to be of the Firstview type.The point recovered by Fig 9, k)  has been heavily reworked along all edges. The remaining original flake scars reflect good workmanship, although not the high quality transverse and colateral flaking seen on some specimens of this period. The relationship of the flaking and thickness to the projected width, usingWheat's (1972:148-149)  indices of projectile point relative thickness, indicates an artifact along the lines of Firstview.Howevery since the original shape is unknown, some of the nonparallel sided varieties such as Agate Basin and Milnesand should also be considered.As noted above, portions of three late Paleoindian projectile points have been found in situ by the Lubbock Lake Project, as well as a redeposited, possible late Paleoindian projectile point. Artifact TTU-A7563 (Fig. 9, g) is apparently the midsection of a point, made from a chert of unknown source. This specimen is from FA6-5, a camping locality situated stratigraphically at the contact of substrata 2B/2C. The item is straight sided and lenticular in cross section, approaching a medial ridge. Flaking is irregular collateral As with the point recovered byGreen (1962), a definite assignment to a typological category is impossible since the overall dimensions and morphology are unknown. However, the relative-thickness, the flaking, and the parallel sides are typological indicators. Some variety of the Firstview complex(Wheat, 1972)  appears to be the best possibility.Artifact TTU-A19285(Fig. 9, j)is apparently the base of a projectile point. This item was also found in FA6-5. The material is a Tecovas quartzite. The relatively poor quality of this material probably contributed to the shape of the artifact. The specimen has parallel sides, a slightly concave base, and both lateral and basal grinding. In cross section, this artifact appears to be bev-eled along the right edge. Flake scars are difficult to see due to the nature of the material. This item may have been broken during manufacturing, and represents an unfinished point (H. M. Wormington, personal communication). It also exhibits some reworking along the edges and may have been used as a butchering tool.Artifact TTU-18464 (Fig. 9, i)is the midsection and distal end of a projectile point. This item comes from FA6-11, a bison kill/ butchering locale in the cienega zone at the base of substratum 2B, just above the 2A contact in Area 6. The specimen seems to be parallel sided, although one edge and possibly the other has certainly been reworked. Some evidence of lateral grinding remains just above the break. The point is lenticular in cross section and relatively thin. Flaking is irregular parallel. Although the base is missing, the observable characteristics fall within the range of the Plainview type (R. Knudson and J. B. I^eat, personal communication).

Associations with specific cultures or stratigraphic horizons are impossible, but these artifacts give some suggestions of the presence of certain cultural complexes. Two of the surface finds are almost certainly from the late Paleoindian period. The \"Yuma\" point (TMM 892-1,Fig. 8, a), one of the original surface discoveries in 1938, is a broken and apparently reworked mid-section. The original point has been lost. The plaster cast is of poor quality and flat on one side, presumably to aid in mounting it for display purposes. However, a good set of drawings and a photograph are on file at TARL. The specimen is parallel sided with some indication of a shoulder, possibly produced by heavylateral grinding. The collateral flaking is very good, giving the point a pronounced medial ridge. The cast displays a relatively thick cross section, almost half as thick as the item is wide. Because of the collateral flaking and thick cross section with pronounced medial ridge, the Eden variety of projectile points would be the most likely typological category. Two surface finds from this cultural period were made during the work of the Texas Memorial Museum. Figure 9, n illustrates a virtually complete projectile point lacking only the base. The l-,^ X artifact (TMM 892-85) has strongly convex sides widest at about > (/I the middle of the point. The stem exhibits heavy lateral grinding. _^ Flaking is relatively crude. Because of these features, this artifact could fall within the range of the Agate Basin type. The remaining surface find (TMM 892-73), (Fig. 9, ra) is difficult to classify. The base is broken and one side and the distal end have been reworked. The other side is slightly concave and exhibits some } lateral grinding towards the bottom. The specimen is lenticular in cross section and relatively thick. The slight concavity alongthe one side suggests a Plainview variety that is constricted just above the base then expands to about the mid section(Sellards, et al., 1947:960, Plate 5,Fig. 1). However, the relative thickness of this artifact is not typical of the Plainview variety in general.The three projectile points recovered by the Lubbock Lake Project come from the same excavation area (Area 6) and the exact strati-graphic relationships are known.

A variety of small animal remains and clusters of bison bones were also recovered. The small animal remains and the great amount of lithic debris would suggest a camping area.

The exact relationship of the bison remains to the camping debris has yet to bedetermined. A Tecovas quartzite knife (TTU-A13401, Fig. 10, b) with strongly beveled sides was recovered in FA6-5.

The I Plainview occupation is considered to be at the early part of the range in time occupied by the Firstview complex with Firstview points themselves continuing to about 9,000 years B.P. However, at the Lubbock Lake site, the two possible Firstview complex projectile point fragments are associated with radiocarbon dates of about 8,000 years B.P. Additional radiocarbon determinations and good associations with diagnostic artifact types are needed to clarify the problem. A Firstview occupation is certianly well demonstrated by the point recovered in 1949 during the work of the Texas Memorial Museum. Unfortunately, however, the exact stratigraphic provenience of this artifact is in question and the relationship of the stratigraphy in the area to the rest of the site is not yet certain. The surface finds of the Texas Memorial Museum also suggest the presence of an Agate Basin occupation and a Cody complex occupation (evidenced by a possible Eden point fragment). Although Agate Basin occupations are common throughout the Plains, the Cody complex has been considered a northern Plains tradition contemporaneous with the Firstview complex. The Cody complex, however, is not restricted to the northern Plains and some evidence of the presence of this culture"

A profile (Green, Field notes) shows the hearth near the edge of the reservoir cut and perhaps some contamination occurred or the material (bone) may have contributed to the youthfulness of the date (Herbert Haas, personal communication)."

In area 15 (Fig. 5), just south of the main work area, a pit originating in the 5A sands but cutting into the 4C soil was found during the course of machine testing operations. The pit -H rn contained hearth debris. A Garza type projectile point (TTU-A3320, X Fig. 11, f), some lithic flakes, and broken bison bones were asso-1X1 ciated with the pit. A radiocarbon determination of A.D. 1665 + 60 (S.I. 2703) was secured from the hearth debris. To the north of the site, in Area 14 (Fig. 5), a hearth was located during the course of archaeological monitoring of pipeline construction by Pioneer Natural Gas Company. Another Garza point (TTU-A3283, Fig. 11, h) and a number of lithic flakes were found around and within the hearth (Johnson, 1975:4). Charcoal from the hearth yielded a date of A.D. 1635 + 50 (S.I. 2704). The stratigraphic position of this hearth is not certain but it is probably from the 5A sands. Two small Contact period features have been investigated in Area 4 (FA4-2 and FA4-3). FA4-2 consisted of some scattered, butchered bison remains and several stone tools including a Lott point (TTU-A2122,Fig. 11, c). FA4-3 is stratigraphically below FA4-2.This feature consisted of a shallow, unlined, basin-shaped hearth with a few associated lithic items and some bone. A radiocarbon date on charcoal from the hearth was \"modern\" (S.I. 2702). The hearth had been exposed in an erosional channel for some time before it was excavated and the charcoal may have been contaminated. The -I assessment of an Historic age for both features is based on the geology. On the southwestern side of the site, including Area 4, a small, filled, erosional channel has been observed. This channel is at least post-5A in age since it cuts through substratum 5A.Both FA4-2 and FA4-3 are within this channel fill and therefore of post-5A age, placing them in the Historic period.The remaining Contact period features are FA5-1 and FA5-6.

The same problem, although to a lesser degree, exists within the Clovis period. Again, association of diagnostic material with the mammoth processing station would clarify the situation.

The Historic period presents some intriguing problems concerning the identification of the historic occupants of the area. A number of features have already been identified for this period. The unique situation of having a well-stratified and dated sequence of late Ceramic, contact and late Historic features provides an opportunity to study the Historic period in detail. A careful study of the archaeological information combined with ethnohistorical investigations ;\"' may make it possible to identify the presence of specific historic ^^ aboriginal groups in the area and perhaps trace their movements into -| and out of the region. In addition to the problems within each time period, there are j \u2022'\u2022\u2022\u00ab several general areas of investigation that would help in clarifying the overall cultural chronology for the area. Additional radiocarbon assays are mandatory in order to establish a more detailed temporal framework for both archaeological and geological purposes. Additional paleoenvironmental data for all periods would provide information on the nature of the area at specific times, and identify environmental changes that may affect existing populations. An important specific investigation along these lines would be the determination of the nature and age of various soil forming intervals. The stratigraphic manifestations of these intervals, principally the A horizons, are more likely to contain evidence of human occupation because of their stability. An important problem, then, would be the presence of im x: occupational debris within a stratigraphic unit that represented a long period of time. There are a number of major problems yet to be solved at the Lubbock Lake site, many of which are being pursued by the present investigators. The potential exists to solve others through future research. The cultural chronology presented herein provides a framework within which to conduct these future investigations. Although the chronology is certain to change as a result of additional work, it provides a basis on which to build the first detailed record of the past 12,000 years in the Lubbock area. This chronology, in turn, forms the basis on which to build a needed regional cultural chronology for the Llano Estacado. Once a regional chronology is established, it will then be possible to study culture process on the Southern High Plains and the nature and effect of the environment on this process.

The former are generally located some distance from Lubbock (at least 50 miles and generally more) but do provide good materials. The gravel deposits, of Pleistocene age, were probably common in the area before Holocene deposition began filling the drainage ways.Within these gravels a variety of materials were available, though apparently in limited quantity (Charles A. Johnson II, personal communication). The most common material found is a medium to fine grained chert from the Edwards formation of the Cretaceous. This chert ranges in color from a light gray to dark blue-gray as well as a medium to dark caramel brown, sometimes referred to as \"jasper\". For flint working this material is generally good to excellent. This chert is quite common in Central Texas owing to the many exposures of the Edwards formation limestone and because of the relative abundance of the chert in the limestone. In the Lubbock area, though, there are no such exposures. As far as is known the nearest exposure of \"typical\" Edwards chert is near San Angelo, Texas in Tom Green County (James A. Word, personal communication), about 200 miles southeast of Lubbock. However there are some Cretaceous outcrops nearer to Lubbock that do produce some chert though generally not as fine a quality as the Central Texas material. These are near Fluvanna, Texas in Scurry County and Gail, Texas in Borden County (John P. Brand, personal communication), approximately 70 miles southeast and south-southeast of Lubbock respectively."

The locality is on the Llano Estacado, or southern High Plains of Texas. An essentially flat, extensive plateau, the region is dissected by a number of northwest-southeast trending draws of which Yellowhouse Draw is one of the major ones. It now heads in Cochran and Hockley counties, Texas; although in earlier times it may have headed south of Clovis, New Mexico. Yellowhouse Draw joins with Blackwater Draw (several miles downstream from the Lubbock Lake site) in central Lubbock County, becoming Yellowhouse Canyon.
