In the quest to provide a more complete picture of the changes experienced in the different regions, the past two decades has witnessed an increase in long term palaeoenvironmental studies in a number of different disciplines. This has provided a more reliable assessment of the nature and scale of natural variability of the Earth's climate system, as well as the extent of human impacts on the present and future climate.",

The opportunity to return to a study within the transitional rainfall zone of South Africa, which has laid the foundation for many studies since its publication, can present a quantitative view and offer added insight to a region that has had few feasible sites to study. Initial work on a coastal lake near Knysna by Martin (1956 Martin ( , 1959 Martin ( , 1962 Martin ( and 1968 identified sediments rich in fossil materials, which spanned most of the Holocene epoch. This is an exceptional resource in the southern African context as the continuous accumulation of lake sediments is very rare (Scott and Lee-Thorp, 2004) . The lake, Groenvlei, has shown alterations in its chemical and biological development through the Holocene which Martin (1959) attributed to possible marine transgressions at various times over the last few thousand years. The potential of the Groenvlei sediments to be rich in diatom fossils had already been demonstrated in Martin's work (1959) ; therefore revisiting this site to further study sediment chrono-stratigraphy and fossil diatom assemblage is a potentially rewarding exercise.",

As a result, the palaeolimnological record should not suffer from time lags, as it is a direct, sensitive and powerful tool for palaeohydrologic and palaeoclimatic reconstructions (Fritz, 1990 ). An important factor to consider is a lake's hydrological sensitivity to any changes that do occur (Fritz et aI., 1999) , as an individual lake's response is related to both the lake and the catchment morphometry, local hydrology and the position of the lake within the landscape (Anderson, 1995) . However, the stability of the sediments and their resistance to erosion by such physical processes as tidal currents, wind-induced waves and bioturbation (Sullivan, 1999) allows for the use of palaeolimnology as a tool in identifying probable causes in change, either by reconstructing the history of individual sites or by the comparison between sites (Battarbee, 1999) .",

Surface water hydrology, for example lake isolation or open versus closed basin, is not always the main cause behind changes to lake levels (Anderson, 1995) but can also be a function of a variety of geological, biological or climatic processes (Wolin and Duthie, 1999) . However, in general, lake levels increase during wet periods and decline in drier periods leading to knock on effects on such parameters as thennal stratification, with the total loss of stratification and the resuspension of bottom sediments occur in shallow systems; in addition to increases in nutrient and chemical salt concentration with corresponding changes in pH (Wolin and Duthie, 1999) .

These activities can alter or obscure the climatic signal present in the sedimentary record; by separating the anthropogenic signal from the natural, a clear indication of human versus natural modifications can be detennined (Wolin and Duthie, 1999) . Therefore changes in the hydrologic budget either natural or anthropogenic will affect physiological responses and species composition of the lake's biota (Fritz ct aI., 1999) . The microfossil record preserved in the sediments is used to identify early changes in the biological record, as the extent of these changes can be used to reconstruct changes in water quality; in particular diatom analysis is now sufficiently well established to allow for quantitative reconstructions (Battarbee, 1999) .",

Diatoms are typically abundant and diverse, occurring in a broad spectrum of lake trophic status (Hall and Smol, 1999) , have high species diversity and niche habitat (Fritz et al., 1999) . On an individual species level, each has a specific habit and water chemistry requirement (Hall and Smol, 1999) . These requirements have allowed for diatoms to be used as a tool to explore and interpret many ecological and practical problems (Stoem1er and Smol, 1999) . Their sensitivity to different aquatic environments lead to their use as indicator organisms which reflect the ecological changes experienced (Wolin and Duthie, 1999) , and allow for the changes to be tracked as algal productions shifts in response (Hall and Smol, 1999) .",

The temporal scale is directly proportionate to the accumulation rate of the sediments, which are highly variable through space and time (Hall and Smol, 1999) .

For diatoms, the transition from fresh water to brackish water, the changing in the substrate characteristics and transportation by the tidal currents appears to be some of the most important detenninants that characterise the assemblage (Denys and de Wolf, 1999) . Diatoms can provide an indirect record of climatic change as they are known to respond to the physical and chemical attributes of a water body (Ruhland and Smol, 2005) ; these attributes are a direct manifestation of the balance between inputs, e.g. precipitation and outputs, e.g. evaporation (Fritz et al. 1999) , this can aid in tracing past climatic changes and the results of which can be useful for predicting expected future changes (Snoeijs, 1999) .

                "text": "Since the nineteenth century scientists have identified salinity as the major detenninant of diatom distribution (Denys and de Wolf, 1999) . The main salinity regulating factors within an aquatic system are the inflow of freshwater, the inflow of marine water, precipitation, evaporation and the extent of ice cover (Snoeij s, 1999) . A freshwater body is separated from a saline water body by the salt deposits within its water column, it has been agreed that the boundary between freshwater and saline water is 3 gil (Fritz et at., 1999) . Some species of diatoms are rare or absent above the 3 gil salt concentration mark, while others can only occur above this limit (Fritz ct al. 1999) . The diatom community structure is so sensitive to salinity changes that a one per mil (1 %0) change in salinity can completely change the species composition within the water body (Snoeijs, 1999) . In other words, the \"series of species replacements along the salinity gradient\" (Fritz et a1., 1999, p. 63 ) make diatoms a leading indicator of chemical change within that water body which is driven by changes in hydrology and climate (Fritz ct at., 1999) . Although three factors must be taken into account when using organisms as environmental markers for salinity changes, as outlined by Snoeijs (1999, p. 298 (Anderson, 1995) , therefore changes in salinity can be used to infer changes in climate. Diatoms are distributed into three major groups called a halobian system, which assists in identifying key periods in a lake's development. These groups were outlined by Battarbee (1986) (Fritz et al., 1999) . Significant limitations in salinity reconstructions occur when species diversity is low and the taxa that are present have a large salinity range (Fritz et al., 1999) , or if the assemblage is of a mixed origin Figur\" f __ Rdwionship b\"\"\",,en pH arul W\"'\"I\" Soum' , Imodlfied from hltr;!'-'\",,,\",,\" n ' g>' w iwaler/m'manau lullal/r ph him)",

The nutrient signal in the diatom assemblage can be used to indicate human impacts or environmental changes within the lake basin (Wolin and Duthie, 1999) . It works on the basis that diatoms are sensitive to changes in nutrient concentrations, supply rates and ratios; with each taxon having a specific range and tolerance (Hall and Smol, 1999) . Therefore, the response time to changing nutrient availability and other water quality conditions is particularly rapid (Cooper, 1999) . The combined shift in the relative propOliion of inorganic nutrient concentration and increases in primary production usually indicates eutrophication (Snoeijs, 1999) , although increases in primary production may be at a lag to the changing nutrient status due to the shading effect of the overstorey grass canopy (Sullivan, 1999) . The other possibility when the ratio between nitrogen and phosphorus changes may be a shift from diatoms and other small edible algae to larger cyanobacteria, which may have ramifications on the higher trophic levels (Fritz ct al., 1999) .",

In particular, the upwelling regime of the Benguela system and its associated atmospheric circulation system is strongly linked to coastal aridity along the west coast (Scott and Lee-Thorp, 2004) . It is here that shifts in the easterly and westerly systems would affect climate both presently and historically (Scott and Lee-Thorp, 2004) . Scott and Woodbourne (2007) state that an equatorward or poleward displacement of the westerly belt would alter the winter rainfall zone, whereas an eastward or westward displacement of the tropical easterly winds would alter advection of moisture over the Indian Ocean changing the summer rainfall zone's distribution. In general, precipitation in the winter rainfall zone would increase if the westerlies migrate equatorward and decrease in the summer rainfall zone, as would be expected if the easterlies migrated eastwards (Scott and Woodbourne, 2007) . An example of a strong northward displacement of the westerlies occurred during the Little Ice Age (L1A) some 700 to 400 years ago; the Antarctic Circumpolar Vortex expanded pushing the westerly belt toward the equator, allowing cold air from the Southern Ocean to reach South Africa in the f01111 of deep frontal systems (Duncan, 2006) . This climatic event corresponds to decreases in upwelling events and the renewed introduction of walll1 Agulhas surface water plumes toward the coast by southwesterly winds leading to wetter coastal conditions and generally drier conditions in the interior (Duncan, 2006) .",

                "text": "Since the end of the last glacial period sea level has been on an increase with a 120 m rise towards present day levels, this rise is tenned the Holocene Transgression (Compton, 2001) . Locally, sea level rise allowed for the complete covering of the coastal plain at the beginning of the Holocene (Allanson and Whitfield, 1983) , Ramsay (1995) speculates that the sea continued to rise by 8mm.yr-l between 9000 and 8000 BP with this initial transgression coming within a metre of present levels by 8000 BP (Baxter and Meadows, 1999) , this trend continued throughout the 7000s BP, reaching a peak of 0 -3 m above mean sea level by 6.8 ka (Compton, 2001) . Sea level fluctuations during this time varied on a regional scale along the South African coast due to isostatic adjustment, ice volume changes and local tectonic movements creating a highly variable sea level curve (Compton, 2001 ) ( Figure 7) . A rapid regressive phase about 7000 BP occurred, with sea levels dropping 3 -4 m only to experience a rapid advancement around 6000 BP (Baxter and Meadows, 1995) . This mid-Holocene highstand, which persisted for 2500 years (Ramsay, 1995) , is said to be of a magnitude of 1.5 m to 3 m above mean sea level (a.m.s.!.) (Marker and Miller, 1993) (Compton, 2001) . Estuarine shells from the Sundays River suggest an elevation of 1.5 m a.m.s.l. (Marker and Miller, 1993) ; however other radiocarbon dated sea level indicators from the south coast suggest a magnitude of between 2.4 m and 2.8 m a.m.s.l. (Marker and Miller, 1993) . This is consistent with the 2.5 m terrace on both sides of Swartvlei, an estuary near the town of Sedgefield, which probably fonned as a depositional estuarine terrace (Illenberger, 1996) . According to Ramsay (1995) T o w n higher than present before 5.6 kyr. The higher sea levels are attributed to wanner sea surface temperatures contributing to thermal expansion (Miller et ([/., 1995) . Sea level slowly began to drop and reached 0 m a.m.s.l by 4200 BP (Miller et ([/., 1995) , with a short lived rise around 4000 BP (Baxter and Meadows, 1999) . Throughout the 3000s BP sea level regressed to within a metre of present datum (Compton, 2001) , by around 3000 BP sea level had dropped to below 2 m a.s.l. (Ramsay and Cooper, 2002) with this lowstand maintained until approximately 2000 ka (Compton, 2001) . By 2000 yrs BP sea level has risen again to close to its present level (Birch et a/., 1978) , temporarily rising above present day sea level, indicating a minor recovery from the regression (Baxter and Meadows, 1999) . However, there are suggestions that sea levels began dropping again around l.3 ka and continued to fall until 0.7 ka when it was 0.5 m lower than present (Compton, 2001) . From 0.7 ka the sea has been rising to its present level (Compton, 2001 ); Scott and Lee-Thorp (2004) do suggest that sea levels were lower between 0.5 ka and 0.38 ka as an expression of the early phase of the Little Ice Age.",

Higher SSTs could be interpreted as intensified Westerly circulation bringing forth their associated frontal disturbances and slightly higher Agulhas Current influence (Scott and Lee-Thorp, 2004) . The timing and duration of two episodes of isotopic enrichment in Antarctic ice cores over the last 4000 years, correspond to periods of Holocene Glacier (Cohen et al., 1992) . The first of which occulTcd betwecn 3 and 2000 yrs BP and relates to a worldwide neo-glacial advancc, thc sccond episode occUlTed between 750 and 400 yrs BP and is an expression of the Little Ice Age which reached a maximum 400 yrs ago (Cohen et al., 1992) .

Martin (1960 b ) outlines four developmental stages of the Holocene epoch relating to the Holocene marine transgression prior to this Groenvlei was a freshwater system. The first stage occurred approximately 6900 yrs BP and lasted until 4000 yrs BP, and it typified by the peak of the transgression (Martin, 1960 b ) . The \"marine\" stage was followed by the \"lagoonal\" stage from 4000 yrs BP to 2200 yrs BP based on a decline in marine influence, from 2200 yrs BP Grocnvlei was once again transfonned to a freshwater system, with peat fonnation in the last 900 yrs The climatic conditions associated with these stages are suggested to be, for both the marine and lagoonal stages, either drier and hotter or wetter with increased sand mobility; neither of which are favourable to forest spread, this was followed by more effective moisture allowing for an increase in the forest element with the onset of drier conditions about 900 yrs ago (Martin, 1960 b ) . COl11ish-Bowden (2005) also suggests a series of changing environments which appear to coincide with the stages Martin (1960 b ) proposes, the onset of which may have resulted in the development of a depositional Evidence relating to marine tidal influence throughout the Holocene can be found at Groenvlei, the filled in basin includes marine sediments (Martin, 1962) , occurring on top of peats which suggests that the sea entered Groenvlei periodically (Birch et at., 1978) . Martin (1959) proposed that Groenvlei's link to the sea lay through Swartvlei, an estuary situated directly to the west of Groenvlei (Figure 9 ). The connection takes the fonn of a channel which was first cut during the second marine recession of the current interglacial period (Martin, 1962) . The channel is cut below the level of the 7 m terrace and into the 2.5 m terrace and is currently overlain by a recent dune of unleached, calcareous sand (Martin, 1959) . The sea level highstands in the final stages of the Holocene Transgression increased tidal action and enhanced sediment int1ux",

(1978) states that a 5 m rise in sea level would undercut the seaward dune ridge and engulf Groenvlei and Langvlei, possibly transfonning the dune into an elongate island making both lakes relatively open marine embayments. However, Martin (1956) maintains that there is no implication that the sea was above its present level when it entered Groenvlei. As the sea receded the marine influence on the lake decreased with the lowering of sea levels as well as with the migration of the mouth of Swartvlei eastwards creating a more tenuous link with the sea (Birch et ai., 1978) . It was during these times that an initial increase in sand mobility started filling in the channel, causing a limited amount of water interchange between the two lakes (Illenberger, 1996) .",

Near the margin, the bottom sediments is mainly sandy but with increasing depth bottom sediment is variable consisting of a pale buff-coloured marl with diatom frustules constituting a large portion of surface lake mud a ) ( Figure 13 ).

Lake water is calcareous in nature as a response to the leaching of the slmounding calcareous dunes (Martin, 1960 b ) . Water contains very little organic matter in suspension or in colloidal solution (Martin, 1960<1) , although lake water is rich in solutes, the main ions present are chloride, sodium, bicarbonate, sulphate and magnesium (Martin, 1960 b ) . The relatively high proportion of chloride ions is not derived from the freshwater streams which enter Groenvlei at the foot of the dunes along the northern shore, as these streams are poorer in solutes than the lake It has been hypothesised these theories include the possibility of the concentration of salts by evaporation or possibly salt accumulation derived from sca spray (Mmiin, 1960 h ). These are all viable options and none can be discounted. A highly stable buffering system maintains the pH within the alkaline range of 8 to 9, it is presumed to be a calcium and magnesium carbonate to bicarbonate system (Martin, 1960 h ) . Magnesium replaces calcium as the chief basic ion due to the high precipitation of calcium carbonate by the algal photosynthetic community (Martin, 1960 h ) . Water depth is not so f,Jfeat to allow for complete mixing of the water column; however during wann, still weather temporary thennal stratification occurs . The water is generally well oxygenated, even though Charc/ beds only grow down to a depth of four metres possibly indicating a minor oxygen-deficiency (Mmiin, 1960 a )",

The resulting radiation remains as stmcturally unstable electron traps within the mineral grains, the electrons are then released by shining a beam of light onto the material, the measure of which provides an indication of the time that has elapsed since the last exposure to daylight (Walker, 200S) . Optical dating offers a direct measure of the last time the sediment was exposed to daylight and can provide ages up to ~800 ka (J ain et al., 2004; Lepper, 2007) . In contrast to OSL dating, radiocarbon dates can be obtained on a range of biogenic material (Walker, 200S) . The radiocarbon method is based on the rate of decay of the radioactive or unstable carbon isotope 14 ( 14 C) in organic material (Walker, 200S) . The rate of radioactive decay of the unstable isotope is constant; therefore by measuring the amount of 14C remaining in a sample of fossil material and comparing to modem 14C material an age can be detennined (Walker, 200S) . The half-life of the radioactive isotope is ~S730 years, gIV1I1g an upper dateable age limit of approximately 4S 000 years (Walker, 200S) . Olive/Gray",

This generated approximately 30 to 35 samples from the GK2 core, giving a detailed temporal scale of environmental change at periods through the Holocene. The extraneous materials required removal so as to concentrate the diatom sample; this included salts, organic matter and minerogenic matter. The main objective in chemically treating the samples extracted from the individual cores was to obtain satisfactory microscope slides for analysis. For this to succeed celiain steps were undertaken for the effective extraction of the fossils, these steps are outlined below (as adapted from Battarbee, 1986) and displayed in Figure   16 :",

Fragments were also included in the count; but to avoid double counting, only fragments that include the valve centre or a single characteristic feature of the valve were included.

Weighted Averaging (WA) reconstructions take averages twice, once in the regression and once in the calibration, this can result in a deshrinking is required as a correction (Birks ct al., 1990) . This is achieved through the use of a linear ret,'Tession model which regresses the initial infelTed values of the training set on the observed values; this is tenned a classical regression (Birks ct al., 1990 ). The classical regression has a tendency to take infelTed values further away from the mean, whereas an inverse ret,'Tession minimizes the root mean squared elTor (RMSE) in the training set (Birks et ai., 1990) . The RMSE gives a measure of the 'apparent' enor (Roberts and McMinn, 1998) ; hence the value of the RMSE evaluates how well a model can be expected to function as a predictive tool (Birks et al., 1990) .",

The radiocarbon dates were detennined by the Quaternary Dating Research Unit (QUADRU) at the CSIR in Pretoria and were calibrated using the program CaLib Version 5.0 (Stuiver and Reimer, 1993) with the calibration dataset SHCa104 for Southern Hemisphere terrestrial samples (McConnac ct al., 2004) . Probabilities are ranked to a 95.4% confidence intervaL i.e. 2cr (sigma) with the relative area under the probability curve calculated and nonnalized to one (Stuiver ct al., 2005) . The number of calibrated ranges is related to the relative area covered by the probability curve and in cases where more than one range is reported Stuiver ct al. (2005) suggests that the extremes of the ranges can be given. Hence, in Table 2 below, the extremes of the lower and upper calibrated range is reported when more than one range is produced as well as the median probability over all ranges. Several sand samples from the Groenvlei cores, GKI and GK2 were extracted for luminescence dating, which was carried out at the Centre for the Environment, Oxford University (Table 3 ). Prior to detennining the ages several corrections need to be made, one of which is for dose rate. The environmental dose rate is a measure of the radiation per unit of time since the zeroing of the luminescence clock, which is \"calculated from an analysis of the radioactive elements within the sample and its sunounclings\" (Walker, 2005, p. 98 ",

The introduction of Pillus into the region is known from historical records having occurred during the early stages of the 20 th century and provides an excellent chronological marker (Duncan, 2006) . Lower down the cores, two probably short-lived episodes of very rapid sediment deposition occur at depths equating to approximately 4 ka and 8 ka (Figure 17) . The most recent episode spans from ~ 830 mm to ~ 330 mm in the GK 2 core and consists of light grey, coarse sand; the horizon of which merges with the root mat dated at around 600 BP. Sediments of the period connecting the sand bar with the formation of peat underwent post depositional erosion, therefore sediments and fossils are thus indistinguishable in age. It can be said that the transition from the ~ 4 ka episode and the root mat having experienced removal of sediment over the 3500 year gap left behind 130 mm of trace material in the GK2 core between the two sedimentary zones (Figure 17) . The time between the two rapid deposition events from ~ 4 ka and ~ 8 ka also appears to have been associated with either a depositional hiatus or a continual removal of sediment possibly by wave action over the 4000 year gap, leaving behind approximately 200 mm of trace material in the GK2 core ( Figure 17) . Mid-Holocene high sea levels may have contributed to the removal of sediment from the GK 2 area as the core site is near the proposed channel connecting Groenvlei to the sea via Swartvlei. Sea levels retumed to present levels around 4200 BP (Miller et al., 1995) , just prior to the ~ 4 ka event; possibly allowing for 200 years of sequential deposition of sediment before its onset. A new depositional stage occurring between 925 and 830 mm is evident in the stratibTfaphy and may substantiate the 200 year deposition event as pinkish, grey sand with clear laminations are observed; this would suggest that the rate of deposition near the GK 2 site during this stage would be close to 0.5 mm.y(l.",

The fossil assemblage is characterised by two diatom fossil depositional periods and are further subdivided into five zones between the time intervals of 4.2 ka to 4 ka and 0.7 ka to the present. A hiatus occurs between the two periods and has been designated as Zone c. The separation between the two time intervals lasts 3.5 thousand years which corresponds to active sand movement in the area during this time. Diatom frustules are not well preserved in a coarse sand matrix, this fact may be the reason behind highly fragmented diatom frustules in the samples from the hiatus period. The only fragments which are discemible come from the diatom CampylodiscllS c~vpells, a planktonic species which favours inland waters with high conductivity as well as inland saline waters and weakly brackish waters (Wasylikowa, 2006) (Figure 21 b) . A description of each zone and their prevailing environmental nature with notable diatom species occurrence is given below with a more detailed table of the dominant and subdominant species per time step displayed in Table 4 .",

Zone (a) occUlTing from depths 925 to 800 mm spans about two hundred years; whereas Zone (b), from depth 800 to 600 mm, corresponds to at best a few decades and appears to occur concurrently with major aeolian activity. Dominant and subdominant species for both Zones are summarised in (Table 8 ). Cocconcis cngclbraclztii is endemic to South Africa, preferring brackish waters with highly elevated electrolyte content (Taylor ct al., 2007) . Just prior to the 4 ka event, most of these species have steadily dropped in abundance, with other species like Achnantizidiwll minutissil71a occurring. Aciznanthidilll1l minlltissima is abundant in fresh to brackish waters which are circumneutral or alkaline in nature with low or moderate concentrations of nutrients and organic material (Kelly ct al., 2005; Telford, 2001) (Table 8 ). Planktonic and aerophilous taxa are minimal, suggesting moderate water levels which is optimum for a benthic diatom community. Zone b represents a very ShOli time interval with dynamic changes in the assemblage due to the rapid changes occurring in the environment at around 4 ka. Rlzoicosphcnia abbrc)'iata peaks at 800 mm (~ 4000 yrs ago), comprising nearl y 80% of the diatom assemblage (Figure 22 ). Rhoicosphcnia abbrcl'iata ( Figure 210 ) is commonly found attached to filamentous algae or to rocks (Kelly ct al., 2005) and is indicative of slightly brackish conditions (Hedenstrom and Risberg, 1999) (Table 8) .",

Mastogloia clliptica makes its only appearance in the assemblage during this stage; a species which extends into brackish water bodies, requires non-acidic conditions and can be sensitive to pollution (Kelly ct al., 2005) (Table 8 ). E'pithcmia adnata also makes its first appearance and reaches a peak around 450 years ago; it lives attached to macrophytes and other solid substrata; generally found in neutral to high pH environments and is tolerant of elevated water temperatures (Taylor ct al., 2007) (Kelly ct al., 2005) , Epithcmia adnata is apparently capable of Nitrogen fixation via endosymbiotic blue-green algae, which may be beneficial for the later colonisation by vascular plants (Kelly ct al., 2005) . One eutrophic diatom able to survive critical levels of pollution makes an appearance during this period (Kelly ct al., 2005) ; C.vclotclla mcncglziniana has a cosmopolitan distribution in the benthos and plankton of electrolyte rich rivers, streams and lakes (Taylor ct aI, 2007) . Aerophilic species such as Rhopalodia gibbcrllla (Figure 21 h) and Syncdra tablliata also start making an appearance after the (Table 6 ) and are accompanied by S.vnedra aCltS, Syncdra tablllata and Syncdra ulna ( Figure 22) ; all three S.vncdra species are epiphytes, prefening fresh brackish, alkaliphilous waters (Kelly ct al., 2005) (Table 8 ).",

The division from the marine stages to the lagoonal stages represents successively lower salinity levels, although salinity varied considerably during this time the separation between the two stages is co-incident with the ultimate extinction of marine diatom species (Martin, 1959) The upper unit encompasses the last 700 years and includes recent climatic events which have been indicated in other palaeoclimatic studies such as those conducted in the Cango Caves (Talma and Vogel, 1992) and Makapansgat Valley (Holmgren ct at., 1999) . Both speleothem records point to 16 th and 1 i h century (0.45 ka and 0. (Holmgren ct al., 1999) and the expansion of colonial influence since the mid 18 th century (~150 cal yrs BP) (Duncan, 2006) . The depositional unit spans for approximately 200 years and indicates radical changes in the physiochemical parameters of Groenvlei around the time. The period commences after the partial stabilisation of the coastal dunes in the region (Butzer and Helgren, 1972) and tenninates at about 4000 yrs BP when dunes once again became unstable (Mmiin, 1968) . The lake substratum appears to be consistent with fine sediments providing a suitable environment for diatoms to prosper. The diatom assemblage suggests that conditions were initially alkalibiontic and brackish to brackish fresh with high mineral content. Over the next 200 years salinity becomes highly variable but with an overall trend toward a fresh brackish habitat; pH follows suit as water alkalinity advances toward neutrality. Water levels appear to be higher than presently observed, as witnessed through the abundance of diatom fossils some distance from the present day shoreline and remains relatively stable during this period; that is until the transition from the marine stage to the lagoonal stage; where an increase in planktonic species occurs directly followed by the appearance of aerophilic taxa. The planktonic component coupled with the declining pH toward neutral may allude to increases in rainfall resulting in a rise in water levels within Groenvlei (see Chapter 2.3.3); allegedly the climatic mechanism behind the wetter climate during this period is the greater influence of Atlantic cyclones to the southwestem Cape (Hassan, 1997) . Whereas the sudden increase in the aerophilic component at the expense of planktonic taxa directly afterwards indicates a shift toward a drier climate. Scott and Lee-Thorp (2004) suggested that around 4000 BP a short-lived dry spell occurred, which could possibly be the reason behind the growth of aerophilous taxa as water levels would drop due to decreases in rainfall. Evidence T o w n may be interpreted as the response of the lake to the marine intrusions which frequently entered Groenvlei creating a slow f10wing tide as shown by the subdominance of RllOpafodia gibba in the earlier stages (Kelly ct af., 2005) . Isotopic analysis on molluscan shells from the Groenvlei core, GK2, showed a cOlTclation between the 12C/13C and 18 0 /16 0 signal which was attributed to the mixing of two f1uids with different isotopic composition (Kirsten, 2005) ; this cOlTclation may contlnn the sea water intrusions as well as the full mixing of the other source waters in the lake creating the brackish to brackish fresh environment. The later stage, as depicted by Zone b, occulTed COnClllTently with the 4 ka event and shows the struggle between two natural forcing factors, viz the rapid rise in sea level at around 4000 yrs BP (Baxter and Meadows, 1999) and the remobilisation of the sand dunes (Martin, 1968 ). The interplay between these processes seems to have affected the salinity and pH of the lake and brought on its isolation from Swat1vlei to the west, effectively filling in the channel and creating a lagoonal environment which was in full effect at the end of the period as shown by the dominance of Anol71ocol1cis sphaerophora (Hedenstrom and Risberg, 1999) . The increase in epilithic taxa ncar the end of the period is also indicative of an enhancement in sediment movement and dune instability.",

                "text": "Indeed, sediments of this age are not sampled in the Groenvlei cores. Duncan (2006) encountered the same problem during her pollen analysis, stating that the sand section imposed a \"significant hiatus in the record\" and declined to make any environmental inference. Therefore, it would be unwise to make assumptions about the environmental conditions on the basis of the diatom remains that do occur in this facies. It may be that the OCCUlTence of Camprfodisclis C~)'pCllS frustules in the sedimentary sequence during this period indicates increased salinity, a pH greater than seven and increased water levels due to the planktonic nature of the species. In fact, the material making up the sand bar, which extends from 830 mm to 330 mm is consistent with aeolian sedimentation as noted in Kirsten (2005) and Cornish-Bowden (2005) . It is, therefore, likely that diatom remains were transported by wind into the Groenvlei catchment during the active dune destabilisation period and cannot be used to infer environmental conditions during this time. The Little Ice Age is a global climatic phenomenon which lasted five centuries tel111inating by about 1810 AD (140 yrs BP), although it has rarely been observed in the southel11 African palaeorecord (Holmgren et at., 1999) . While it is generally accepted that the Little Ice Age is evident in some records across South Africa its influence on different regions has been variable (e.g. Talma and Vogel, 1990; Holmgren et at., 1999; Tyson et at., 2000) . The Makapansgat Valley stalagmite record suggests that this period was associated with lower than average temperatures and drier conditions related to the regional expansion of the circumpolar westerlies (Holmgren et at., 1999) . During the dry spells an increase in frequency of deep, intense thunderstonns and hail is experienced over the interior as oppose to the \" ... persistent wann rainfall from middle-level stratifol111 cloud bands associated with tropical-temperate troughs\" which occurs during wetter periods (Holmbrren et at., 1999, p. 303) . However, through pollen analysis of the GK1 core Duncan (2006) proposed that this period was rather moist due possibly to increased frontal systems trailing across South Africa owing to the expansion of the circumpolar vortex resulting in reduced upwelling and the introduction of wann Agulhas cutTent surface water plumes towards the coast. Duncan's (2006) is principally dominated by four species which frequent alkaliphilous, moderate to high electrolyte content and fresh brackish habitats . Cyelotella mClleglzillialla may be suggestive of high levels of organic loading and even eutrophication (Kelly et al., 2005) . It is impOliant at this point to specify that Groenvlci today is without outlet and is mainly fcd by groundwater and surface runoff the chemistry of which is related to changes in the watershed. The wetter conditions during thc Late Holocene would have increased surface runoff causing widespread erosion leading to changes in the water chemistry (Lewis, 2008) ; hencc altcring biological community. A sudden and dramatic increase of Epitlzemia adnata about 450 years ago is consistent with a wanning phase during the mid 1500s AD; this was also evident in the Holmgren et al. (1999) 8 1i1 0 analysis of the Makapansgat Valley stalagmite which indicates a slight wanning between 1500 and 1675 (450 yrs BP and 275 yrs BP). The wanning phase was coupled by a minor reinforcement in alkalinity and salinity as well as the renewed introduction of aerophilic taxa implying a drop in water levels; this could be interpreted as a decrease in rainfall as the circumpolar vOliex weakened. The aerophilic component rcmains until the mid 1600s then diminishes in presence as the species are replaced with benthic taxa relating to a recovery of water levels equivalent to that experienced prior to the warming phase.",

The increase in taxa which favour periodically dry habitats is directly related to the dropping water levels and the receding shoreline of Groenvlei coupled with the advance of the reed swamp presently observed around the periphery of the lake. A decidedly electrolyte-rich environment is established, as changes in the watershed alter the chemical make up of runoff water into the lake. Runoff is one of the main inlet water sources into The fundamental objective of this study was to supply an accurate account of the changes in natural processes over time by using the fossil diatom assemblage preserved in the lake sediments of Groenvlei as a medium. For this to be achieved an acceptable chronology was constmcted using two dating methods on which the variations in the fossil assemblage could be conelated. By undertaking both quantitative and qualitative approaches several environmental parameters where detennined, aiding in developing a detailed environmental reconstruction for the south coast region. Salinity, pH, water levels and conductivity were detennined through an ecologically based indicator study using species classification schemes as a means to ascertain variations on the environment. Conductivity and pH were further analysed quantitatively, offering a specified numerical range to the changes in the physiochemical parameters and were verified by the classification schemes previously undeliaken. The outcome of the combined techniques has supplied a reasonably high temporal resolution study against which infonnation on patterns of climatic variability could be assessed.",

When attempting to reconstruct past environments certain fundamental principles are applied, the most well known being the unifonnitarian approach, which implies that fossil organisms have the same biological and environmental requirements as their modem day counterparts (Lawrence, 1971). Thus, by transfen'ing an organism's modem ecological situation to its fossilised occurrences within the palaeorecord, one can create a snapshot of the environment at the time of deposition and with it resolve external environmental factors relating to climate and distribution. The paleorecord may manifest itself in various fonns, although as demonstrated in this thesis, lake sediments have shown patiicular promise in this regard. Changes within a lake related to environmental drivers are usually rapid and nonnally have knock on effects on the biological community; in this way, the examination of fossil assemblages can provide key insights into changes in the environment and their related causes.",

However, the occunence of the episammic species, Stallrosira clliptica and Stallrosirclla pinnata, which remaincd relatively stable during the previous stage; begin to dramatically decrease in the later phase of the sequence toward the present day indicating a reduction of coarse sediment supply into the lake. Cornish-Bowden's (2005) sediment analysis showed a considerable decrease in the sand constituent of the textural composition of the Groenvlei core but increases in mud and organic matter. The changes in the diatom assemblage relating to sediment supply shifts pertain to the timing of human interference in the natural dune activity of the region through the introduction of alien vegetation and dune stabilisation programs since the mid 1800s(Hellstrom, 1996) (see Chapter 4.3.2).",

Duncan(2006) goes as far as stating that of allotments within the Grocnvlei catchment for agricultural purposes probably disturbed the rather sensitive nutrient cycle, causing ramifications in plant succession, thus altering runoff and groundwater quality ultimately affecting the biological community of Groenvlei.It is clear, however, that not all changes observed in the assemblage are solely attributable to human interference as changes in the climate over the last 250 years could be an additional underlying mechanism as witnessed throughout the remainder of the sequence. However, the complexity involved in trying to disentangle the climate signal from human influence on the environment is beyond the scope of this study and further research is required to achieve an indication of the course of both natural and artificial processes present in the region. It could be presumed that climatic conditions post LIA set the course in Groenvlei's modification as detailed previously and human influence amplified the signal.",

Ramifications of which were felt throughout both the abiotic and biotic constituents of the ecosystem as altering salinity, pH, nutrient availability and water levels resulted in the modification of the biological community in rcsponsc. This two hundred year episode saw the metamorphosis of a lake from a marine embayment to a coastal lake caused by the remobilisation of local dunes and minimiscd marine influence due to the filling in of the channel. The second unit spanned the last seven hundred years and extended the full length of the Little Ice Age, as well as the beginnings of human interference in the region since the mid 1700s AD. The natural climate phenomenon identified as the Little Ice Age caused widespread cooling and wetter conditions along the coast resulting in increased water levels and fresh water conditions; it is however, punctuated by a wanning period approximately 400 years ago causing a decrease in rainfall and hence in water levels and increased water temperatures. The onset of human occupation within the region exacerbated conditions leading to increases in nutrient availability and dropping water levels, these changes in the catchment relating to forestry and agriculture can not be solely attributed to Groenvlei's environmental state as further investigations are required to ascertain climatic forcings during this period.",
