Certain trail sites are specified as a National Natural Landmark by the National Park Service. The Colorado Geological Survey lists the trail as a Point of Geological Interest, and the state designated a larger area along the ridge, including the trail, as a Colorado Natural Area. Here, in the Jurassic Morrison Formation, in addition to fossil dinosaur bones, there are tracks at the \"Theropod Track Site\" and the \"Brontosaur Bulges Site (BBS).\" Besides sauropod bulges at the BBS, a single trackway of smaller bulges pointed out by Lockley and Marshall (2018) appears to exemplify walking transitioning to wading behavior. An unique, positive pes-manus couplet similar to Stegopodus and probably from a stegosaur was collected from a boulder at the Dinosaur Bone Quarry Site (DBQS) by the nearby Morrison Natural History Museum (MNHM) and is displayed there (Mossbrucker et al., 2008) . MNHM also displays dime-sized baby stegosaur pes prints that they discovered near the DBQS (Mossbrucker et al., 2009) .",

Nearly all indicate walking behavior, with some trackways being parallel, suggesting gregarious behavior, a characteristic of ornithopods. Running behavior based on extended stride length for at least one juvenile ornithopod has been reported (Lockley et al., 2000) at a reinforced site at road level between the \"Slimy Beach\" and \"Plant Impressions\" sites. Many of the tracks are preserved in sandstone in the Lower South Platte Formation (Fig. 1B) as undertracks formed well below tracks made in overlying soft mud in shale or mudstone that has since crumbled away or been excavated. Unfortunately, the original discovery of 13 very unusual tracks uncovered during construction of the West Alameda Parkway by the WPA in 1937, disappeared, perhaps as early as the 1950s. Unprotected at the side of the road, they presumably succumbed to weathering by mass wasting, and possibly erosion caused by climbing by people and wildlife, vandalism or theft.",

Earlier studies of purported swim tracks of sauropods and ornithopods have been questioned in reports mentioned by Milner et al. (2006) . Compared to dinosaur walking footprints, swim tracks are acknowledged to be less common, less complete and more difficult to interpret (Milner et al., 2006; Xing et al., 2013) . The original discovery of the lost tracks may have been of the first known dinosaur swim marks, but they were not systematically described and published. Ironically, after hundreds of additional tracks were eventually documented on Dinosaur Ridge by Lockley and Hunt (1995) , the lost tracks remain arguably the most unique and most significant, until the recent discovery of two raptor footprints (Lockley et al., 2016b) .

Historical mileages can be a problem if either the road was subsequently modified significantly or the starting point (0.0 km) is uncertain. In this case, the starting point is described as the \"hairpin curve,\" which could mean the point at the apex of the curve of W. Alameda Parkway at the top of Dinosaur Ridge resembling the closed end of a hairpin. Or, \"hairpin\" may have differentiated the curve from the closer, broader one in the opposite direction to the north (Fig. 1A) . In the second case, the starting point was probably the closest point of the hairpin curve to the tracks, i.e., where the road changed from more or less a straightaway on the east side of the ridge and began to curve sharply toward the apex (Fig. 1A) . The distance along the curve between the apex and the beginning of the curve is roughly 40 m. The odometer distance, 0.72 km, likely was interpolated between calibration points of 0.16 km on an odometer dial, adding uncertainty. A point 0.72 km north along the straightaway from the beginning of the curve more closely matches a location consistent with a historic photograph of the track site. These directions were adequate, given that the original intent was probably to get one close enough to the tracks to see them; presumably, it was not anticipated that the tracks would disappear.",

By 1998, the same road cut was reduced to largely a talus slope of tile-like slabs of the Mowry Shale as it weathered from the sloping outcrop.

One of us (TC) observed this pattern marked by an arrow in a close-up photograph of the missing trackway (Fig. 4) . The fractured Mowry Shale sits beneath the track-bearing layer (Fig. 4) , which is darker, possibly iron stained, and is described by Markman (1938) as sandstone. Shale immediately above the track layer would have made for an excellent parting that revealed the track layer. This indication that the tracks were in the marine Mowry Shale supports evidence of a swimming posture to be discussed.

In addition to showing details of the outcrop, Figure 4 has all 13 tracks (#'s 1-13) and small partial sole prints not previously described. A track outline map from Markman (1938, p. 43 ), Figure 5 , shows the trackway (tracks #2- 4, 6-13). It is in good agreement with measurements mentioned by Markman for average length of a \"stride\" (actually a half stride), width of one of the best tracks, and an average length of the middle toe impressions. Definitions of trackway and track measurements from Lockley and Hunt (1995, p . 9-10) used here include midline, width of trackway, length of stride, width of track, length of track, and degree of rotation (of a footprint) toward or away from the midline. It appears that Markman used \"stride\" for the measurement of a pace or step parallel to the midline. Since, in this case, the steps are roughly equal and because he gave an average (0.97 m) his stride can be considered a half stride.",

Single intermittent tracks on track-covered surfaces were interpreted to be from swimming ornithopods occasionally putting down a foot and pushing off. This reasonable explanation suggests that ornithopods could swim freely above the substrate. Other trackways of pes prints, Amblydactylus similar to Caririchnium, show wading into deeper water where at some point the onset of fainter sole prints indicates significant buoyancy, marking a transition from wading to swimming.

Class 2 swimming can be differentiated from a running posture up on the toes, which would have lengthened strides, with a high calculated speed instead of shortening strides by swimming. Lockley (1985) dismissed a running posture for the lost tracks based on stride length. Class 3 swimming has noticeable evidence of buoyancy, differentiating it from wading.

Wading, conceptualized here as basically walking in shallow water from ankle deep to knee deep or more, could be difficult to differentiate from walking. Considerations such as a wider gait, shorter stride length, the paleoenvironment and, especially, sequentially deepening footprints, can suggest wading. Deepening footprints are well exemplified in a sauropod trackway in the Upper Jurassic Morrison of southeastern Colorado (Lockley, 1986) and at a previously mentioned trackway of a biped at the Brontosaurus Bulges Site on Dinosaur Ridge with deepening from ~ 2 cm to ~ 30 cm. However without such evidence, walking has probably been the default conclusion in a number of studies. Diving, a swimming behavior practiced by some extant animals, is probably not discernible from track data. However, Spinosaurus of North Africa, the largest theropod, is interpreted to have been a swimmer, even semi-aquatic, based on anatomy (Ibrahim et al., 2014) and oxygen isotopes (Amiot et al., 2010) and a piscivore based on conical teeth and gut contents with fish scales in the type specimen of a similar theropod, Baryonyx (Charig et al., 2010) .",

Such trackways may represent subconscious or unintentional behavior, but they probably were mostly a response to environmental factors such as obstacles, wetter ground, standing water or even sounds or smells, factors ostensibly unknowable to researchers. However, general causation can possibly be inferred from comparing large, similar tracksites. For example, the main tracksite at Dinosaur Ridge has 37 trackways from 22 ornithopods and 15 theropods. All appear to be straight lines on a map (Lockley, 2001, p. 8-9) annotated with 13 straight directional arrows. The pattern suggests a large, open, obstaclefree area such as a mud flat or marsh. Inferred herding behavior with ornithopods walking shoulder to shoulder would also have contributed to straight line travel. By contrast, the Clayton Lake tracksite of similar size and age and part of the same megatracksite, has two gently curved trackways (Lucas and Dalman, 2016, figs. 12a,c) among five that are illustrated. The authors describe morphological and extramorphological details of certain ornithopod pes prints that indicate there was a very soft to \"soupy\" substrate in places. Avoidance of areas of very soft substrate indicated by standing water, vegetation patterns or other signals may have been a factor that led to curved trackways at Clayton Lake. Future photogrammetric mapping may provide greater insight. Sharper curves or turns, such as the one in the lost trackway, may have had completely different causes.",

Lockley (1985) agreed with the initial interpretation of carnosaur without benefit of examining the tracks and without having studied the large inventory of hundreds of other tracks on Dinosaur Ridge. The tracks were later re-interpreted as from an ornithopod (Lockley and Hunt, 1995, p. 198) without discussion.

An estimated foot size is 48 cm wide (measured) and 55 cm long, which is estimated based on the fact that most theropod feet are longer than wide. This far exceeds foot lengths of Magnoavipes (20-25 cm) and Dromaeosauripus (16 cm) found in the South Platte Formation on Dinosaur Ridge, leaving one to wonder if there was a large theropod that preyed on the large Caririchnium-making ornithopods. Because tracks of large theropods are generally uncommon, particularly those of tyrannosaurids, which are extremely rare, the proof of absence of large theropods in the Dakota is weak. There are also no bones of large theropods in the South Platte Formation, but then bones and teeth of dinosaurs and bones, teeth and shells of other animals were not preserved, likely because of an acidic depositional environment. That these swimming tracks of the Mowry differ from theropod swim tracks in Spain and China is a consideration, but large theropods may have had a different swimming posture, particularly when making a long swim.

A running posture up on the toes is not viable because of the short length of the pace that indicates a slow-walking speed. A slow-walking posture may have resulted in under tracks with deep toe prints preserved and shallower sole prints removed with the overlying layer/s.

Differences with the comparison trackway include the absence of most of the sole pad imprints and the very wide gait.",

A tenth site at Lost Tracks with an exhibit including a photo and map (Figs. 4-5) would provide context for rare swimming tracks to complement running, walking and wading tracks at other trail sites. This case history would be a reminder for preserving rare fossils in public places, and would add to the educational resources of a premier public outdoor geological and paleontological laboratory.",
