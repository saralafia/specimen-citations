Some complete and fragmentary coprolites are over 12 cm in length. Olson and Mead (1982, p. 26) concluded that \"the largest, those 10 cm or more in length, almost certainly pertain to Dimetrodon, the only known member of the fauna large enough to have produced them.\" The purpose of this paper is to evaluate this hypothesis and to describe a new morphology of large coprolite from the Lower Permian of Texas.

This area included three principal vertebrate bone localities as well as two specimens of tetrapod tracks (Olson and Mead, 1982; Lucas and Hunt, 2005) . Some of the coprolites from this area came from Olson and Mead's (1982) site 1, bed 3. However, varied preservation suggests that some coprolites came from at least two different localities. Olson and Mead (1982) reported that other coprolites came from the valley floor, which had been disturbed by plowing, and these may have all been catalogued into the University of California at Los Angeles collection.",

Diagnosis: Coprolite that differs from other ichnogenera in having a surface texture with a fibrous, ropy texture and in being over 10 cm in length.Discussion: This ichnogenus is currently only known from the middle Leonardian Vale Formation. We term the distinctive surface texture \"strophic\" from the Greek for twisted cord or rope. It is unclear what vertebrate yielded this ichnogenus. (Fig. 1L) .Diagnosis: As for genus. Description: TMM 30966 (Fig. 1K, M) is 144 mm long, 53 mm in maximum width and 25 mm in width. The coprolite is composed of two terminal portions that have tapering, rounded apices. These portions exhibit a distinctive linear surface texture reminiscent of rope (Fig. 1M ). In the middle portion of the coprolite the texture is more irregular Discussion: The referred specimen preserves the same strophic surface texture as the holotype, but it is different in overall morphology (Fig. 1L ). This coprolite is broken, and it is similar to the holotype in that several segments can be distinguished. The first segment has a linear strophic texture. The remainder of the coprolite consists of three tapering segments that are curled. This curling is distinct from the spiraling found in coprolites such as Heteropolacopros texaniensis and is found in the posterior portion of many coprolites.",

Several of these coprolites are spiraled and represent large specimens of Heteropolacopros texaniensis. Other specimens are also spiraled. All spiraled coprolites represent fish, possibly xenacanth sharks. Two of the Vale specimens represent Strophocopros valensis ichnogen. et ichnosp. nov., which is characterized by a strophic (ropy) surface texture. Most of the coprolites from Permo-Triassic redbeds may have been produced by fish. Taylor County.
