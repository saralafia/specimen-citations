                "text": "Spinosuchus caseanus is an unusual Late Triassic fossil reptile that has received relatively little attention since its original description by CASE (1922) . This is likely due, at least in part, to its problematic taxonomic position; it has been interpreted as a theropod dinosaur (CASE 1922 (CASE , 1927 (CASE , 1932 , a basal saurischian (VON HUENE 1932; HUNT et al. 1998) , an indeterminate neodiapsid (LONG & MURRY 1995) , a \"trilophosaurian\" archosauromorph (RICHARDS 1999) or an indeterminate archosauromorph (NESBITT et al. 2007) . Here, we review previous studies of Spinosuchus caseanus, redescribe the holotype specimen, describe newly recognized specimens, evaluate its taxonomic position and discuss its stratigraphic distribution. We conclude that Spinosuchus caseanus is closely related to Trilophosaurus, as originally posited by RICHARDS (1999) , and belongs within the family Trilophosauridae. In addition, we present a revised diagnosis of the family Trilophosauridae, which, in addition to S. caseanus, includes two species of Trilophosaurus, T. buettneri and T. jacobsi (SPIEL-MANN et al. 2007a , 2008 . A c k n o w l e d g m e n t s STERLING NESBITT and an anonymous reviewer provided comments that improved the manuscript. ROBERT KAHLE donated the Spinosuchus caseanus specimens from the KAHLE Trilophosaurus quarry. KARL KRAINER provided a translation of VON HUENE (1932) . The New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science supported the collecting and preparation efforts for this research. GREGG GUNNELL (UMMP) provided collection access to the holotype of S. caseanus, logistical support for JAS and ABH and facilitated the loan to HRR during research for his MS thesis, portions of which are published herein. R. J. ZAKRZEWSKI helped HRR secure the loan of the specimen and provided a secure place of study for the specimen while at Fort Hays State University. TAKEHITO IKEJIRI kindly returned the specimen to UMMP.",

Curiously, the illustration does not include the elongate neural spines that would later be used to distinguish the taxon; the text also does not make special note of the neural spines. CASE (1922) assigned the material to the dinosaur genus Coelophysis, based principally on similarities between the first four preserved vertebrae and those of the syntypes of COPE's Coelophysis (see SPIELMANN et al. 2007b , and references cited therein for a recent discussion of COPE's Coelophysis syntypes in relation to the modern concept of Coelophysis). CASE (1922: 82) also concluded that the vertebrae pertained to a dinosaur based on \"fractures in the midline of several vertebrae show[ing] that the centrum [is] hollow.\" CASE (1927) provided a more complete description of the vertebral series of UMMP 7507, including a reconstruction. In this publication, he highlighted the expanded neural spines of the specimen and assigned it to Coelophysis aff. C. longicollis. CASE (1927) also assigned numerous elements from the same locality and horizon as the vertebral series to Coelophysis; including the posterior portion of a skull (UMMP 8870), an ilium (UMMP 8870), a large femur (UMMP 3396), four lots of caudal vertebrae (including UMMP 7277) and 22 teeth. Although CASE (1927) did not explicitly state that this material belonged to the same individual as the vertebral series, the implication was seized upon by others, most notably VON HUENE (1932) , who assessed these \"referred\" specimens.",

                "text": "VON HUENE (1932) reidentified CASE's Coelophysis aff. C. longicollis as a distinct genus and species, which he named Spinosuchus caseanus, the specific name honoring CASE. VON HUENE (1932) also reidentified some of CASE's (1927) referred specimens as parasuchian (UMMP 8870) or aetosaurian (UMMP 7277). In addition, VON HUENE (1932) described an isolated braincase and referred it to Spinosuchus. He distinguished the taxon mostly on the basis of the elongate neural spines of the vertebrae. LONG & MURRY (1995: 198) , in their review of Late Triassic tetrapods from the American Southwest, placed Spinosuchus caseanus in Neodiapsida incertae sedis, but noted that when known from more complete material it \"will be found to represent [a distinct] lineage among the Archosauromorpha.\" HUNT et al. (1998) summarized the taxonomic controversies surrounding Spinosuchus. In addition, they focused on the hollow centra as a potentially dinosaurian character, as well as the possible presence of hyposphenehypantrum articulations, which were not visible to HUNT at the time of his visit to UMMP. Summarily, they noted that further preparation may be the only way to conclusively demonstrate the taxonomic affinities of Spinosuchus caseanus. RICHARDS (1999) reexamined the osteology and taxonomy of Spinosuchus caseanus in an unpublished masters thesis. He rejected previous taxonomic interpretation of S. caseanus as a theropod dinosaur and instead argued for a close relationship between it and the archosauromorph Trilophosaurus, placing it within the Trilophosauria of ROMER (1956) . We agree with RICHARDS' (1999) interpretation that Spinosuchus and Trilophosaurus are closely related, and unite them within the family Trilophosauridae as discussed below. HECKERT et al. (2001) described vertebrae that they tentatively assigned to Spinosuchus from the KAHLE Trilophosaurus quarry (NMMNH locality 3775) from stratigraphically low in the Trujillo Formation of West Texas. After further collecting and preparation of material from the KAHLE site we confirm the presence of S. caseanus at this locality and describe and illustrate this material below. NESBITT et al. (2007: 225) , in their review of North American Late Triassic dinosaurs, noted that the cervicals of the holotype of S. caseanus \"lack any clear excavations or pleurocoels, which are found in Coelophysis bauri, Coelophysis rhodesiensis, 'Syntarsus' kayentakatae and nearly all other theropods (RAUHUT 2003) .\" They concluded that no characteristics \"distinguish Spinosuchus from other archosauriforms other than the autapomorphic neural spines\" (NESBITT et al. 2007: 225) . In addition, they critiqued the interpretation of RICHARDS (1999) , noting that the characteristics he used to unite Spinosuchus with Trilophosaurus are \"archosauromorph symplesiomorphies or are not restricted to only in [sic] Spinosuchus and Trilophosaurus\" (NESBITT et al. 2007: 225 ).",

The holotype was originally embedded in plaster, in right lateral view, sometime prior to the publication of CASE (1927) , which was the first work to photographically illustrate the specimen. As of December 2006, our last examination of the specimen, it still resided in this same plaster mount, though several centra have been loosened to the point where they can be removed for study. In only a few cases can a neural spine be viewed from all sides, although some details are visible in oblique anterior and posterior views. Because of this, not all of the vertebrae of the holotype could be examined or photographically illustrated in all views . Vertebrae that could not be removed from the plaster, so that only their right lateral sides could be viewed, are noted throughout our description and figure captions. However, comparing the original photographs of CASE (1927, pl. 1) with our recent photographs ( Fig. 1 ) reveals that nearly all the elements of the holotype are still present and relatively in place, though given its fragile nature further degradation to the specimen could easily occur.",

This nomenclature was originally developed for use with saurischian dinosaurs, especially sauropods, but no equivalent nomenclature has been developed for more basal archosauromorphs, and we prefer to use established nomenclature than to invent our own. The use of this nomenclature is not an indication of homology between various vertebral laminae in Spinosuchus and saurischians, simply an attempt to follow anatomical naming conventions.

The anterior articular surface is trapezoidal in anterior view, and the posterior articular surface of the centrum is subcircular in posterior view; the vertebra is platycoelous (Fig. 3C-D) . The body of the centrum is slightly arched anteriorly, and the posterior articular surface is inclined anteriorly at ~45\u00b0 (Fig.  3A-B) . The parapophyses are confluent with the anterior articular surface of the centrum (Fig. 3A-C) ; the diapophyses cannot be distinguished. Only the right prezygapophysis is preserved, and it extends well beyond the centrum ( Fig. 3A-B ), though we are unsure whether this portion of the vertebra has been reconstructed correctly. A prominent band of clay connects the prezygapophysis and the spinoprezygapophyseal lamina to the rest of the neural arch, and we could not identify any solid (bone to bone) contacts. However, when viewed dorsally (Fig. 3E) , the color and taper of the specimen indicate that it is recon- structed properly. The articular surface of the prezygapophysis is elliptical, with the long-axis oriented anterodorsally to posteroventrally. Neither the anterior nor the posterior neural canal opening can be distinguished. The neural spine is incomplete, with a clear break near its base ( Fig. 3E ), but CASE (1927, pl. 1), in his reconstruction, placed small fragments of neural spines over cervicals 3 through 5. We interpret the placement and association of these neural spine fragments as conjectural, as the base of the neural spine of cervical 3 indicates a much shorter neural spine than is seen in CASE's (1927) reconstruction. Thus, although we have included them in our photographs of the entire specimen ( Fig. 1A-B ), we do not include them in our photographs of individual vertebra and will not describe them in detail. On cervical 3, the spinopostzygapophyseal lamina and the transpostzygapophyseal lamina form a pocket medial to the postzygapophyses (Fig. 3D-E) . A prominent cleft is present in the transpostzygapophyseal lamina (Fig. 3E ).",

Transitional 1 is the anteriormost vertebra with a reasonably complete neural spine. The centrum is platycoelous, and its ventral surface is arched symmetrically in lateral view, in contrast to the cervical centra, which have an anteriorly offset arch. Also, the overall shape of the centra differ -the cervical centra are approximately three times as long anteroposteriorly as they are tall dorsoventrally, in contrast to the transitional centra, which are 1 to 1.5 times as long as they are tall. The completeness of the right prezygapophysis cannot be evaluated given the preservation of the specimen. There are extensive laminae both anterior and posterior to the neural spine dorsal to the pre-and postzygapophysis ( Fig. 3T ). These are probably the spinopre-and postzygapophyseal laminae of WILSON (1999) , but the preservation of the specimen precludes further description of these features. Also, a prominent fossa is developed lateral to the base of the neural spine. This fossa is roughly U-shaped and is bounded anteriorly by the prezygapophyses and posteriorly by the postzygapophysis. No transverse process can be distinguished. The neural spine is elongate and rod-like with thin, sheet-like lateral projections.",

The neural spine is still embedded in plaster ( Fig. 4A ), whereas the centrum and neural arch were removed for study . Portions of the centrum have been reconstructed, most notably on the left side where a bone fragment has been affixed to it using clay ( Fig. 4C ). This bone fragment does not appear to be in articulation, so we do not consider it to be a morphologic feature. The centrum appears identical to the centrum of transitional 1. Only the right prezygapophysis is preserved, and it is sub-triangular with its articular surface angled toward the midline. The neural canal is circular. Spinoprezygapophyseal laminae are present, but are considerably smaller than the spinopostzygapophyseal laminae. The anterior face of the base of the neural spine has a prominent cleft in it that continues dorsally. However, this feature could not be traced along its entire length due to the incompleteness of the vertebra and the fact that the neural spine is still embedded in plaster. It should be noted that a change in cross-sectional morphology along the neural spine is described by CASE (1927, fig. 3 ), but we could not corroborate his interpretation on any of the neural spines because either the vertebrae were still incased in plaster or were so heavily reconstructed as to prevent definitive analysis. The diapophyses are thin slats of bone extending off of the neural arch ( Fig. 4B-C) , at the level of the base of the neural spine; they are not as well developed as the transverse processes of more posterior dorsal vertebrae. The fossa lateral to the base of the neural spine, noted in transitional 1, is more developed in this vertebra and is V-shaped in lateral view ( Fig. 4B-C) . The posterior neural arch is difficult to interpret, due to incomplete preparation. The right postzygapophysis is missing, but the articular surface of the left postzygapophysis is polygonal and inclined at a high, nearly vertical angle ( Fig. 4G) . A cleft is present in the transpostzygapophyseal lamina ( Fig. 4D ), but the extent and detailed morphology of this lamina cannot be determined due to the incomplete preparation of this specimen.",

This reconstruction has offset the posterior neural arch and neural spine posteriorly. The centrum appears similar to the more anterior dorsal centra. The prezygapophyses are large, rounded and more blunt than prezygapophyses of the more anterior dorsal vertebrae ( Fig. 4H, K) . Also, they are inclined at a high angle, nearly vertically towards the midline. A distinct figure-eight-shaped fossa is present at the anterior base of the neural spine between the prezygapophyses. This fossa is floored by the lamina between the prezygapophyses (a lamina not named or distinguished by WILSON 1999, but best referred to as the transprezygapophyseal lamina) and bounded dorsally by the spinoprezygapophyseal laminae (Fig. 4K ). The anterior neural canal is large and elliptical, with the long axis oriented mediolaterally, and more distinct than in any of the more anterior cervical or dorsal vertebrae. The neural canal is not visible in posterior view due to reconstruction of the specimen (Fig. 4L ). The fossa lateral to the neural spine is subtriangular in dorsal view ( Fig. 4I ) and is clearly bounded by the spinoprezygapophyseal lamina anteriorly and spinopostzygapophyseal lamina posteriorly. These laminae extend toward each other and meet at the medial end of the transverse process ( Fig. 4I ). From this meeting point, a lamina extends laterally on the dorsal surface of the transverse process; this lamina is not analogous to the spinodiapophyseal lamina of WILSON (1999) , because it does not extend directly from the neural spine to the transverse process. We use the term dorsal diapophyseal lamina for this feature. Transitional 3 is the anteriormost vertebra to preserve prominent transverse processes, which are rectangular in dorsal view ( Fig.  4I ) and appear as comma-shaped in lateral view (Fig. 4H) . The neural spine, as in transitional 2, has a prominent an- terior cleft that extends along the lower half of the spine's height; the upper half of the spine has a single anterior ridge (Fig. 4K ). The left postzygapophysis is missing, but the right is present and is well above the level of the prezygapophyses and the rest of the neural arch. Also, it is very close to the posterior base of the neural spine, with a very short spinopostzygapophyseal lamina connecting the neural spine and the postzygapophysis (Fig. 4L ).",

The centrum is considerably shorter than the cervical centra of the holotype (Figs. 1, 3A-S) and more closely resembles the dorsals of the holotype (Figs. 3T, 4-7) . Thus, we interpret this vertebra as a transitional vertebra between the cervical and dorsal series.

Prominent pre-and postzygadiapophyseal and anterior and posterior centrodiapophyseal laminae are present, giving the neural arch an X-shape in lateral view. Also, there is an accessory lamina between the dorsal edge of the anterior articular surface of the centrum and the anteromedial base of the prezygapophyses. A fossa is formed between this accessory lamina and the anterior centrodiapophyseal lamina. The prezygapophyses are triangular and are taller than the postzygapophyses. The articular faces of the prezygapophyses face towards the base of the neural spine. The neural spine of the transitional vertebra differs from the dorsal neural spines of the holotype. The neural spine is rod-like with an elliptical (long axis oriented mediolaterally) cross section and thin, sheetlike lamina projecting laterally from the sides of the spine.

In Spinosuchus this is especially prominent in the postzygapophyses of the cervical series (Fig. 3E, K, Q) , which are significantly wider than the width of the centrum. However, this feature is less clear in the cervical prezygapophyses, which are either incomplete or appear to have a width that is approximately equal to that of the centrum. In the dorsal vertebrae the flaring of both pre-and postzygapophyses is clear in those vertebrae that can be examined in dorsal view, e. g., transitional vertebrae 1, 2 and dorsals 1, 2, 9, 13 (Figs. 4D, I, P, 5E, 6G, P, respectively) . In Trilophosaurus, all of the presacral vertebrae have pre-and postzygapophyses that flare out laterally further than the width of the centrum, except in the atlas where only the prezygapophyses flare (SPIEL-MANN et al. 2008, figs. 30-47) . This flaring is also present in the sacral and the proximal ten caudal vertebrae of T. buettneri. At the eleventh caudal vertebrae, the centra become more cylindrical, and the pre-and postzygapophyses, while slightly flared, are not as extensive as in more anterior caudals (SPIELMANN et al. 2008, figs. 48-63) . This is also true in the few identified dorsal and proximal caudal vertebrae of T. jacobsi (SPIELMANN et al. 2008, figs. 94-98) .",

In Spinosuchus this transition occurs between dorsals 6 and 7 (the tenth and eleventh vertebrae of the holotype series), as originally reported by RICHARDS (1999: 52). However, in T. buettneri this transition occurs between the transitional vertebrae (the seventh through ninth vertebrae of the series) and the dorsal vertebrae (tenth through twenty-fifth vertebrae of the holotype series). RICHARDS (1999: 45) identified the seventh through ninth vertebra of the preserved series of S. caseanus as possible transitional vertebrae, based on the position of the diapophyses and morphology of the various neural spine laminae, whereas we have identified the cervical and dorsal vertebrae based primarily on centra morphology and shape and height of the neural arch, following SPIELMANN et al. (2008) . This results in both Spinosuchus and Trilophosaurus having this transition occurring near the beginning of the dorsal series, with an abrupt transition from a parapophysis low on the centrum and a diapophysis on the neural arch to a single diapophysis, instead of the parapophyses progressively being higher and higher on the centrum in progressively more posterior vertebrae.",

Tanystropheus does possess prominent processes above the postzygapophyses of the cervical series, though these are difficult to interpret as there is not a single, expansive neural spine, but two small, triangular spinose processes (WILD 1973 , fig. 38a ). However, in Tanystropheus these processes above the postzygapophyses extend anteriorly, contacting the lateral margin of the neural arch, not these spinose processes.",

Some vertebrae have been mirrored so that anterior is towards the left margin. toral vertebrae do have complete neural arches, and they do not possess transpostzygapophyseal laminae (GOWER 2003, fig. 22a ). The cervical and dorsal vertebrae of Ornithosuchus longidens are illustrated almost entirely in lateral view (WALKER 1964, fig. 8) , with a single exception ( fig. 8i ), which is in anterior view. Thus, the presence of transpostzygapophyseal laminae cannot be assessed based on illustrated specimens; however, nowhere in the detailed description of these vertebrae are any laminae between the postzygapophyses noted. Tanystropehus does possess a lamina between the cervical postzygapophyses (WILD 1973, figs. 39-46) . However, this lamina appears to be related to providing the dorsal margin of the neural canal; it is not as extensive as the transpostzygapophyseal laminae of Trilophosaurus or Spinosuchus, which extend well beyond the posterior margin of the neural canal and centrum. Thus, we note this feature in Tanystropheus for completeness, but hesitate to refer to it as a transpostzygapophyseal lamina.",

No cervical vertebrae have been described or illustrated for Rhynchosaurus spenceri (BENTON 1990) or Sikannisuchus (NICHOLLS et al. 1998) . Given that none of the archosauromorph taxa we compared to Spinosuchus and Trilophosaurus could be demonstrated to possess transpostzygapophyseal laminae, we conclude that none of the comparative taxa could possess a cleft in these laminae.",

However, the anterior centrodiapophyseal laminae extend directly from the diapophysis to the dorsal margin of the centrum in trilophosaurids, whereas in Erythrosuchus this lamina appears to connect the diapophysis with the parapophysis. We note the shift in the position of the lamina and how it corresponds to the shift in position of the parapophysis between anterior and more posterior dorsal vertebrae (GOWER 2003, compare fig. 23b  to fig. 24a ). In addition, these laminae disappear in more posterior dorsal vertebrae of Erythrosuchus as the paraand diapophyses become more confluent (GOWER 2003, compare fig. 24a and fig. 24b ). The posterior centrodiapophyseal laminae of trilophosaurids extends from the diapophysis to the dorsal margin of the centrum, whereas similar laminae in Erythrosuchus never reach the margins of the centra (GOWER 2003, figs. 23b, 24a-b) . A postzygadiapophyseal lamina is present in Erythrosuchus only in medial and posterior dorsal vertebrae, not throughout the dorsal series as in trilophosaurids. Tanystropheus possesses prezygadiapophyseal, anterior centrodiapophyseal and posterior centrodiapophyseal laminae similar to trilophosaurids (WILD 1973, figs. 52-54) . However, the lamina that extends posteriorly from the dorsal margin of the diapophyses does not contact the postzygapophyses, and thus cannot be termed a postzygadiapophyseal lamina. Postosuchus has similar laminae that are in the same position as the anterior centrodiapophyseal laminae, but serve only to connect the para-and diapophyses (CHATTERJEE 1985, fig. 12-10b, 12a, 15b) .",

In Hyperodapedon the prezygapophyses of dorsal 1 flare dorsally and laterally, though not as far outward as in trilophosaurids. This flaring diminishes as one moves farther back in the dorsal series of Hyperodapedon and is not pronounced in the postzygapophyses (BENTON 1983, fig.  22b, d ). The dorsals of R. articeps have pre-and postzygapophyses that flare laterally farther than the width of the centrum, but are relatively flat compared to trilophosaurids (BENTON 1990, fig. 10b, c) . These similarities are not surprising given the hypothesized close phylogenetic relationship between trilophosaurids and rhynchosaurids (SPIELMANN et al. 2008 and references cited therein).",

The KAHLE Trilophosaurus quarry is stratigraphically low in the Trujillo Formation and yields a large collection of T. jacobsi cranial and postcranial material and is late Adamanian (Lamyan) in age (HECKERT et al. 2001 (HECKERT et al. , 2006 SPIELMANN et al. 2007a SPIELMANN et al. , 2008 . Thus, Spinosuchus is currently a taxon restricted in age to the Adamanian land-vertebrate-faunachron.",
