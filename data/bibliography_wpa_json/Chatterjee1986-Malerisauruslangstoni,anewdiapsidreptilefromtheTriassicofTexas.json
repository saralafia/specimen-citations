The skull is diapsid with an incomplete lower temporal arcade and a fixed quadrate. A similar configuration of the cheek region is known in many long-necked Permo-Triassic protorosaurs (= Prolacertiformes) that paralleled the squamates in the loss of lower temporal bar without any phyletic relationships to the latter group. The protorosaurs were very successful during the Permo-Triassic period, being recorded from all continents except South America. The number of neck vertebrae and its length are diagnostic characters for classifying the two families of protorosaurs. The family Protorosauridae (including Protorosaurus, Prolacerta, Kadimakara, Macrocnemus, Ma/erisaurus and the unnamed Yerrapalli form) has a moderately long neck, with 8 vertebrae. The family Tanystropheidae (including Tanystropheus and Tanylrache/os) has an extremely long neck with 12 vertebrae. The ankle structure is the most important derived feature that distinguishes protorosaurs, rhynchosaurs, and trilophosaurs from the traditional lepidosaurs, and unites them with archosaurs in a larger assemblage, the Archosauromorpha.",

From 1939 From -1941 , a large collection of Dockum vertebrates was made by the crews ofthe Works Projects Administration (WPA), near Otis Chalk, 25 kilometers southeast of Big Spring, Howard County, Texas. The fossils were collected from four quarries located within an area of 5 square kilometers ( Fig. 1) and have become part of the vertebrate paleontology collection at the Texas Memorial Museum (TMM). Taxa established from this collection comprise parasuchids (Gregory, 1962; Shelton, 1984) , aetosaurs (Sawin, 1947) , trilophosaurs (Gregory, 1945; Parks, 1969) , metoposaurs (Sawin, 1945) , rhynchosaurs (Elder, 1978) , captorhinomorphs (Elder, 1978) , poposaurs (Chatterjee, 1985) , and 1abyrinthodonts (Wilson, 1948) .",

The material is so similar to Maferisaurus (Chatterjee, 1980) from India in size, proportions, and gross morphology that there is little doubt about its generic identity. This find is remarkable because it represents the first protorosaurid reptile from North America and establishes its relationships with other diapsid genera.",

The quarry was prospected again in 1983 by the author, but it did not produce any notable material. The diapsid material (TMM 31099-11) represents a fairly complete and articulated skeleton. The skull is somewhat crushed, and the anterior part is missing; nevertheless it reveals many diagnostic features, especially in the temporal region , that permit a reassessment of its phylogenetic relationships. A smaller individual is represented by isolated limb bones and vertebrae. Dr. Wann Langston, Jr., Director of the Vertebrate Paleontology Laboratory of the Texas Memorial Museum, kindly gave me permission to prepare and study the material.",

From the comparisons oflimb proportions and short trunk region, it was concluded that Malerisaurus was capable of running bipedally, when occasion demanded, as effectively as some of the extant lizards such as Basiliscus and Chlamydosaurus.

The specimens were recovered from Quarry 2 (Gregory, 1945) , Otis Chalk locality of Howard County. Here the dominant lithology is red mudstone intercalated with lenses of fine-grained sandstones and conglomerates. Quarry 1 and Quarry 2 are only 100 meters apart, and the fauna is dominated by well-preserved, mostly terrestrial vertebrates (such as Trilophosaurus, Latiscopus, and Malerisaurus) with a few aquatic members (Metoposaurus and Unio).

In Quarry I most of the taxa represent adult forms whereas in Quarry 2 juvenile or small -sized animals were dominant. The associated nature of the skeletons indicate that they were not sorted by hydraulic action. This distinct size difference between two quarries may indicate different niches or segregations between young (or small) and adult (or large) groups, and may suggest seasonal reproduction and gregarious habits (Elder, 1978) . Chatterjee (1980) speculated on the mode of life of Malerisaurus in the Triassic environment. Malerisaurus is comparable to modem bipedal lizards in size, proportions, and inferred activities. It was essentially a land-dweller and probably lived most of the time on the margins of rivers, lakes, and ponds. However, it could possibly climb trees or take to the water like the modem basilisk when alarmed. The diet probably consisted of small clams, snails and insects or anything it could swallow whole, as is evident from the dentition.",

Kadimakara , a new Prolacerta-like genus from the early Triassic of Queensland, Australia ( Bartholomai, 1979) , should be added to this group. Wild (1980) independently came to a similar conclusion on the basis of restudy of Tanystropheus. He grouped Prolacerta, Macrocnemus, Tanystropheus, and Protorosaurus within the suborder Prolacertiformes. However, he considered Prolacertiformes as squamates. Gow (1975) , Carroll (1975 Carroll ( ,1977 Carroll ( ,1981 , Chatterjee (1980) , and Evans (1980) pointed out that neither Prolacerta nor any of its allies are squamates regardless of the configuration of the cheek. The loss of the lower temporal arcade does not necessarily indicate squamate affinity. Clearly this feature evolved independently in many diverse diapsid groups including Prolacerta (Camp, 1945) , Gephyrosaurus (Evans, 1980) , sphenodontids (Robinson, 1973) , nothosaurs (Carroll, 1981) , and millerettids (Gow, 1972) . The primitive squamate features, such as short cervicals, ossified sternum, and anteriorly fenestrate scapulo-coracoid, are lacking in Prolacertiformes, and consequent- ly this group is considered herein as non-squamate diapsid. It appears that during the Permian and Triassic periods, these small reptiles occupied niches that were subsequently taken by the squamates in the Jurassic and later times.",

                "text": "Protorosaurus and Malerisaurus have been placed in the same family, Protorosauridae (Chatterjee, 1980) . At that time, the nature of the cheeks of these two genera was uncertain because of incomplete material, and it was assumed that the lower temporal arcade in both genera was complete. In contrast, the Prolacertidae has an open cheek. On the basis ofnew evidence, I now think that both of my earlier assumptions were wrong. The present study clearly indicates that in Malerisaurus the lower temporal arcade has been breached. This contention is further supported by another line The genus Protorosaurus is one ofthe earliest known fossil reptiles, being first recorded in 1706 from the Permian deposits of Thuringia, Germany. It was studied by many eminent paleontologists including von Meyer, Cuvier, Owen, and Huxley. Seeley (1888) described the animal and reconstructed the skull as a diapsid with an open cheek. The systematic position of Protorosaurus has been debated for over a century because the structure of the skull-and especially the structure of the temporal region-has never been satisfactorily described. Recently Dr. Rupert Wild has prepared new material of Protorosaurus and kindly provided me with the following information. \"The skull JVP 6(4), December 1986 is diapsid with reduced lower temporal bar. The parietal foramen is present. Implantation ofteeth is fully thecodont.\" This new information settles the affinity of Protorosaurus. In my earlier paper, I used the presence or absence of the lower temporal bar as the principal character to differentiate the Protorosauridae from the Prolacertidae. If both groups have an open cheek, the two families become indistinguishable. In that case , Protorosauridae Lydekker (1888) becomes the senior synonym of Prolacertidae Parrington (1935) . Such a close relationship between Prolacerta and Protorosaurus was earlier suggested by Camp (1945) . He compared the two genera in detail, united them in the famil y Protorosauridae, and erected a new order Prolacertiformes to receive the family. He substituted the name Protorosauria for Eosuchia (as the root \"suchia\" means crocodile) and elevated its status to a PROTOROSAURIA '\" '\"",

Romer (1947 Romer ( , 1956 Romer ( , 1966 denied this close tie between Prolacerta and Protorosaurus, and grouped Protorosaurus with Araeoscelis in the order Araeoscelidia, believing that Protorosaurus had a solid cheek . However, he used the term Prolacertiformes as a suborder to receive the sole family Prolacertidae within the order Eosuchia, maintaining that Eosuchia is a valid term. There are other non-crocodilian Triassic diapsid groups bearing comparable names: Parasuchia, Pseudosuchia, and Omithosuchia. Most of the current workers concur with Camp's argument for assigning Protorosaurus to the Prolacerta group, but they continue to use the ordinal name Eosuchia as suggested by Romer (Chatterjee, 1980; Carroll, 1981; Wild, 1980; Evans , 1980) . Dr. Wild's new observation confirms the close relationship between Prolacerta and Protorosaurus and favors the inclusion ofthese related genera into a single family Protorosauridae. This measure raises the question of the validity of the name Prolacertiformes. The name Protorosauria Huxley, 1871, has a clear priority over Prolacertiformes Camp, 1945 , in referring to Protorosaurus and its allies , and can be retained as an order within the primitive diapsids. Carroll (1981) recommended a similar taxonomic scheme for this group of reptiles. The taxon Eosuchia is in fact a \"catch-all\" suborder for primitive diapsid reptiles of uncertain relationship. In recent times, our understanding of these animals has improved tremendously, and more meaningful classifications are emerging. Many of the so-called eosuchian genera have been transferred to squamates and rhynchosaurs (Carroll, 1976 (Carroll, , 1977 . Currently, however, the Eosuchia is used in a restricted sense to include only the Younginidae and the Tangasauridae (Currie, 1982) . Gow (1975) first pointed out that the affinities of protorosaurs lie with the archosaurs rather than with the lepidosaurs. Thulborn (1980) and Brinkman (1981) showed that the primitive mesotarsal (PM) joint, as exemplified by Proterosuchus, was also a feature in protorosaurs, rhynchosaurs, trilophosaurs, and protorosaurs. They suggested that these reptiles are members of a single radiation. Benton (1983) concluded that the rhynchosaurs, trilophosaurs, and protorosaurs shared a common ancestry with archosaurs and included these groups in a larger assemblage, the Archosauromorpha (von Huene, 1946) .",

The discovery of a diapsid reptile, Petrolacosaurus. from the Late Pennsylvanian of Kansas (Reisz, 1981) lends support to the idea that the Diapsida forms a valid taxon and may be reinstated as a subclass including Archosauromorpha and Lepidosauromorpha as its infraclasses (Benton, 1983) .",

                "text": "Recently Evans (1984) and Benton (1984 Benton ( , 1985 used cladistic techniques to review relationships amongst major diapsid groups. They recognized two distinct lineages among diapsids: the Archosauromorpha (including Rhynchosauria, Prolacertiformes, Archosauria , and Pterosauria) and the Lepidosauromorpha (including Younginiformes, Sphenodontia, and Squamata). Basically I agree with their character analysis and classification. It has already been pointed out above that the name Protorosauria has a priority over Prolacertiformes, and the former name is preferred in this discussion. Also , the trilophosaurs share many derived characters with rhynchosaurs and are considered here as sister groups. The relationships ofmajor groups of archosauromorphs are presented in the form of a cladogram (Fig. 9) . My emphasis here has been mainly oriented toward protorosaurs, in order to document how they share derived characters with rh ynchosaurs and trilophosaurs on one hand, and with primitive archosaurs (such as Proterosuchidae) on the other. As a result, detailed discussions on archosaurs and pterosaurs have been omitted. The cladogram is a tentative statement ofrelationships that is readily open to testing and modification by future work. It appears from this analysis that protorosaurs are distinctive groups within the archosauromorphs, and can be diagnosed by the following synapomorphies: I) loss of lower temporal arcade with reduction of quadratojugal; 2) elongated cervicals with low neural spine and mid-ventral keel; 3) gracile body form with strong limb disparity.",

The placing of Macrocnemus within the two families of protorosaurs becomes difficult. Macrocnemus is considered here as a member of the Protorosauridae because of possessing the same number of cervical vertebrae and a similar dentition. However, there are two apparent synapomorphies between Macrocnemus and Tanystropheus: low, largely ventral shoulder girdle, and large thyroid fenestra between pubis and ischium (Benton, 1985) . These similarities could be attributed to their exploitation of the same ecologic niches. Both were adapted to marine life, and consequently their girdle bones became reduced. All other protorosaurs have been found in continental sediments.",
