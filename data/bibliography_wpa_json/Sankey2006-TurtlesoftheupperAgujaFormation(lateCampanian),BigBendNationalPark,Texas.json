    "abstract": "The Late Cretaceous vertebrates from Big Bend National Park, Texas are some of the southern most vertebrates from the Western Interior of North America. These fossils provide important information on the distinctiveness of the southern vertebrates. Turtle fossils (388 specimens) were collected from 13 sites in the upper shale member of the Aguja Formation (late Campanian) of Big Bend. Turtles include: Baenidae indet., cf. Hoplochelys, Adocus, Basilemys, trionychids, and cf. Helopanoplia. The most abundant turtles are the trionychids (8 I%), with all others less than 10%; Adocus (6%), Basilemys (6%), baenid (5%) and kinostemoid (1%). The Aguja turtle assemblage is similar, but possibly more diverse, than that of the contemporaneous Fruitland and Kirtland turtle fauna of New Mexico. Turtles are sensitive proxies to paleoclimatic change; higher turtle diversity has been shown to correspond to warmer climates. This trend continues in the Big Bend turtle record, and detailed paleoclimatic reconstructions were compared with turtle diversity. The highest turtle diversity occurred in the late Campanian and the lowest diversity in the Maastrichtian. Outcro~ of Late Cretaceous arty Tertiary sediments within Big Bend National Park.",

                "text": "The Aguja Formation is a widespread sedimentary unit in Big Bend. It is an eastward thinning deposit composed of 135 to 285 meters of sandstones interbedded with shale and lignite. Environments ofdeposition vary from marine, paralic, to inland floodplain (Lehrnan, 1985) . The upper shale member represents the last of the pre-Laramide tectonic sedimentation in the area (Lehman, 1991) , and records the final marine regression of the Western Interior Sea from west Texas (Regression 8 of Kauffman, 1977) . The lower part of this member contains carbonaceous mudstones, thin beds of lignite, and large siderite ironstone concretions representing distributary channels, levees, crevasse splays, and poorly drained interdistributary marshes and bays. The upper part of this member, with variegated mudstones and sandstones containing conglomeratic lags of palm-caliche nodules, represents fluvial environments within a deltaic coastal floodplain and inland floodplain. A variety of well-developed paleosols formed on the inland floodplain of the upper Aguja and overlying Javelina Formations, and their stage of development has been linked to sea level fluctuations in the nearby Western Interior Seaway (Atchley et al., 2004) Typical large vertebrates from the lower part of the upper Aguja are the giant crocodilian Deinosuchus riograndensis and the homed dinosaur Chasmosaums mariscalensis, the hadrosaur Kritosaurus sp. is more abundant higher in the upper Aguja (Lehman, 1985) . All are known from quarries with associated skeletons.",

The Aguja baenids differ from those in Alberta in having a more knobby sculpture on their shell (Brinkman, pers. comm., 2005) ; most of the Alberta baenid specimens are Neurankylus.

Their fossils are easily recognized by their distinctive shell sculpture patterns of numerous pits of various shapes and sizes surrounded by ridges andlor grooves surrounded by ridges (Peng et al., 2001 ). Tomlinson (1997) recognized four morphotypes of Aspideretoides based on differences in ornamentation, shell thickness, and size. However, small-scale features of sculpture ornamentation are not significant at lower taxonomic levels (Estes, 1964; Nicholls, 1972; Gaffney, 1979; Gardner and Russell, 1994) , and only more complete elements that demonstrate overall patterns of sculpturing and shape can be ascribed to species (Gardner et a]., 1995) . A variety of trionychid taxa have been reported from Late Cretaceous deposits of the western U.S. (e.g., Gardner et al. 1995; Brinkman, 2005; Mateer, 198 1; Gilmore, 19 16,1938; Hay, 1908a ) and many of the specimens referred here may be assignable to the most common genus, Aspideretoides.

The southern province, from southern Colorado to the south, was characterized by the Normapolles palynoflora, and had a warm climate with opencanopy woodlands (Lehman and Wheeler, 2001 ; Wheeler and Lehrnan, 2000) . In contrast, the northern province, from southern Colorado to the north, was characterized by the Aquillapolleniles palynoflora, and had a temperate and more humid climate, with a more closed-canopy forest (Nichols and Sweet, 1993) . Rainfall and temperature differences were the main factors that produced these north-south biogeographic patterns (Baghai, 1996; Lehman, 1997) . (For a differing opinion on Late Cretaceous provinces, see Sullivan and Lucas, 2003.) Big Bend in the late Campanian to mid-Maastrichtian was at -35 degrees N paleo-latitude (Robinson-Roberts and Kirschbaum, 1995) , and the Western Interior Seaway was nearby (Atchley et al., 2004) .",

Big Bend is critical in understanding the southern province because it contains some of the southernmost Late Cretaceous vertebrate fossils in North America. There are some important differences between the two. First, because Big Bend was relatively distant from uplands in the late Campanian, the area had slower sedimentation rates compared to northern areas, resulting in condensed stratigraphic and faunal records in Big Bend (Lehman, 1991) . Second, increased aridity, due to retreat of the western Interior Seaway and uplift of western mountains, occurred in Big Bend earlier (late Campanian) than in the north and was an important influence on its paleocommunities. Evidence for aridity in Big Bend comes from dinosaur bonebeds from the upper Aguja that formed during periodic droughts severe enough to cause marshes to dry up (Davies and Lehman, 1989) . Further evidence is from the numerous carbonate-cemented and pedogenic nodule rich conglomeratic channel lag deposits in the upper Aguja and Javelina formations (Sankey, 1998; Schiebout et al., 1997) .",

These taxonomic differences are probably partly due to the distinct differences in climate between the northern and southern areas, with periodic aridity occurring earlier in Big Bend than in northern areas. Understanding the effects of climate change on the Late Cretaceous terrestrial ecosystems is important in order to separate the terrestrial from extraterrestrial factors involved in the Cretaceousflertiary extinctions.

For example, she argues that the highest turtle diversity, from the Aguja, was due to the abundance of favorable turtle habitats within the coastal floodplain environments of the upper Aguja. She explains the lowest turtle diversity, from the Javelina, to be a result of less favorable turtle habitats within the inland floodplain and that the increase in turtle diversity in the lower Black Peaks was due to the return of favorable habitats within the more coastal floodplain environments. However, paleoclimate and paleoenvironments are closely linked. During cooler drier climates, sea level lowered, ground water tables dropped, and the inland floodplain environments contained fewer favorable turtle habitats. Change in Big Bend turtle diversity is likely a result of both paleoclimatic and paleoenvironmental changes. Highest turtle diversity, in the upper Aguja, corresponds to higher temperatures, a high stand in sea level (TE2 ofAtchley et al., 2004) , and to abundant favorable habitats within the coastal and near coastal inland floodplain. In contrast, the lowest turtle diversity, in the Javelina Formation, corresponds to a general trend of decreasing temperatures during the Maastrichtian, with two short spikes of higher temperatures, from 70 to 69 Ma and from 65.5 to 65 Ma (Nordt et al., 2003) . This corresponds to a decrease in habitats further on the inland floodplain, during a time of lower sea levels (HFE2).",

The first evidence for periodic aridity in the terrestrial record of Big Bend starts in the late Campanian. There are several lines of evidence for this aridity. One, the dinosaur bonebeds from the upper Aguja formed during periodic droughts severe enough to cause marshes to dry up (Davies and Lehrnan, 1989) . Second, numerous carbonate-cemented and pedogenic nodule rich conglomeratic channel lag deposits occur the upper Aguja (Sankey, 1998; Schiebout et al., 1997) . Third, well-developed paleosols containing abundant carbonate nodules occur in the upper Aguja; they first appear within the inland floodplain facies. At Rattlesnake Mountain, the start of this facies occurs immediately above the \"Purple Hill\" microsites. However, seasonally arid conditions became more intense and frequent in the Javelina Formation, as indicated by the numerous and large paleosols carbonate nodules and by the abundant vertisols (Atchley et al., 2004) .",

The late Campanian turtle assemblage described here represents a snapshot of the final \"healthy\" Big Bend vertebrate paleocommunity before climatic and environmental changes occurred in this area in the late Carnpanian-early Maastrichtian. Directly above the level of this assemblage, the sediments of the uppermost Aguja and the Javelina Formations change to inland floodplain deposits, with well-developed paleosols and with abundant paleocaliche nodules. This boundary marks, in this area, the start of more severe seasonal aridity, loss of favorable turtle habitat, and a decrease in turtle diversity. Both the climatic and environmental changes resulted in loss of turtle habitats for many of the typical Aguja turtles.",
