A nearly complete left side of the skull and incomplete but articulated mandible of a juvenile individual demonstrate that Trilophosaurus jacobsi Murry is referable to Trilophosaurus, so the putative procolophonid genus Chinleogomphius is a junior objective synonym of Trilophosaurus. Features of T. jacobsi that diagnose it from T. buettneri include asymmetrical, tricuspate teeth in which the central cusp is taller than the marginal cusp, polygonal in cross-section and displaced slightly lingually; the lingual cusp is low, transversely broadened and anteroposteriorly compressed; teeth with prominent cingula along the mesial and distal margins; and paired sagittal (parasagittal) crests composed of portions of the postfrontals and the parietals, as well as a relatively broad skull roof between the supratemporal fenestrae. We also re-illustrate and re-describe the holotypes of both Trilophosaurus buettneri Case and T. jacobsi Murry. T. jacobsi is primarily Adamanian in age, and the lowest occurrence of T. jacobsi is stratigraphically above that of T. buettneri. Therefore, T. buettneri is an Otischalkian-Adamanian index taxon, and T. jacobsi is an Adamanian-?earliest Revueltian index taxon. Trilophosaurus teeth are readily identifiable to species and therefore identifiable as isolated fossils.",

                "text": "During Triassic time, continental tetrapod faunas changed in composition from temnospondyl-and primitive-synapsid-dominated Early Triassic faunas to archosaur-dominated Late Triassic faunas. An intriguing subplot that is often lost in discussion of this evolutionary transition is the changes that occurred in the nature of some specialized, herbivorous tetrapods. During the Early Triassic, procolophonids comprised a substantial proportion of the herbivorous fauna (as did dicynodonts and gomphodont cynodonts), whereas Late Triassic procolophonids are relatively rare, apparently having been supplanted by herbivorous archosauromorphs, including rhynchosaurs and trilophosaurs (e.g. Benton 1984 Benton , 1991 Reisz and Sues 2000) . Rhynchosaurs are all but unknown in the Upper Triassic of North America (Hunt and Lucas 1991; Long and Murry 1995; Lucas et al. 2002 ), yet in places the trilophosaur Trilophosaurus is abundant. While rhynchosaurs have undergone significant revision in the past two decades (e.g. Benton 1983 Benton , 1984 Benton , 1990 Langer and Schultz 2000; Langer et al. 2000a, b) , the less well-known trilophosaurs have had but one new taxon identified (Murry 1987) , which was subsequently re-identified as a procolophonid (Sues and Olsen 1993) . Even Late Triassic procolophonids in North America have received far more recent attention than trilophosaurs (Sues and Olsen 1993; Small 1997; Sues and Baird 1998; Sues et al. 2000) .",

DeMar and Bolt (1981) described the tooth replacement of Trilophosaurus, again utilizing the sample from Otis Chalk. Murry (1982, 1986) characterized isolated remains, and later (Murry 1987) named a second species of Trilophosaurus, T. jacobsi, for isolated tooth and jaw fragments collected from low in the Chinle Group in east-central Arizona (Text- fig. 1 ). Murry (1989) identified a single occurrence of T. buettneri from high in the Blue Mesa Member of the Petrified Forest Formation, and it is included in Long and Murry's (1995) list of specimens referred to Trilophosaurus. Later, Sues and Olsen (1993) identified T. jacobsi as a probable procolophonid, and proposed the genus name Chinleogomphius for the taxon. Long and Murry (1995) concurred, and re-assigned fossils of Trilophosaurus jacobsi to 'Chinleogomphius' jacobsi.",

This locality yields numerous pinkish-grey disarticulated bones from a matrix of intraformational conglomerate. The principal fossiliferous horizon consists of a moderate brown, clast-supported conglomerate of rounded, flattened, intraformational mud pebbles up to 2 cm in diameter. The matrix is principally a rounded, moderately poorly sorted sublitharenite. This horizon is separated from the underlying moderate brown mudstone along an irregular contact that suggests slight scouring and erosion ( ). Most of the overlying strata are interbedded sandstone, conglomerate and mudstone. Unionid bivalves were collected from the uppermost conglomerate, which is a moderate yellowish-brown intraformational conglomerate dominated by clasts of calcrete and siltstone up to 1AE5 cm in diameter.",

Similarly, the Trujillo Formation throughout this region is considerably more resistant than either the overlying Bull Canyon Formation or the underlying Tecovas Formation. Thus, the Trujillo Formation crops out as either a ledge-former above Tecovas Formation badlands, such as at Muchakoago Peak slightly to the south-east or, alternatively, as a bench flooring broad plains beneath localized exposures and badlands of the Bull Canyon Formation.

They described this section as including a medial interval of sandstone and intrabasinal conglomerate termed 'central beds' by Drake (1892, pl. 5) and subsequently assigned to the Trujillo Formation of Gould (1907) by Reeside et al. (1957) and Finch and Wright (1983) , among others. Underlying mudstones thus are assigned to the Tecovas Formation (e.g. Finch and Wright 1983), and overlying mudstones are termed Bull Canyon Formation (e.g. Lucas et al. 1994 , 2001 . The Trujillo Formation interval at Muchakoago Peak is the same sandstone \u2044 conglomerate interval that encompasses NMMNH locality 3775 to the west. Furthermore, at NMMNH locality 3776, about 9 km south-west of Muchakoago Peak, the Adamanian index aetosaur Stagonolepis occurs in the mudstone-dominated interval below the strata we identify as Trujillo. This occurrence supports assigning these mudstone-dominated strata to the Tecovas Formation, as that unit is of Adamanian age elsewhere (e.g. Lucas et al. 1994 Lucas et al. , 2001 , and indeed includes the type locality of the aetosaur Stagonolepis wellesi (Long and Ballew 1985; Heckert and Lucas 2002) .",

However, we follow Lucas (1998) and note the extreme difficulty of correlating non-marine tetrapod occurrences to a marine timescale. Instead we use his system of land-vertebrate faunachrons (LVF) to denote the age of non-marine Upper Triassic strata. Accordingly, the Tecovas Formation is of well-established Adamanian (latest Carnian) age, based on the occurrence of the Adamanian index taxa Rutiodon (\u00bc Leptosuchus) and Stagonolepis (Lucas and Hunt 1993; Lucas et al. 1994) . The Trujillo Formation is slightly younger. Tetrapod fossils, including the occurrence of Typothorax coccinarum (Hunt 2001; Lucas et al. 2001) , suggest that the Trujillo is of Revueltian (early mid Norian) age, although palynological evidence indicates that the basal Trujillo could be as old as latest Carnian (Dunay and Fisher 1974, 1979; Litwin et al. 1991; Cornet 1993) . Because NMMNH locality 3775 lies above the lowest stratigraphical occurrence of Stagonolepis and Rutiodon but below the lowest occurrence of Typothorax coccinarum (at least locally), we consider it to be latest Adamanian in age.",

Murry 1987chose what he thought was a homologous element, a 'right dentary', for the type specimen of T. jacobsi, facilitating comparison of the two taxa. Two important conclusions of this study are that (1) the holotype of T. jacobsi is an incomplete left maxilla, not a right dentary fragment (see section on T. jacobsi, below); and (2) we do not think that the size difference has taxonomic significance, because we consider the holotype of T. buettneri to represent a juvenile individual (and, by extension, the holotype of T. jacobsi to represent a hatchling individual). fig. 4 ).",

Murry (1987) referred what he considered three dentary fragments (MNA V3193, V3198 and V3199), two maxillary fragments (MNA V3194, V3197) and, tentatively, two isolated teeth (MNA V3195, V3200), to T. jacobsi. We have re-examined these specimens and reject Murry's (1987) assignment of MNA V3195 and V3200 to Trilophosaurus and instead consider them teeth of ornithischian dinosaurs (see below). The other specimens (MNA V3193-V3194, V3197-V3199) are topo-types of T. jacobsi. Table 1 summarizes our interpretation of the original MNA specimens. Because Murry (1987) provided little description of these specimens individually and did not photographically illustrate any of them, we illustrate and re-describe them here in addition to providing the first photographic illustrations of the holotype. Additionally, we illustrate and describe topotype specimens Textfig. 5M ) and refer specimens of 'Chinleogomphius' jacobsi (sensu Heckert 2001) and the Trilophosaurus specimens described by Heckert et al. (2001) to T. jacobsi. The latter include NMMNH P-34073, tooth and P-34372, tooth fragment (Heckert 2001, fig. 5 .11E-F) from NMMNH locality 1430, NMMNH P-34447, tooth fragment, P-34448, tooth fragment, and P-34472, incomplete tooth from NMMNH locality 2739 (see also Heckert 2004). These latter specimens are described later in this paper in the section on biostratigraphy. Many are not diagnostic to species, but given that T. jacobsi is the only known species from that locality, it appears likely that all such specimens pertain to T. jacobsi.",

The lingual cusp is low, transversely expanded, and mesiodistally compressed. The labial cusp has 3-4 denticles on newly erupted teeth that rapidly wear to create a smooth transverse cusp. Murry (1987) already provided detailed descriptions separating teeth of Trilophosaurus from most other grossly similar multicuspid teeth of other tetrapod taxa, and we generally agree with his descriptions.

The holotype of T. jacobsi (Text- fig. 4 ) is a c. 6-mm-long fragment of bone that Murry (1987) interpreted as a right dentary that was broken anteriorly and posteriorly. We interpret the bone as a left maxilla broken anteriorly, posteriorly and dorsally. Five tooth positions are preserved, but only one (the fifth) contains a relatively wellpreserved tooth. The first tooth appears to have been small and nearly circular in cross-section with a diameter of c. 0AE2 mm. The second tooth is somewhat larger (diameter c. 0AE3-0AE4 mm) but similarly simple, albeit more ovate in occlusal cross-section. The third tooth position bears the first transversely broadened tooth, although the tooth itself is broken, so nothing can be said about the size, shape and distribution of cusps, cingula or other features of the crown. Based on the preserved root and base, this tooth was probably c. 1 mm wide and 0AE3 mm long. The fourth tooth is also basically destroyed, but appears to be similarly wide and slightly longer. The fifth tooth position bears the only wellpreserved tooth. This crown is the widest yet (c. 1AE5 mm) but appears to be no longer than was the fourth tooth. The tooth preserves three cusps, with the central cusp taller than either the labial or the lingual cusp. The central cusp is strongly offset toward the labial margin, so that the lingual margin of the cusp is near the centre of the tooth, with the rest of the cusp labial to this point. Both the labial and the lingual cusps are comparatively low, and connected to the central cusp both by a transverse cingulum and by mesial and distal cingula. The central cusp is strongly faceted, so that the worn tip is pentagonal in occlusal view. The combination of labial offset and faceting of the central cusp gives it an asymmetrical pyramidal shape, with a steeper labial margin and more gentle mesial-lingual and distal-lingual slopes. The cingula bounding the facets extend basally to the mesial and distal cingula. This tooth morphology is, as previous authors have noted, more complex than that of T. buettneri. In the following paragraphs we describe the rest of the type series as well as fossils with a similar dentition that we assign to T. jacobsi and that give us the first detailed insight into the craniomandibular and dental anatomy of the species.",

It is significantly wider than the socket anterior to it, but the anterior socket is still much broader than wide, and probably bore a tricuspate tooth in life. The posterior socket is wider still, so in this respect the fragment matches closely the holotype of T. jacobsi. The single preserved tooth appears to be strongly ankylosed to the bone. It is relatively narrow, c. 0AE7 mm wide labiolingually by 1AE0 mm long mesiodistally. Each of the three cusps is connected by a single transverse cingulum and two marginal cingula. The central cusp is very slightly taller than the marginal cusps and slightly offset lingually.

In so doing, we note the extreme difficulty previous authors have experienced in discerning sutural relationships of Trilophosaurus buettneri. Indeed, in Gregory's (1945) reconstruction, incorporated into classic texts by Romer (1956) and Carroll (1988) , essentially no sutures are delineated. Parks (1969) re-studied the WPA samples and superimposed sutures for many skull bones on Gregory's (1945) plates. Merck (1995) presented preliminary evidence that computer-aided tomography (CAT-scan) had provided new insights into the cranial anatomy The new specimen of T. jacobsi we describe here is an articulated, incomplete skull and mandible. The skull is best preserved on the left side, which includes all of the bones except for most of the premaxilla, part of the anterior maxilla and the quadrate, and the ventral margins of the jugal, the quadratojugal and the quadrate. The right side is much less complete, and lacks part or all of all elements except for portions of the frontal, the postfrontal, the parietal and the squamosal. Although laterally compressed and damaged, NMMNH P-41400 preserves well the left side of the skull in both internal and external views (Text- fig. 6A-D) . In overall shape it resembles the skull of T. buettneri (Gregory 1945, figs 2-4, pl. 20, fig. 1; Romer 1956, fig. 88 ), but differs in some key features: (1) the skull roof is not peaked at the lambdoidal crest in T. jacobsi, but instead peaks in a broad arc just posterodorsal to the orbit; (2) the relative size of the orbit of T. jacobsi is much larger than in T. buettneri, although this may be simply due to a difference in ontogenetic age of the specimen we illustrate here relative to specimens illustrated by Gregory (1945) ; and (3) T. jacobsi does not have a single, peaked sagittal crest as in T. buettneri, but instead has two separate parasagittal crests offset from the midline on the right and left sides (Text- fig. 6E-F) . The last of these could conceivably be an ontogenetic difference, although we consider this to be extremely unlikely as this kind of ontogenetic variation is not present in phylogenetically similar taxa such as rhynchosaurs (Benton 1990) , nor is the observed variation in jaw adductor crests on the parietal of Prolacerta (Modesto and Sues 2004) attributable to ontogenetic variation.",

However, a clear suture for the jugal with the postorbital is visible just posterior to the ventral edge of the orbit, as is a squamosal-quadrate suture just posterior to the jugal-postorbital suture. The orbit is rather large (maximum diameter, 22 mm; maximum length, 24 mm). Part of the pterygoid and \u2044 or ectopterygoid is visible in the medial wall of the orbit. Dorsal and posterior to the orbit, a relatively large (maximum diameter, 19 mm) supratemporal fenestra opens dorsally. In the following paragraphs we describe the observed bones of the skull individually.",

Each of the teeth is c. 1AE5 mm long. These teeth increase in width from c. 5AE3 to 7AE6 mm from tooth positions 3 to 8, before decreasing again to c. 5 mm at the end of the tooth row (inferred from the width of the alveolus). The central cusp is the most prominent, and is offset slightly labially from the centre of the tooth. The central cusp is weakly faceted, with two elongate facets on the lingual surface and two shorter facets on the labial side. All of these teeth bear cingula connecting the central cusp to the labial and lingual cusps. They also bear strong cingula distally and mesially. Lingually, the lingual cusp is rimmed by cingula, a feature not reported from T. jacobsi previously, that might serve to distinguish maxillary teeth of T. jacobsi from dentary teeth (described below). The lingual margins of the teeth are aligned so that the lingual cusps are nearly in a straight line anteroposteriorly. Consequently, the labial margin of the tooth row, as well as the arc formed by the central and labial cusps, is convex.",

We do not think this is an ontogenetic feature, as it would require substantial restructuring of the parietal itself, including a medial migration of the jaw musculature, to attain the single crest condition seen in T. buettneri (compare Text-fig. 6E-F with Gregory 1945, fig. 2 ). Modesto and Sues (2004) described some variation in the extent to which the jaw adductor musculature attached dorsally on the parietal of the archosauromorph Prolacerta broomi. However, the differences we document here are substantially greater between the two species of Trilophosaurus recognized here than Modesto and Sues (2004) found in Prolacerta, so we feel justified in using the different organization of the adductor crests (sagittal in T. buettneri, parasagittal in T. jacobsi) as a species-diagnostic feature.",

The cusps are sharply pointed and aligned in a row connected by thin transverse cingula. The teeth are tightly packed and aligned medially, with narrower teeth anteriorly and broader teeth posteriorly, thus forming a labially convex tooth margin. Comparison with both specimens and illustrations of Trilophosaurus buettneri (Gregory 1945, figs 3, 6;  Parks 1969, fig. 2 ) suggest that this element probably represents the anterior portion of the tooth battery of a left maxilla. However, it is also possible that it is the anterior portion of the tooth battery of a right dentary.

Cingula are present on both the mesial and distal margins of this tooth, and evident on the teeth of NMMNH P-29959 as well. Clearly, this tooth is morphologically similar to those of NMMNH P-29959 . The tooth crown is relatively tall, and there is a substantial root that is nearly as tall as the crown. Where the central cusp is preserved, including NMMNH P-29960, it is particularly swollen mesiodistally, so that the lower slopes of the central cusp divide the mesial and distal cingula into labial and lingual segments. This swollen base of the central cusp differs from that of both the type and the WPA specimens of T. buettneri and appears to be unique to T. jacobsi. Damage to the teeth of NMMNH P-29959 and P-29960 prevents us from describing detailed features, such as possible wear facets, with confidence. It is important to note that both P-29959 and P-29960 are substantially larger than P-41400, yet still have a similar overall tooth morphology, especially in terms of the presence and distribution of cingula. This indicates that the tooth characters used to differentiate T. jacobsi from T. buettneri, both by Murry (1987) and as used here, are valid taxonomic differences and not a result of ontogenetic variation (contra Elder 1978 , 1987 and DeMar and Bolt 1981 .",

Murry (1987) and Sues and Olsen (1993) noted that the tooth row is canted in different directions in the holotypes of T. buettneri and T. jacobsi. We suspect that the fragmentary holotype of T. jacobsi is thus actually a left maxilla, not a right dentary.

To facilitate comparison, we propose a standardized nomenclature of Trilophosaurus teeth (Text- fig. 7 ). Trilophosaurus teeth are transversely broadened, with a central cusp flanked by two marginal cusps, the labial and lingual cusps (Text- fig. 7 ). In T. buettneri, the three cusps are connected by a thin ridge or cingulum, the only such ridge on the tooth (Text- fig. 7D, F) . Consequently, the areas between the cusps on the mesial (rostral) and distal (or caudal) faces of the tooth are comprised of poorly defined sulci. We term these the mesial labial, mesial lin-gual, distal labial and distal lingual sulci, respectively. The central cusp, marginal cusp, connecting cingulum and these sulci thus comprise the identifiable features of T. buettneri tooth crowns.",

As in T. buettneri, there is a central cusp, although it is typically displaced somewhat labially and is also generally taller than the marginal cusps, which we still identify as the labial and lingual cusps. The three cusps are still connected by a transverse cingulum. However, there are also cingula across the mesial and distal faces of the tooth, and we term these the mesial and distal cingula. As a result, there are well-defined basins in the same (homologous) area where there are only sulci on T. buettneri teeth. Consequently, on T. jacobsi teeth we identify mesial labial, mesial lingual, distal labial and distal lingual basins, each lying between the transverse cingulum and the marginal (mesial or distal) cingulum. Two other cingula lie on the labial face of the central cusp, one extending down to the mesial cingulum and the other to the distal cingulum. These cingula, combined with the asymmetrical shape and offset of the central cusp, render even fragmentary fossils diagnostic of T. jacobsi. Indeed, these cingula are evident in the one well-preserved tooth on the holotype of T. jacobsi, so regardless of its identification as a right dentary (Murry 1987) or left maxilla (this paper), the distinction between the two species of Trilophosaurus is readily discerned on the two type specimens.",

This fauna is, by definition, Otischalkian in age, and includes the Otischalkian index taxa Metoposaurus, Paleorhinus and Longosuchus. The only other specimens of T. buettneri are isolated teeth from the Kalgary microvertebrate localities and the Petrified Forest National Park. Murry (1982, 1986) identified several teeth of T. buettneri from the lower Kalgary microvertebrate locality. Heckert (2001, 2004 ) also reported T. buettneri from that locality as well as from the upper Kalgary microvertebrate locality. The Kalgary sites are near the base of the Tecovas Formation. The lower Kalgary site may be as old as Otischalkian (Heckert 2001 (Heckert , 2004 but the upper Kalgary locality is clearly of Adamanian age, as the associated fauna includes the phytosaur Rutiodon and the aetosaur Stagonolepis, both index taxa of the Adamanian LVF (Lucas and Luo 1993; Long and Murry 1995) . Murry (1989, fig. 7h ) illustrated a single tooth of T. buettneri from the 'Dying Grounds' locality at the Petrified Forest National Park. The Dying Grounds is in the Blue Mesa Member of the Petrified Forest Formation, and the Dying Grounds fauna is part of the type fauna of the Adamanian LVF of Lucas and Hunt (1993; Lucas 1998) .

These records were based on an isolated tooth and several fragmentary skull bones. We concur that the incomplete tooth, MNA V7064, could represent Trilophosaurus, but it also closely resembles Tricuspisaurus, a possible procolophonid known from fissure fills of similar age in Britain (Robinson 1957; Fraser 1986) . Indeed, a derived leptopleurine procolophonid is known from the same unit (Sues et al. 2000) . MNA V7064 is broken and only preserves two cusps. There are no distal or mesial cingula, and the preserved cusps are subequal in size and shape. These characteristics preclude assignment to T. jacobsi and support assignment to T. buettneri. We are hesitant to do this, however, as it would be an incredible range extension for the taxon. We note two alternative interpretations: (1) MNA V7064 actually pertains to another taxon with multicuspid teeth, perhaps a procolophonid; or (2) it is a tooth of T. buettneri, but represents contamination from another screenwashing site. In support of the first hypothesis, MNA V7064 and Tricuspisaurus are less transversely broad than referred specimens of Trilophosaurus, and thus more closely resemble teeth of procolophonids. The sole evidence supporting the second hypothesis is the fact that Kirby performed his work at the MNA in the mid-to late 1980s, and Tannenbaum (1983) had earlier completed a master's thesis based on MNA's microvertebrate collections obtained by screenwashing the Placerias quarry. Therefore, we consider the apparent Owl Rock record of Trilophosaurus buettneri to be unreliable.",

The type locality, the Placerias quarry in eastern Arizona, is low in the Bluewater Creek Formation (Lucas et al. 1997) and yields many isolated teeth in addition to the tooth-bearing jaw fragments in the type series identified by Murry (1987) . Murry (1982 Murry ( , 1986 was aware of the difference between teeth of T. buettneri and T. jacobsi, and in 1982, referred to teeth of T. jacobsi as 'Variodentoides jacobsi', although later he (Murry 1987) referred only specimens from the type locality to T. jacobsi. Sues and Olsen (1993) did not refer any additional specimens to T. (\u00bc Chinleogomphius) jacobsi, nor did Long and Murry (1995) . Heckert (2001 Heckert ( , 2004 identified isolated teeth of T. (\u00bc Chinleogomphius) jacobsi from both the upper Kalgary microvertebrate localities as well as from the lower Bluewater Creek Formation in western New Mexico, and we illustrate some of these specimens here (Text- fig. 7 ). We also assign some of the specimens Heckert (2001) identified as 'Procolophonidae indet.' to T. jacobsi. A preliminary report on the fauna of NMMNH locality 3775 by Heckert et al. (2001) generally did not identify the specimens to species, but did note the variations in size and considered the fossils from locality 3775 to represent the larger morph. With more material at hand it is now clear that (1) the specimens from locality 3775 pertain to T. jacobsi; and (2) they represent a growth series of T. jacobsi. Detailed investigation of specimens assigned to Trilophosaurus thus demonstrates that T. buettneri is restricted to strata of Otischalkian-early Adamanian age, and that T. jacobsi occurs in strata of Adamanian and, possibly, earliest Revueltian age. It is therefore apparent that both taxa have biostratigraphical utility, because the teeth are identifiable as isolated fossils.",
