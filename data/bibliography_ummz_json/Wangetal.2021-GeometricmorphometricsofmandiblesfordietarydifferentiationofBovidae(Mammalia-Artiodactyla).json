    "abstract": "The mammalian family Bovidae has been widely studied in ecomorphological research, with important applications to paleoecological and paleohabitat reconstructions. Most studies of bovid craniomandibular features in relation to diet have used linear measurements. In this study, we conduct landmark-based geometric-morphometric analyses to evaluate whether different dietary groups can be distinguished by mandibular morphology. Our analysis includes data for 100 species of extant bovids, covering all bovid tribes and 2 dietary classifications. For the first classification with 3 feeding categories, we found that browsers (including frugivores), mixed feeders, and grazers are moderately well separated using mandibular shape. A finer dietary classification (frugivore, browser, browser-grazer intermediate, generalist, variable grazer, and obligate grazer) proved to be more useful for differentiating dietary extremes (frugivores and obligate grazers) but performed equally or less well for other groups. Notably, frugivorous bovids, which belong in tribe Cephalophini, have a distinct mandibular shape that is readily distinguished from all other dietary groups, yielding a 100% correct classification rate from jackknife cross-validation. The main differences in mandibular shape found among dietary groups are related to the functional needs of species during forage prehension and mastication. Compared with browsers, both frugivores and grazers have mandibles that are adapted for higher biomechanical demand of chewing. Additionally, frugivore mandibles are adapted for selective cropping. Our results call for more work on the feeding ecology and functional morphology of frugivores and offer an approach for reconstructing the diet of extinct bovids.",

                "text": "In the literature on ruminant feeding ecology, 3 dietary categories have been widely used. (1) Browsers, in a broad sense, primarily feed on leafy dicotyledonous material or fruits; (2) grass and roughage eaters (the grazers) primarily feed on monocotyledonous material which is generally more abrasive; and (3) intermediate (mixed) feeders feed on a mixture of dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous materials across space and seasons (Hofmann and Stewart 1972) . Each category may be further divided into 2-3 subcategories based on detailed forage selectivity and preference. These categories and subcategories, with slight modifications in terminology and definition, have been widely used to classify the feeding habits of living as well as fossil ruminants (e.g., Gordon and Illius 1988; Janis and Ehrhardt 1988; Langer 1988; Solounias and Dawson-Saunders 1988; Bodmer 1990; Solounias and Moelleken 1993b; Spencer 1995; Dompierre and Churcher 1996; Sponheimer et al. 1999; P\u00e9rez-Barber\u00eda and Gordon 2001; Clauss et al. 2008; Fraser and Theodor 2011a; Forrest et al. 2018; Supplementary Table S1) . A number of studies have alternatively used the percentage of grass in species' diets to quantitatively (as opposed to categorically) place species along the browser-grazer spectrum (e.g., Clauss et al. 2003; P\u00e9rez-Barber\u00eda et al. 2004; Kaiser et al. 2011; Codron et al. 2019) .",

Adaptations for browsing typically alter the anterior jaw and are primarily associated with the prehension of plant material. Because edible leaves tend to occur as spatially variable clusters (Demment and van Soest 1985; Sanson 2006) , browsers have muzzle characteristics adapted for selective cropping whereas foraging, such as a tall, narrow premaxilla on the cranium Moelleken 1993a, 1993b; Spencer 1995; MacFadden and Shockey 1997; Mendoza and Palmqvist 2006) . In the anterior mandible, browsing adaptations include a relatively narrow symphysis, a relatively round incisor arcade, and central incisors that are large relative to lateral incisors (Owen-Smith 1985; Gordon and Illius 1988; Janis and Ehrhardt 1988; Solounias and Moelleken 1993a; Janis 1995; Fraser and Theodor 2011a) .",

Grasses occur in greater density than leaves and fruits and can be taken in larger amounts per bite (Solounias and Dawson-Saunders 1988) . Grazers generally have wider and flatter muzzles, with wider and more protruding incisors, than browsers (Janis and Ehrhardt 1988; P\u00e9rez-Barber\u00eda and Gordon 2001) . Other dental, as well as muscular adaptations to diet, are also commonly recognized. Grasses are more abrasive than broad-leaf vegetation and are generally consumed in large quantities. Chewing tougher food material requires higher wear resistance of the teeth and a greater amount of occlusal pressure applied to the plant material during mastication. Grazing taxa have significantly higher dental wear rates than browsing taxa (Solounias et al. 1994) . As a result, grazers generally have hypsodont (high-crowned) cheek teeth, whereas browsers have brachydont (low-crowned) cheek teeth (Janis 1988) . Hypsodonty is particularly associated with the second and third molars, resulting in a deeper mandibular body under those teeth. Taller teeth also bring occlusal surfaces closer to the condyle, which serves as the fulcrum of the chewing muscular apparatus (Solounias and Dawson-Saunders 1988; P\u00e9rez-Barber\u00eda and Gordon 1999) . Hypsodonty, however, does not always signify increased grass consumption; high wear resistance is also an adaptation for consuming more dust and grit in the diet (Janis 1988; MacFadden et al. 1999; Solounias and Semprebon 2002; Str\u00f6 mberg 2002; Damuth and Janis 2011) . Grazing ruminants generally have reduced premolar lengths compared with molar lengths and a more elongated diastema than browsing species (Solounias and Dawson-Saunders 1988; Janis 1990; Spencer 1995; Lazagabaster et al. 2016) . Grazers also have larger masseter muscles than browsers (Clauss et al. 2008) . The larger area of attachment for the masseter profundus creates a fuller (less concave) outline on the posterior margin of the mandibular ramus, whereas the large masseter superficialis attachment fills out the ventral margin of the angular (Solounias and Dawson-Saunders 1988) .",

Dietary data from Gagnon and Chew (2000) confirm this general pattern in African bovids. Enamel morphology and tooth-wear also distinguish patterns in frugivorous ruminants that differ from those in other feeding categories (Heywood 2010; Louys et al. 2011; Scott 2012; Gailer and Kaiser 2014; DeSantis 2016) , suggesting that frugivores should be considered as a distinct dietary group in ecomorphological analyses. Indeed, fruits likely differ from leafy vegetation and grasses in terms of physical, chemical, and biological properties. Lumping frugivore and other browsers into 1 broad feeding category in ecomorphological studies may obscure patterns that are potentially important.",

Using landmarkbased geometric morphometrics, we address 2 questions: (1) Can browsers, mixed feeders, and grazers be distinguished in the morphospace of their mandibles? (2) Does a finer dietary classification scheme provide greater accuracy in differentiating diets? Our expectations are that browsers and grazers will be more readily differentiated from each other than from mixed feeders and that a finer classification will allow for certain groups, such as frugivores, to be better differentiated.

The first scheme includes 3 feeding categories that are commonly used in the literature: browsers, mixed feeders, and grazers. The second includes 6 feeding categories identified by Gagnon and Chew (2000) based on proportional consumption of fruits, dicots, and monocots: frugivores, browsers, browser-grazer intermediates, generalists, variable grazers, and obligate grazers (Table 2) . Browsers in the first classification correspond to browsers and frugivores in the second classification; mixed feeders correspond to browser-grazer intermediates and generalists; and grazers correspond to variable grazers and obligate grazers. Although other detailed dietary classifications have been useful in previous studies (e.g., Janis and Ehrhardt 1988; Sponheimer et al. 1999 ; Supplementary Table S1 ), we chose this classification because its quantitative criteria make it readily applicable to a wide range of species. Gagnon and Chew (2000) studied 78 African bovid species, 63 of which are included in our sample. Based on more recent dietary data in the literature, we reclassified 8 of these species to a different feeding category. We also collated dietary information for 37 additional species and assigned each to a feeding category following the criteria derived from Gagnon and Chew's (2000) analysis (Table 2) . These assignments were based on a combination of quantitative data from primary dietary studies, review papers that summarized primary data from various locations, and estimates of percent consumptions used in previous ecological or ecomorphological ( Supplementary Table S2 ). When quantitative information was lacking for a species and estimates were also difficult from existing qualitative descriptions of dietary habits, we assigned species into feeding groups based on qualitative descriptions. Because most species exhibit seasonal and geographic dietary variation, tracking the availability of plant material in their environment, we calculated the average percentages of each food type consumed by each species. Therefore, we note that the spatiotemporally averaged data reflect the general position of species on the dietary spectrum but do not fully capture the breadth of their dietary niche or plasticity in their dietary habits.",

This analysis allows for visualization of shape variation in phylogenetic context. To determine whether the shape is predicted by diet, we conducted a Phylogenetic Generalized Least Square (Procrustes PGLS) analyses using the procD.pgls function in geomorph. Because our goal is to test the applicability of our results to paleontological studies of bovids, in which the exact phylogenetic placements of species are often not known a priori (and are often dependent, at least in part, on craniodental morphology, which would result in circular reasoning), we also conducted a Procrustes Analysis of Variance (Procrustes ANOVA), which does not account for phylogeny, using the procD.lm function in geomorph. We then conducted pairwise comparisons among the means of each feeding category to determine which categories can be distinguished statistically, using the pairwise function in the R package RRPP (Collyer and Adams 2019) . Because of the large number of pairwise comparisons, we used Holm's (1979) method to maintain a table-wide error rate of 5%. The magnitude of morphological differences was quantified by the Procrustes distance between group-mean shapes, also using the pairwise function in RRPP. All statistical analyses were performed using both dietary classifications. The shape variations between dietary groups are visualized as deformations. Because body size affects how morphology performs ecological functions, and ruminant body size correlates with digestive physiology and diet (e.g., Jarman, 1974) , we tested for the effect of allometry using a PGLS analysis and generated box plots to compare ln-transformed centroid sizes (LCSs) values among dietary groups.",

This involves conducting a PCA of the mean shapes of dietary groups, then projecting the data from all species onto those principal components. Unlike a canonical variates analysis, this method does not assume a homogeneous covariance matrix or require inverting it, so a bgPCA can be computed even when the data are not full rank (Mitteroecker and Bookstein 2011) . Even bgPCA can result in spurious separation between groups when the sample size is small relative to the number of variables (Bookstein 2019; Cardini et al. 2019) , although covariances among the variables reduces that effect, and semilandmarks are highly correlated with each other (Cardini et al. 2019 ). However, cross-validation largely solves the issue of spurious separation, and the results will be largely consistent with distance-based permutation tests of statistical significance of the difference between means in the full data space (Cardini and Polly 2020) . To evaluate the performance of this classification function, we performed a jackknife (leave-one-out) cross-validation of the shape data, using the groupPCA function in the R package Morpho (Schlager 2017) , which provided estimates of classification accuracies and misclassification rates.",

PC1 and PC2 explain 45.59% and 14.70% of the shape variance, respectively. Browsers generally plot at the higher ends of PC1 and PC2 compared with grazers, with a relatively small overlap ( Figure 3A ). Mixed feeders overlap extensively with both browsers and grazers in this plane, with little range of distinct morphospace. The total range of mixed feeders is stretched out considerably by Bubalus depressicornis and Bubalus mindorensis, leaving much space unoccupied by mixed feeders in between. These 2 bovines are the only insular species in our dataset, occurring on islands of Southeast Asia. Grouping species with the 6-category classification reveals more about the relationship among dietary groups ( Figure 3B ). Frugivores are well separated from other feeding categories along PC1 and occupy a distinct region of morphospace unoccupied by any other category. Obligate grazers, representing the opposite end of the dietary spectrum, overlap considerably with variable grazers but are separated from browsers and generalists along PC2. Browsers, browsergrazer intermediates, and variable grazers occupy the largest area of morphospace, in part due to the larger number of species in these groups (Table 2) , with overlapping relationships similar to those in the first classification ( Figure 3A ). Generalists are represented by only 5 species in our dataset and cluster near the center of the plot ( Figure 3B ).",

This result is unsurprising because all frugivores sampled in our study belong to this tribe ( Figure 2 ). However, it is notable that the only browsing duiker, Sylvicapra grimmia, diverges markedly from its closest extant relatives and converges with other browsers. Other than frugivores, all dietary groups have common ancestors tracing back to the root of the tree (Figure 2 ). Most obligate grazers belong in tribes Reduncini, Alcelaphini, and Hippotragini. Syncerus caffer is the only obligate grazer in tribe Bovini and, interestingly, its morphological convergence with other obligate grazers notably stretches the tribe's range of morphospace, which would otherwise not overlap with that of Reduncini ( Figure 3C ). Variable grazers are common in the Caprini. The only grazer in Tragelaphini Tragelaphus spekii diverges markedly from its browsing sister taxa and converges with Bovini and Reduncini, which are grazers. These examples suggest that, although dietary habits exhibit a certain amount of phylogenetic clustering (Figure 2 ), mandibular morphology reflects dietary adaptations.",

Variation along the PC2 axis primarily concerns the shape of the angular and coronoid processes ( Figure 3E ). From lower to higher values along PC2: (1) the angular process becomes prominently reduced in size, (2) the coronoid process bends posteriorly and ventrally, accommodated by a more ventrally positioned mandibular condyle, and (3) the cheek-tooth row lengthens despite no elongation of the mandible in general, accommodated by slight shortening of the diastema and the symphysis. Differences in the shape of the coronoid and angular process, as well as in relative tooth lengths, are captured in both principal components.

The effect of the 6-category classification of diet on shape has a greater standardized effect-size (Z \u00bc 4.3) than the 3-category classification (Z \u00bc 3.5), which measures the strength of the relationship between variables. Deformation plots illustrate the differences in mean shapes among the feeding categories (Figure 4 ). Using the first classification, grazers have a shorter cheek-tooth row, a deeper mandibular corpus, a shorter diastema and symphysis, a taller coronoid process, and a more dorsally and posteriorly positioned condyle than browsers ( Figure 4A ). Comparing species using the second classification scheme reveals more details about shape variation among dietary groups. Differences found between browsers and grazers in the first classification are magnified in the second classification when comparing the mean shape of frugivores with that of variable grazers ( Figure 4B ) and, to a lesser extent, with that of obligate grazers ( Figure 4C ). Notable variations exist between frugivores and other browsers, which are often grouped as 1 category, with frugivores having a longer anterior mandible, a deeper mandibular corpus, a larger angular process, and a shorter coronoid process ( Figure 4D ). Comparing the 2 grazers in the second classification scheme, obligate grazers have shorter a molar row, a longer diastema, a slightly larger angular, and a slightly anteriorly and dorsally oriented coronoid process than variable grazers ( Figure 4E ). In addition to differences in tooth-crown height and coronoid process, obligate grazers also have a larger angular process than nonfrugivorous browsers ( Figure 4F) . No significant allometric effect was detected (P \u00bc 0.091) ( Table 3) . Although diet does not have a significant impact on size (P > 0.16), LCS of mandibles do show differences among the dietary groups, with the smallest mean LCS value found in frugivores and the largest in obligate grazers ( Figure  5 ).",

Browsers and grazers are both more frequently misclassified as mixed feeders (30.3% and 16.7% of the time, respectively) than with each other (<7%). Mixed feeders are misclassified as browsers and grazers at equal rates (16.7%). For the more detailed classification scheme, the classification accuracy averaged across all 6 feeding categories is 67.4%, similar to that of the first classification scheme.

Notably, frugivores are never misclassified as another dietary group, and species in other groups were rarely misclassified as frugivores. Variable grazers have the next highest classification accuracy (67.9%) but can be misclassified as browsergrazer intermediates and generalists and, less frequently, as obligate grazers.

Using a 6-category dietary classification, our results show that frugivores and obligate grazers, which represent end members of the frugivore-browser-grazer spectrum proposed by Bodmer (1990) , can be identified accurately with mandibular morphology alone ( Figure 3B and Tables 3-5). The finer classification also reveals subtle differences within browsing species (i.e., frugivore versus browser; Figure 4D ) and within grazing species (i.e., variable grazer versus obligate grazer; Figure 4E ). Distinguishing mixed feeders from browsers and grazers has traditionally been difficult (Janis 1995) . Browser-grazer intermediates and generalists in our data are not well differentiated from each other or from most other dietary groups ( Figure 3B and Tables 4B and 5B). These groups by definition have broad, unspecialized dietary habits, and this is unsurprisingly reflected by their mandibular morphology. Although dietary extremes are more clustered in the bovid phylogeny than other feeding categories are (Figure 2 ), which could have contributed to their distinctive shapes, the association of shape with dietary differentiation renders mandibular shape a potentially useful paleodietary proxy, regardless of the mechanism that creates the association. Our geometric morphometrics analysis identified variations in mandibular shape among dietary groups, including relative diastema length, relative cheek-tooth length and height, and relative size of muscle insertion areas (Figures 3 and 4) . In the context of existing knowledge about ungulate ecology and functional morphology, our findings have implications for bovid ecology and raise questions that invite further research, discussed below.",

These differences suggest that consumption of fruits requires greater bite forces than of leafy material. Certain fruit tissues (e.g., large seed shells) have been considered as the most common hard-food objects eaten by mammals (Lucas et al. 2008) . For example, tayassuid species that feed on palm fruits, which are tougher than other food materials they consume, have more biomechanically powerful skulls (Hendges et al. 2019) . For bovids, studies have shown that frugivores are more similar to grazers than to browsers in the inter-tooth variation of enamel indentation, and they possess thickened enamel and large occlusal surface areas relative to body size (Heywood 2010; Gailer and Kaiser 2014). Higher biomechanical demands for hard-object feeding are considered to be a primary driver of occlusal dental morphology in bovids. Extant frugivorous bovids consume fruits from dozens of plant species but preferentially feed on those with small seeds (Gautier-Hion et al. 1985; Hofmann and Roth 2003) . However, little is known about the material properties of the specific fruits consumed by bovids or the biomechanical demand of frugivory in relation to body size. Our results call for more research on these topics. Previous work on ruminant muzzle shape revealed that browsers have a longer diastema and a narrower symphysis than grazers, which is related to selectivity of feeding, the ability to discriminate and procure high-quality food from surrounding foliage (e.g., Fraser and Theodor 2011a). Our shape data show that 1 notable difference between frugivores and other feeding groups (including browsers) is the elongation of the mandible anterior to the cheek teeth, including elongation of the symphysis, in frugivores. This difference implies even higher selectivity in the frugivore diet (i.e., fruits) than in the browser diet (i.e., leaves and stems).",

Browsing is the most common dietary guild among ungulate species, occurring in open grassland, arid habitats, and tropical rainforests. The wide distribution of browsers reflects the presence of dicotyledonous plants in a vast array of habitats. Resource partitioning among co-occurring species can occur in at least 3 ways: choice of primary food, habitat preference, and feeding-height preference (Jarman and Sinclair 1979; Janis 1995; Spencer 1995; Mendoza et al. 2002) . Our dietary classification reflects the first way, and further division of this dietary group may be possible. Our results highlight the high disparity and diversity within browsing bovids (and ungulates in general), which have likely been understudied in ecomorphological and ecometric analyses using broad-brush dietary classifications.",

                "text": "Some dental and mandibular adaptions in grazers have been well studied. Specifically, hypsodont molars provide grazers with more materials for wear, and larger masseter muscles provide greater bite force for consuming monocotyledonous plants (e.g., Mendoza et al. 2002; Damuth and Janis 2011) . We were able to detect these features in our data with the depth of the mandibular corpus and the size of the angular process, respectively. Two other morphological characteristics of grazer mandibles evident in our results deserve further attention. The first characteristic is a taller, more posteriorly oriented coronoid process compared with browsers and frugivores ( Figures 3D and 4) . The coronoid process serves as the effective moment arm of the temporalis muscle, and a longer coronoid process allows the muscle to generate greater bite force with the same torque (Kiltie 1982; P\u00e9rez-Barber\u00eda and Gordon 1999; Hendges et al. 2019) . Omnivorous ungulates (pigs and peccaries) have a shorter coronoid process than herbivorous ungulates, reflecting their less tough diet (P\u00e9rez-Barber\u00eda and Gordon 1999). These authors, however, found no difference in coronoid height between browsing and grazing species. Our results suggest that grazing bovids have temporalis muscles that generate greater bite force to meet the needs of a tougher diet. The second characteristic is a relatively short premolar row in grazers. Some extinct and living species (e.g., Teleoceras spp., Connochaetes spp.) have lost the second premolar (p2) over evolutionary time, and these species are generally considered grazers. Many other grazing species, whereas having maintained 3 premolars, have reduced premolar row lengths relative to mandible size (Figure 3 ). Solounias and Dawson-Saunders (1988) speculated that reduced premolar lengths in grazing ruminants resulted from a more posterior chewing position, bringing the food closer to the fulcrum of the chewing musculature. Other authors have attributed reduced premolars to the facilitation of larger bite sizes (e.g., Codron et al. 2008 ). These explanations have not been rigorously tested or applied to inferring grazing adaptions in extinct species. A finite element analysis may be able to address this question (e.g., Fletcher et al. 2010; Zhou et al. 2019) . It is worth noting that reduction of the premolar row is not always correlated with percent grass consumption in ungulate groups (Codron et al. 2019) . In perissodactyls, there is in fact an opposite trend for a more pronounced premolar row (through molarization of the premolars) in grazing perissodactyls compared with browsing ones (Janis 1990; Mendoza et al. 2002) . Consequently, the total occlusal surface area (and the total occlusal volume) in grazing perissodactyls (e.g., horses) is larger than that of ruminants of similar diet (Janis 1988) .",

                "text": "The study by Forrest et al. (2018) is the only 1 prior to ours that uses geometric morphometrics to study bovid mandibles in relation to diet. Based on 3D shape data of 35 extant species, their analyses yielded cross-validated accuracy rates of 80-97% (for individual specimens), higher than those in the present study (for species). Other than differences in sampled specimens and statistical methods, several factors may explain the difference in results. First, 3D data capture variation in the transverse plane and frontal plane, including width of the symphysis (narrower in browsers) and lateral position of the coronoid process (more distally positioned in browsers). Second, different feeding categories can yield different results. Their classification scheme included grazing, fresh-grass grazing, mixed feeding-preferring grass, mixed feeding-preferring browse, and browsing ( Supplementary Table S1 ), which may be more useful for differentiating diet, although it may not be readily applicable to species beyond their study due to its qualitative nature. Third, different taxonomic coverages capture different amounts of evolutionary and ecological information, which affects shape analysis. As shown by Solounias and Dawson-Saunders (1988) , species classified in the same dietary group can have a mosaic of craniodental features. Asynchronous evolution of dietary habits and morphology, evolutionary reversal of feeding habits, independent evolution of morphology in the same environment could also result in similar but variable forms that perform the same ecological function (Solounias and Dawson-Saunders 1988) . Therefore, the wider taxonomic range covered in our study inherits more confounding factors that can complicate the significance of the functional signal. All these factors and associated uncertainties are important to consider in paleoecological reconstructions.",

How exactly to categorize diet should be, of course, tailored to the specific research goals of each ecomorphological study. However, based on findings of our comparative analyses, we recommend at least 4 dietary groups for ruminants: frugivores, browsers, mixed feeders, and grazers. Further divisions in browsers and in grazers could also reveal interesting patterns.",

                "text": "Combining evidence from this and previous studies, we here propose a conceptual model of the relative dietary mechanical demand and cropping selectivity along the frugivore-browser-grazer spectrum ( Figure 6 ). In general, ruminants with small body sizes feed on higher-quality fruit and browse diets, which are often surrounded by lower-quality plant materials, whereas larger-bodied ruminants feed on browse and grass diets (Jarman 1974; Langer 1986) . Comparison of mandible sizes and morphologies among dietary groups is consistent with this pattern (Figures 4 and 5) . In frugivores, dental and angular morphologies indicate capability of consuming tough plants or plant parts, and anterior mandible morphologies and small body sizes suggest more selective cropping. In grazers, inferred hypsodonty (from mandibular depth), angular and coronoid morphologies, and potentially premolar length indicate capability of consuming tough plants, and their incisor morphology and large body size suggest low selectivity of forage. Details of this model require verification and refinement through further investigation. We note that \"mechanical demand\" here broadly summarizes all mechanical resistance that teeth and muscles experience during the acquisition and processing of forage, which can result from the hardness of the food material itself, shear from anterior-posterior movements of the jaw, and shear from lateral movements of the jaw. Specifically, we need better understanding of (1) the material property of the fruits that frugivorous bovids consume, especially in relation to body size, (2) the feeding behavior and evolutionary history regarding fallback foods in frugivores, (3) the mastication mechanisms of frugivores and grazers, and (4) the range of feeding habits of non-frugivorous browsers and mixed feeders.",
