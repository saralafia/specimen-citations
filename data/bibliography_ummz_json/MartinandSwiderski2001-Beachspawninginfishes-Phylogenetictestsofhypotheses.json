Many marine organisms spawn intertidally, but very few take advantage of the highest tides to deposit eggs in areas that may otherwise be inaccessible to swimming organisms. Beach spawning as we define it requires a marine environment with tides, allowing regular advance and retreat of the water line. Because the ocean's margins move up and down the shore with tidal height, animals that spawn around the highest tides place their eggs higher on shore than animals that spawn intertidally at other times. The highest high tides, called the semilunar tides, occur twice a month around the times of the full and new moon.",

All spawning takes place within a couple of hours after the semilunar high tides, on a few nights during the spring and summer months (Walker, 1952) . More remarkably, fish actually emerge from the ocean, riding high waves onto shore to spawn on the sandy beaches. Females dig into the soft sand tail first to release their eggs, while males on the surface curl around them to fertilize the eggs. Then, on a subsequent large wave, the fish wash back into the ocean. The eggs remain terrestrial, buried in the damp sand above the tide mark, until the subsequent high semilunar tides, approximately two weeks later (Darken et al., 1998) . At that time the fully developed eggs are washed free from the sand by high waves, and the larvae hatch out (Griem and Martin, 2000) . A congener in the Gulf of California, L. sardina, also spawns out of the water at high tides and buries its eggs in sand above the tide mark (Thomson and Muench, 1976) .",

Eggs in the middle intertidal zone may be emerged for a few hours a month during extremely low tides, but eggs spawned on the beach, in the highest intertidal zone, may be emerged on a daily or constant basis (Walker, 1952; Taylor et al., 1977; Leggett and Frank, 1990) . Surprisingly, brief aerial emergence during low tides does not seem to be a serious problem for fish eggs, as long as they are kept moist (Marliave, 1981; DeMartini, 1999) . Risk of desiccation during emergence of eggs is attenuated by depositing them on a substrate that will retain moisture, such as sea grasses, or by burying the eggs in sand or gravel (Middaugh et al., 1983) .",

Risks of terrestrial hatching of aquatic larvae could be reduced by tidal synchrony of embryonic development in tandem with the spawning activities during semilunar high tides, or with delayed hatching and extended incubation of eggs, using an environmental trigger to initiate hatching under appropriate conditions (Martin, 1999) .

Some of the benefits could be obtained without terrestrial exposure of eggs. Spawning in shallow water of tidal basins, or attachment of eggs to subtidal substrates such as plants, in areas with high current could provide the eggs with high oxygen levels without the risk of desiccation. However, in some environments, subtidal deposition of eggs may lead to unacceptably high mortality and beach spawning may be the only way that fishes can be permanent residents of these habitats (Taylor and DiMichele, 1983; Tewksbury and Conover, 1987) . The comparative method suggests examining other species with similar spawning habits. By examining the other species of fishes that also spawn on beaches in the high intertidal zone, we have a basis for formulating hypotheses about the sequence of events in evolution of this reproductive behavior. However, other information is needed to test these hypotheses.",

By mapping aspects of spawning behavior onto a phylogeny inferred from other traits, we can examine the relationships among changes in different aspects of spawning behavior, their relationship to changes in physiology and other behaviors, and also the relationship between changes in spawning behavior and the divergence of taxa. For example, a trait which is wide-spread in a clade that includes beach spawners and their relatives would not only be inferred to be primitive for the entire clade, it may also be judged irrelevant to eventual evolution of beach spawning because few of the descendants achieved that more derived state. This conclusion would be further strengthened by finding that other clades with beach spawners did not have the supposed precursor state. Support for the hypothesis that a particular state is an important or even necessary intermediate step would come from finding that state only in the closest relatives of the beach spawners, particularly if the trait arises convergently in many widely separated lineages. The argument could be bolstered by experimental studies showing the intermediate state confers a selective advantage that increases with the height that fish spawn in the intertidal zone.",

These features may not be precursors, but adaptations for beach spawning that evolved afterward. Additional information would be needed before making this interpretation because the phylogenetic analysis cannot determine which trait is the precursor, and therefore cannot determine which is an adaptation for the other when both traits occur in exactly the same set of taxa. Another possibility is that no features exhibit a consistent relationship to beach spawning. In other words, the phylogenetic analysis may reveal that beach spawning arose under wholly unique circumstances in each clade. If this is the case, then beach spawning may have evolved for different adaptive reasons in each clade. An example of this situation would be the case in which distantly related taxa converge on beach spawning through different sequences of transformation. Thus, not only does phylogenetic analysis allow reconstruction of the intermediate steps taken in the evolution of a complex behavior; it also provides the opportunity to distinguish detailed convergence from superficial similarity. Together, these possibilities make phylogenetic analysis a powerful tool for understanding the evolution of complex behaviors.",

Thus any attempt to infer patterns of character evolution from published phylogenies must take into account the limitations of the methods that were used to generate the trees, the degree of resolution and the robustness of the resolved branches, and the completeness of taxon sampling. In addition, users of published trees should be aware of controversies or conflicting interpretations of the relationships of the species of interest. However, the most important point to bear in mind is that any phylogeny is a hypothesis that is subject to revision if additional data become available. Consequently, any interpretation of character evolution that is based on a phylogeny is a hypothesis that can be rejected in two ways: by discovery of contradictory evidence concerning the characters of interest, and by revision of the phylogeny to a form that requires reinterpretation of those characters. Nevertheless, we are optimistic that our analyses, based on the systematic work summarized below, will help to direct future study of these groups and narrow the range of plausible hypotheses to test.",

Their eggs are deposited on vegetation or in empty seashells, so they are protected from desiccation during frequent air emergence throughout the time of incubation. Eggs are ready to hatch in nine to twelve days, but delay hatching if emerged, until submerged by a semilunar high tide (DiMichele and Taylor, 1981) . The tidal bore of water in a salt marsh estuary typically involves very little wave action, with slow and steady increases and decreases in water level. Thus spawning mummichogs are not cast on shore by waves during spawning. In at least one estuarine site, Menidia menidia and Fundulus heteroclitus both spawn on sea grasses in the high intertidal zone (Conover and Kynard, 1984) .

When fish are as high on the beach as the wave can carry them, they quickly hollow out an area of fine gravel and deposit their spawn. On the next high wave they return to water. Along with the grunion, these are the only marine fish known to fully emerge from water solely for the purpose of spawning. Capelin from the same populations also spawn lower in the intertidal zone and subtidally, 70 to 80 m deep.

Occasionally these fish flip up out of the water (Lamb and Edgell, 1986) . The eggs develop optimally in the mid-intertidal zone; survival decreases in eggs placed too high or too low (Loosanoff, 1937) . Thompson et al.

Depending on temperature, eggs hatch in 8 to 90 days (Love, 1996) . Spawning occurs throughout much of the year, only in the daytime and particularly during diurnal high tides of the late afternoon, thus this species is also called the day smelt (Hart, 1973) .

Crabtree did include two species of the subfamily Menidiinae, Labidesthes sicculus and Menidia beryllina, which were used as outgroups to root the tree. Distance Wagner analysis of modified Roger's genetic distances, and parsimony analysis of coded allozyme character states produced somewhat different results.

Their phylogeny differs from all previous phylogenies for this group, largely because they corrected several errors made in earlier studies (see critical reviews in Johnson and Patterson [1996] and Patterson and Johnson [1997] ). The phylogeny produced by Johnson and Patterson is quite robust; it is based on 112 anatomical characters and every node is supported by at least three uncontroverted synapomorphies.

The logic is that anadromous runs incorporate synchronized, seasonal spawning in a habitat different from the usual adult habitat (McDowall, 1988) . Spawning migrations from marine to fresh water, or from fresh water to the oceans, are present in only about 0.6% of all species of fishes, but are much more common in osmerids and their relatives (McDowall, 1993) . Anadromy is present in the majority of osmerids and salangids (the sister group of Mallotus), and it is also present in most members of the sister group of this clade. This distribution supports McDowall's (1993) inference that anadromy is primitive for osmerids. Because the beach spawning osmerids are not closely related to each other ( Fig. 2) , we infer that each instance represents an independent modification of anadromy.",

In this hypothesis, the spawning site moves gradually from deeper to shallower water. In the most primitive state, spawning occurs in the subtidal zone where water levels rise and fall, but the substrate is never exposed directly to the air. In progressively more derived states, spawning occurs progressively higher in the intertidal zone where the substrate is exposed for progressively greater amounts of time.

However, the plausibility of this story does not make it true. For example, the anadromous osmerids typically spawn in shallow water. It seems reasonable, therefore, that their nonanadromous relatives would also spawn in shallow water and evolve to spawn progressively higher in the intertidal zone. In fact, our phylogenetic analysis provides little support for this hypothesis (Fig. 2) . There are three species that spawn high in the intertidal zone. All of them are most closely related to anadromous species, not to species that spawn lower in the tidal zone. The one other non-anadromous species in our analysis, A. elongatus, spawns in the subtidal zone, far from the beach. In this group, the only support for the hypothesis that beach spawners evolved from ancestors that spawn lower in the intertidal zone comes from the capelin, M. villosus. Members of this species spawn in a wide variety of locations, ranging from the high intertidal zone (Leggett and Frank, 1990) to subtidal waters 80 m deep (Frank and Leggett, 1981) . This example may indicate that it is possible to pass rapidly through the entire sequence, which would explain the lack of extant intermediates. But even here, to demonstrate an evolutionary sequence into increasingly shallow spawning sites, it is necessary to perform an analysis of the genealogical relationships among capelin populations that spawn in different locations.",

In fact the distribution of freshwater and marine species (Fig. 3) , together with the poor resolution of the phylogeny, makes it impossible to tell whether freshwater or marine habitats are primitive.

Here, the focus is on whether a particular trait arose prior to spawning on beaches, and if so, how many other taxa that share the trait did subsequently evolve to spawn on beaches. If the traits are prerequisites for beach spawning, the same traits should be found in closely related species, particularly if those taxa spawn in environments that have features in common with the high intertidal zone. On the other hand, if the traits in question are found in all or most of the taxa within the clade, the trait may be so primitive that its evolution has no bearing on the evolution of beach spawning.",

All of these taxa produce eggs that are negatively buoyant (demersal), and most produce eggs that adhere to the substrate on which they are spawned. Intuitively, these traits seem to confer a distinct advantage over eggs that lack these traits, because negative bouyancy and adhesiveness both prevent eggs spawned in these high energy environments from being swept too far up the beach or out into deeper water. In fact, vertical height of placement within the intertidal zone is known to strongly affect egg survival in surf smelt (Loosanoff, 1937) , Atlantic silversides (Middaugh et al., 1983) , and puffers (Yamahira, 1996 (Yamahira, , 2001 ). However, these traits are likely to be advantageous to any fish that selects a particular environment or substrate for spawning. For example, herring eggs spawned on intertidal seagrasses survive better than those placed lower, perhaps as a result of greater oxygen availability and increased temperature (Jones, 1972) . Thus it is no surprise that almost all of the osmerids and atherinopsids for which we have data produce eggs that are both demersal and adherent. The sole exception appears to be the grunion, which produce nonadhesive demersal eggs. Grunion bury their eggs in the substrate, which removes the need for adhesion. Unfortunately, this unique coincidence of burial and the lack of adhesion does not allow discrimination between the hypothesis that adhesion was lost after the evolution of burial made it irrelevant, and the hypothesis that the loss of adhesion preceded and even precipitated the evolution of burial. The risks encountered by exposure in the high intertidal zone may seem to indicate that evolution of egg burial preceded the loss of adhesion, but the hypothesis that evolution of burial preceded both the loss of adhesion and spawning high in the intertidal zone cannot be ruled out by the available data.",

Survival of eggs spawned on beaches appears to require substrates that provide a delicate balance of moisture that prevents desiccation and permeability that permits gas diffusion. Inorganic sediments may retain less water than plant material that mats, but matting may restrict gas exchange. Consequently, fish that bury their eggs in sediments probably must place their eggs higher in the intertidal zone, for better drainage and oxygen availability, than fish that oviposit onto vegetation. Conversely, fish that deposit eggs on vegetation may be forced to spawn lower in the intertidal zone where the plants are periodically separated by the rising water. A similar set of tradeoffs may explain why surf smelt, which spawn in fine gravel, can spawn successfully lower in the intertidal zone than grunion, spawning in sand. Coarse sediments retain less water and permit more gas exchange than fine sediment. Although a few studies have shown that the spawning substrates can influence egg survival (cf., Middaugh et al., 1983; Yamahira, 2001) , further studies are needed to determine the physiological tolerances of the eggs. Only then will it be possible to test hypotheses about the relationship between egg physiology and spawning behavior.",

Benthic substrates in the intertidal zone are determined by a number of factors including proximity to a sediment source such as a river, mean wave height, and the slope of the beach. One consequence of the interaction of these factors is that the characteristics of the substrate tend to vary as a function of tidal height. As a result, fishes that spawn in association with a particular substrate are likely to find an appropriate substrate only in particular subtidal or intertidal zones. For such a fish to begin spawning in the highest intertidal zone, it would have to evolve a new preference for spawning substrate that is only ephemerally available when it is under water or washed by waves during semilunar high tides. A more plausible hypothesis is that a fish with less rigid substrate preferences could take advantage of high intertidal spawning sites when they are available, and spawn in alternative locations when the high intertidal sites are not available.",

(1981) and Conover and Kynard (1984) have suggested the distribution of sea grasses in the highest intertidal zone imposes a semilunar rhythm on the spawning of Menidia menidia. These fish spawn more frequently and asynchronously when spawning substrates are readily present in the laboratory (Conover and Kynard, 1984) . The burial of eggs in coarse sand almost certainly requires semilunar timing for the grunion as well (Walker, 1952; Thomson and Muench, 1976) . Grunion eggs are deposited in sand at a tidal height that permits terrestrial incubation (Walker, 1952; Thomson and Muench, 1976) . If these eggs are buried in sand underwater, diffusion of oxygen is insufficient to support life and the eggs perish (Griem and Martin, 2000) . Spawning in sand may require fish to place eggs higher on the beach than spawning in fine gravel (Thomson and Muench, 1976) , because the size of the interstitial spaces affects the flow of water and diffusion of oxygen around the eggs, particularly when they are submerged (Strathmann and Hess, 1999) . Interestingly, Atherinopsis californiensis, the sister group of grunion, is more flexible than grunion in its choice of spawning substrates. This may be evidence that grunion's beach spawning and synchrony with the tidal cycle arose as a result of restriction of spawning site preferences, but more data on atherinopsid spawning behavior are needed to determine whether A. californiensis exhibits the more primitive behavior.",

Furthermore, the available data indicate that most osmerids spawn on multiple substrates. It may still be the case that flexibility in substrate selection permitted the evolution of beach spawning, but there is no evidence of a subsequent restriction of preferences. Instead, this appears to be one more bit of evidence indicating that beach spawning arose by several different transformation series.",

Puffer fish broadcast spawn their eggs across cobble beaches high in the intertidal zone, and the eggs roll around in the wave wash (Yamahira, 1996) . Populations of puffers spawn at different tidal heights and times, according to the substrate on their spawning beaches (Yamahira, 2001) . White sticklebacks in Nova Scotia spawn intertidally on bare rock, and males scatter the eggs about, then do not provide any further parental care. Survival of eggs and embryos is surprisingly high (MacDonald et al., 1995) .",

Beach spawning also has evolved independently in several additional teleost clades, including the Fundulidae (Taylor, 1990) , the Tetraodontidae (Yamahira, 1996) , the Gasterosteidae (MacDonald et al., 1995) , and the Galaxiidae (McDowall, 1988) . In each case, the move onto the beach for oviposition represents entry into a novel habitat. Second, beach spawning runs have evolved repeatedly from anadromous spawning runs in the Osmeridae and the Gasterosteidae (MacDonald et al., 1995) , but not in the Atherinopsidae nor in most other clades containing beach spawning fish. Third, beach spawning has not evolved from a gradual vertical migration of spawning sites up the shoreline for either clade examined here. Close relatives of beach spawning fishes do not show any gradient of spawning site with tidal height. Some beach spawners appear to choose a particular substrate for their oviposition, and opportunistically move into the habitats that provide that substrate, but others take advantage of multiple spawning sites and substrates in the field. The latter group includes Atlantic silversides, M. menidia (Middaugh, 1981) , capelin Mallotus villosus (Frank and Leggett, 1981) and the mummichog, F. heteroclitus (Taylor and DiMichele, 1983) .",

It may have been obvious to any well-trained ichthyologist that beach spawning in groups as disparate as puffers, sticklebacks and smelts was the result of convergence, however phylogenetic analysis was instrumental in confirming convergence within atherinopsids (grunion and silversides) and especially within osmerids (smelts and capelin). Phylogenetic analysis was also necessary to rule out hypotheses proposing stepwise sequences of transformation. We found no evidence of such sequences, even though beach spawning has evolved frequently in certain lineages. Rather, beach spawning appears to be the result of several highly plastic traits associated with reproduction (Conover and Kynard, 1984) , a true ''leap of faith'' for each fish species that accomplishes it.",

Second, we have omitted the Salangidae, which Johnson and Patterson infer to be the sister group of Mallotus. We have omitted the salangids because Johnson and Patterson did not resolve the relationships within this group and because none of them are beach spawners.",
