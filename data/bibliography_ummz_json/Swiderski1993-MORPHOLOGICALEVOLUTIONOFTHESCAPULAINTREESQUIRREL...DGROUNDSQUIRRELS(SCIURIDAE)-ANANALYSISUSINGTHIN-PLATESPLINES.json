    "abstract": "The mammalian scapula, like many bones, is a single structural element that serves as an attachment site for several muscles. The goal of this study was to determine whether the scapula evolves as an integrated unit, or as a collection of distinct parts. Shape differences among the scapulae of tree squirrels, chipmunks, and ground squirrels were described using thin-plate spline analysis. This technique produces a geometric description of shape differences that can be decomposed into a series of components ranging in scale from features that span the entire form to features that are highly localized. Shape differences among tree squirrel scapulae were found only in largescale features, indicating spatially integrated shape change. Chipmunks and ground squirrels differ from tree squirrels in several features, but shared differences reflecting divergence of their common ancestor were found only in the small-scale features. Divergence of ground squirrels from the common ancestor involved some large-scale changes but was dominated by small-scale changes. Divergence of chipmunks was dominated by large-scale changes. Thus, the scapula evolved as an integrated unit during some transitions but as a collection of distinct parts during others. These results suggest that evolutionary patterns of the postcranial skeleton may be as complex as the patterns that have been described for skulls and feeding mechanisms.",

Support for both evolutionary models can be found in previous studies of scapular shape differences. Lehman (1963) , Stein (1981) , and Taylor (1974) report that localized enlargement of specific muscle attachment areas distinguish various specialists from related generalists. Oxnard (1968) reports that several orders of mammals exhibit parallel patterns of shape differences that reflect general factors acting on the whole scapula. The goal of my study is to determine which pattern characterizes the evolution of scapular shape in the Sciuridae.",

The distortion caused by projecting all landmarks onto this plane will have greatest effect on the landmarks of the acromion and metacromion, which are separated laterally from the blade. However, the construction of the scapula is fairly simple (two nearly flat surfaces separated by a strut), and many potential effects of changes in lateral position can be easily predicted. Tilting of the spine will produce identical antero-posterior displacements of all landmarks on the acromion and metacromion. Tilting of the acromion and metacromion will appear to produce proportionate narrowing of these structures. Changing the height of the spine will affect the apparent size of the acromion and metacromion relative to the blade. These \"distortions\" must be kept in mind when interpreting shape changes localized to the acromion and metacromion.",

Examination of the scatter plots of the partial warps reveals only two features with similar distributions. Both plots suggest that there may have been a small shape change in the common ancestor of chipmunks and ground squirrels, and that later changes in a different direction separated ground squirrels from the common ancestor and Ictidomys from the other ground squirrels. This is the only evidence of historical coordination of scapular shape changes in sciurids. Leamy and Atchley (1984) and Oxnard (1968) also suggested that scapular shape changes will reflect functional shifts. However, the preceding discussion of scapular shape changes indicates that there are nine historical patterns for 10 shape features. None of these patterns is associated with the evolution of fossoriality. No feature exhibits parallel transformations in chipmunks and ground squirrels that separate the highly fossorial species (Tamias striatus and Ta. minimus; Spermophilus columbianus and Sp. tridecemlineatus) from less fossorial species. These results do not mean that scapular shape is not influenced by function; but the variety of patterns does indicate that no one factor has a strong effect. This is not the first study to show that a seemingly cohesive skeletal structure has not evolved as an integrated unit. Van der Klaauw (1948 Klaauw ( -1952 and Dullemeijer (1958) demonstrated that the skull evolves as though it contains several discrete units, and even the bones that comprise the skull do not always evolve as single elements.",

On W6, the tips of the acromion and metacromion have parallel displacements, whereas landmarks near the acromion-metacromion boundary are displaced in the opposite direction (fig. 7C). On both W7 and W9, the two landmarks at the tip of the acromion have opposite displacements (fig. 7D,E). The two landmarks on the neck and ventral end of the spine also have opposite displacements on these principal warps. W7 and W9 differ in the relationship of displacements at the neck and dorsal edge of the acromion: parallel in W7, opposite in W9. W7 also includes displacement of the landmark representing the acromion-metacromion boundary. Deformations. -Figure 8 presents Cartesian grid deformations (produced by TPSpline) showing scapulae of selected species as transformations of the mean tree squirrel (starting form). Grids for two tree squirrel species (fig. 8A,D) deviate only slightly from straight lines, indicating small deformations of the starting form. Still, the deformed grids show that there are different patterns of deformation; the expansions and compressions of grid lines occur between different sets of landmarks. The two chipmunks (fig. 8B,E) may share some features, but the deformation of Tamias striatus lacks the dramatic tilt of the horizontal lines shown in the deformation of Ta. rufus. The deformations of the two ground squirrels appear to be even more similar, differing primarily in the magnitude of change (fig. 8C,F). These six deformations and those for the other 10 species were decomposed into their affine and partial warp components specifically to identify groups of species that share features of mean scapular shape. Scatter plots of the loadings for each component are examined for gaps between taxonomic groups and for historical patterns reflecting the transition from arboreal to fossorial habits. The affine component makes little contribution to morphological change except in chipmunks (fig. 9). Anisotropy values are quite small for tree squirrels, even the largest tree squirrel anisotropy represents a barely perceptible shape change (fig. 1 OA). The anisotropies of most ground squirrels are only slightly larger, and that of one ground squirrel is well within the tree squirrel range. Directions of affine deformation vary widely in tree squirrels and ground squirrels, and the only species that share a Distribution of affine components of deformation from TPSpline, plotted in polar coordinates: log anisotropy, 20 (following Bookstein 1991). Symbols indicate locations of species means: circle, tree squirrel; triangle, chipmunk; square, ground squirrel. direction are two distantly related ground squirrels, Spermophilus lateralis and Sp. spilosoma. In contrast, only one chipmunk, Ta. striatus, has a small affine transformation that falls within the ground squirrel range. The other chipmunks, representing the subgenus Neotamias, have much larger affine deformations, and all of them are oriented in the antero-dorsal direction. This component of shape change makes a substantial contribution to the distinctness of Neotamias scapulae (fig. 1 OB). The bending component of largest scale, W1, also contributes little to the deformations of most tree squirrel and ground squirrel scapulae (fig. 1 1, W1). Even in Sciurus carolinensis, the tree squirrel with the largest loading for this component, the shape changes are fairly subtle: the central landmarks are displaced dorsally, compressing the dorsal end of the scapula and stretching the ventral end (fig. 1 2A). One ground squirrel, Sp. spilosoma has the opposite transformation. The other ground squirrels have deformations in the same range as tree squirrels. Most chipmunks have relatively large loadings in the -x direction. This pattern primarily represents narrowing of the supraspinous fossa with extension of the acromion (fig. 12B). This component separates most chipmunks from ground squirrels, but one chipmunk, Ta. rufus, is clearly within the ground squirrel range. Also, Ta. striatus is near the center of the Neotamias distribution.",

Although neither group has diverged far from tree squirrels, they have diverged in different directions. Chipmunks have + loadings reflecting dorso-ventral compression of the supraspinous fossa with tilting of the acromion and lower metacromion (fig. 1 3A). Ground squirrels have the opposite transformation, and a particularly large -y loading distinguishes Sp. tridecemlineatus from the others. Chipmunks and ground squirrels both have broad ranges of +x loadings that reflect anteroposterior compression of the dorsal end of the blade (fig. 1 3B). The combination of large x and small y loading on W2 distinguishes Ta. striatus from Neotamias. Thus, changes represented by this warp contribute to diversity of tree squirrels, to divergence of chipmunks and ground squirrels from tree squirrels, and to divergence of chipmunk subgenera. The diversity of loadings for tree squirrels and ground squirrels on W3 is relatively low, comparable to the diversity of their WI loadings (fig. 11, W3). The diversity of chipmunks is even lower, but more importantly, their shared divergence from tree squirrels is readily apparent. All chipmunks, including Ta. striatus, are characterized by dorso-ventral compression of the acromion and ventral metacromion (fig. 14A). In contrast, these structures tend to be expanded along the antero-posterior axis in ground squirrels (fig. 14B), although some ground squirrels retain shapes that are very similar to tree squirrels. An unusual deformation that combines relatively large expansions in both antero-posterior and dorso-ventral directions characterizes Sp. spilosoma and Sp. tridecemlineatus, the two ground squirrels representing the subgenus Ictidomys. The distribution of loadings on W4 suggests that evolution of this feature in chipmunks and ground squirrels extends a linear trend found in tree squirrels (",

Consequently, this feature is clearly evident only in the total deformation of Ta. striatus (fig. 8). Ground squirrels have larger W6 transformations (fig. 1 7B) and relatively less diversity in the larger scale features. Consequently, the deformations of W6 contribute substantially to total deformations of the ground squirrels (fig. 8). The two species with particularly large deformations of W6 are the two members of Ictidomys: Sp. spilosoma and Sp. tridecemlineat us. All species have small loadings on W7 (fig. 11, W7). Even the largest loadings represent trivial morphological changes. Thus, this warp does not represent an important component of shape change in any taxon. All transformations of the ventral end of the scapula are at other scales. Loadings on W8 also span a small range (fig. 11, W8), but there is a tendency for loadings on this warp to differentiate between tree squirrels and terrestrial sciurids. Ground squirrels and chipmunks all share reduction of the teres fossa (fig. 18). However, the teres fossa also is reduced in one of the tree squirrels, so the two groups are not completely separate. The distribution of loadings on the most localized warp (fig. 11, W9) is similar to the dis-tribution of loadings on W6. Diversity within each of the three main groups is small, but gaps between groups are substantial and Ictidomys is distinct from other ground squirrels. In tree squirrels, the transformations of most species are trivial compared with the contributions of other warps. The exception is the transformation in Tamiasciurus hudsonicus, which is similar to that found in chipmunks. This transformation involves tapering and ventral displacement of the acromion with narrowing of the neck (fig. 1 9A). Ground squirrel loadings on W9 indicate a much larger dorso-ventral component, especially in Ictidomys. The large transformations in this subgenus also include noticeable tilting of the acromion tip (fig. 19B), which rotates the acromioclavicular articulation counter to the rotation of the whole acromion represented by W6. Thus, the acromio-clavicular articulation surface is maintained in a relatively stable orientation through the dramatic changes of the acromion's position and orientation.",

Changes in the locations of the articulation, or in the positions of muscle or ligament attachments could produce new suites of coordinated shape changes. The complexity of postcranial skeletal evolution could be much greater than is generally appreciated. The analysis of sciurid scapulae also demonstrates the utility of thin-plate splines for studies of morphological transformations. The regionalization of the warps-that is, their ability to localize changes to distinct geographic regions of a starting form-is not just aesthetically attractive. By recourse to their geometry, shape change can be decomposed into biologically meaningful components. In addition, reference to the starting form facilitates phylogenetic analysis.",
