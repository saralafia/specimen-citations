The report of the third survey (Anderson et al., 1963) pertained to specimens of mammals in North American collections as of 1962.

Choate and Sydney Anderson, respectively) met to discuss ways in which systematic resources might be better utilized, to plan future meetings, and to coordinate the work of the two committees. Three fundamental questions were raised at that meeting: What and where are the systematic resources of mammalogy? How should they be maintained? How can they be made more accessible and used more effectively? It was decided that existing data (Anderson et al., 1963) on collections of mammals were sorely out of date, and that another current survey was needed, even though fewer than 20 years had passed since the previous one.",

Are they available in written form? Do you have immediate plans for active development of some form of electronic data processing as a means of assisting in collection management and information retrieval? Does the collection include specimens cited in the literature as being in a different collection (for example, a formerly private collection now deposited in an institutional collection)? What previously cited collections have been combined with yours? Will specimens be loaned for study (this presumes that loans are usually made to institutions rather than individuals and that adequate insurance will be carried during shipment; the loan of holotypes is not expected)? 18. Approximately how many such loans have been made in the past two years? How many specimens would you estimate were involved in those loans? 19. Is the collection in sufficient order to permit use by visiting investigators? Is someone usually available to aid an investigator who wishes to use the collection? Is it usually necessary to make arrangements in advance? 20. Is a special systematic library maintained near the collection? Do you regard the library as poor? fair? good? excellent? Is the library available to persons who might visit the collection? 21. Who are the professional scientists at your institution who use the collection, and what are their specialities? 22. In the past two years, how many students at your institution (if applicable) have used the collection directly in their thesis projects? How many for other projects? survey just completed than in the survey published in 1963. Most of these represent new collections, but a few are simply the result of more intensive sampling. There are fewer private collections of mammals, and fewer specimens in those collections, at this time than at any time since data on North American collections have been available. Conversely, the rates at which both the number of collections and the total number of specimens in those collections are growing have increased; Anderson et al. (1963) gave the percent increase in number of collections and number of specimens in the 20-year period between 1943 and 1962 as 20 and 69, respectively. This means that North American collections of mammals were growing at a rate of 3% percent per year between 1943 and 1962. In the 10year period between 1963 and 1973, the number of collections increased by 31 percent and the number of specimens by 60 percent. Therefore, the rate of growth of North American collections during this period has accelerated to 5% percent per year. The most rapid growth since the last survey is in collections of 10,000 to 19,999 specimens and collections of 1000 to 4999 specimens.",
