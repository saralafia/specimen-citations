Phillips of the Cleveland Museum of Natural History obtained two fringe-tailed bats, Alyotis thysanodes, at Jewel Cave, South Dakota. These specimens, subsequently reported by Bole (1935: 147-148) , were far to the east of the previously known range of the species, and have remained until now the only M. thysanodes on record from the Black Hills region. In July of 1965, a field party from the Museum of Natural History, The University of Kansas, netted a male of this species at the entrance to an abandoned mine in Weston County, Wyoming. Later in the same summer, Larry N. Brown and associates of The University of IVyoming captured a male in Custer County, South Dakota, and the following summer collected five additional specimens there. These, along with two individuals (one from South Dakota and one from Wyoming) previously reported in the literature as Alyotis euotis, bring to 11 the number of fringetailed bats known from the Black Hills.",
