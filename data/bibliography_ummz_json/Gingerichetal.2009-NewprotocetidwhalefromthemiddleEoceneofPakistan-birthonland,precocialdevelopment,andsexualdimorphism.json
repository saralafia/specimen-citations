    "abstract": "Background: Protocetidae are middle Eocene (49-37 Ma) archaeocete predators ancestral to later whales. They are found in marine sedimentary rocks, but retain four legs and were not yet fully aquatic. Protocetids have been interpreted as amphibious, feeding in the sea but returning to land to rest. Methodology/Principal Findings: Two adult skeletons of a new 2.6 meter long protocetid, Maiacetus inuus, are described from the early middle Eocene Habib Rahi Formation of Pakistan. M. inuus differs from contemporary archaic whales in having a fused mandibular symphysis, distinctive astragalus bones in the ankle, and a less hind-limb dominated postcranial skeleton. One adult skeleton is female and bears the skull and partial skeleton of a single large near-term fetus. The fetal skeleton is positioned for headfirst delivery, which typifies land mammals but not extant whales, evidence that birth took place on land. The fetal skeleton has permanent first molars well mineralized, which indicates precocial development at birth. Precocial development, with attendant size and mobility, were as critical for survival of a neonate at the land-sea interface in the Eocene as they are today. The second adult skeleton is the most complete known for a protocetid. The vertebral column, preserved in articulation, has 7 cervicals, 13 thoracics, 6 lumbars, 4 sacrals, and 21 caudals. All four limbs are preserved with hands and feet. This adult is 12% larger in linear dimensions than the female skeleton, on average, has canine teeth that are 20% larger, and is interpreted as male. Moderate sexual dimorphism indicates limited male-male competition during breeding, which in turn suggests little aggregation of food or shelter in the environment inhabited by protocetids. Conclusions/Significance: Discovery of a near-term fetus positioned for headfirst delivery provides important evidence that early protocetid whales gave birth on land. This is consistent with skeletal morphology enabling Maiacetus to support its weight on land and corroborates previous ideas that protocetids were amphibious. Specimens this complete are virtual 'Rosetta stones' providing insight into functional capabilities and life history of extinct animals that cannot be gained any other way.",

Protocetidae are middle Eocene in age (Lutetian-Bartonian, 49-37 Ma), and comprise fifteen genera and 16 species that range from South Asia and Africa to North America [2] . All are found in marine sedimentary rocks. The best known protocetids are 2 to 3-meter long primitive forms such as Artiocetus and Rodhocetus represented by skulls and partial skeletons with artiodactyl-like ankle bones [3] . These were amphibious foot-powered swimmers [4] that retained fully developed hind limbs connected to the vertebral column, enabling limb-supported locomotion on land. Maiacetus, described below, was part of this early diversification ( Figure 1C , D). Basal archaeocetes have long been interpreted as amphibious, feeding in the sea but returning to land to rest, mate, and give birth [5, 6] .",

Here again the anterior rostrum is narrow but it expands rapidly at mid length toward the posterior end of the skull. The palate is much broader posteriorly than it is anteriorly. The frontal shield is expanded with broad supraorbital processes, but it is again narrower than that of later protocetids. Lacrimal bones are exposed on the face anterior to the orbits. The high, narrow, and deep nuchal area is bordered ventrolaterally by robust, broadlyspaced parocciptal processes, suggesting the presence of powerful neck muscles.

Precaudal vertebrae increase in size along the series as in other protocetids ( Table 3 ). The atlas (C1) has broad transverse processes, moderately deep and curved prezygapophyses, and a complex foraminal pathway for the vertebral arteries to accommodate motion of the skull. In C3-C7 the orientation of zygapophyses, the saddle-shape of vertebral body surfaces, and the imbrication of transverse processes suggest that the neck was more capable of dorsiflexion than lateral rotation. Anterior thoracic vertebrae have long spinous processes for muscles and ligaments inserting on the exoccipital region and nuchal area of the skull to stabilize the head. Thoracic T11, the diaphragmatic vertebra, has thoracic-like prezygapophyses and lumbar-like postzygapophyses. T12 is the anticlinal vertebra with a vertical neural spine ( Figure 1A) . In the lumbus, anterodorsally inclined spinous processes, non-revolute zygapophyses, and the anteroventral orientation of transverse processes indicate the potential for dorsoventral flexion of the trunk and vertebral column in general. Flexion, however, was limited by the anteroposterior width and length of the spinous processes of the lumbar vertebrae.",

The cuneiforms are small and subrectangular with simple articular surfaces for the second and third metatarsals (Mt-II and Mt-III). It is possible that a tiny distal extension of the entocuneiform accommodated a very diminutive (but unrecovered) Mt-I. A pair of proximal articular surfaces on the cuboid include a concave medial portion for the astragalus and an obliquely notched, flatter surface for articulation with the distal surface of the calcaneum.

While the hind limbs were capable of bearing the weight of the body on land, the proportions of the limbs and the long phalanges of both hands and feet would have limited terrestrial locomotion and prevented Maiacetus from traveling any substantial distance from water. Maiacetus differs from other early protocetids in having dentaries fused at the mandibular symphysis ( Figure 5 ), ankles of distinct proportions (Figure 11) , and limbs slightly different in proportion from those of other early protocetids (Figures 12, 13 ).

Hence they could no longer come out of the sea onto land to give birth. With their innominate decoupled from the vertebral column, the birth canal in basilosaurids may have been considerably larger than that in protocetids.

Here partial crowns of the first permanent upper molars (left and right M 1 ) are visible posterior to dP 4 (best exposed on the left side). The main paracone cusp appears almost fully formed, with the crown as a whole being about one-half mineralized. Formation of the crowns of many deciduous teeth, and particularly formation of M 1 , indicates that the fetal skeleton of Maiacetus was advanced in development and near full term. Altricial-to-precocial birth status in mammals is generally represented on a behavioral spectrum scored from I to IV. Altricial I lies at one extreme ('birth with eyes closed, naked, and nidicolousor nest-dwelling'), and precocial IV at the other ('birth with eyes open, haired, and nidifugous or nest-fleeing') [21] . Dental development provides a parallel indication of birth status (Table 4 ). The state of the dentition at birth is a direct indicator of the ability of a newborn to supplement mother's milk with other foods. Natural selection can separately adjust a newborn's ability to feed itself, sense its environment, regulate its temperature, and move [24] , yet there is also an overall association of these aspects of newborn maturity. Table 4 shows that mineralization of the Figure 12 . Proportion-adjusted skeletal profiles of middle and late Eocene archaeocete whales Maiacetus inuus and Dorudon atrox, respectively. (A)-Maiacetus inuus, a semiaquatic foot-powered swimmer from the Middle Eocene. (B)-Dorudon atrox, a fully-aquatic tail-powered swimmer from the Late Eocene. Baseline is mean length of anterior thoracic vertebrae (stippled box). Sacral vertebrae are enclosed in a second stippled box where sacrals can be identified (e.g., by co-ossification). Maiacetus has a profile more like that of mammals capable of supporting their weight on land, whereas Dorudon has the profile of a modern whale. Interpretation of profiles and the method of median serial-multiple-regression estimation of body weights is explained in [50] .

In generalized mammals, crowns of the deciduous dentition appear to be largely mineralized in utero. The permanent dentition, however, shows an enormous range, with some mammals showing no mineralization of permanent teeth at all (e.g., a newborn bear cub [22] ), and others having all adult crowns fully formed (e.g., newborn guinea pig [23] ). While eruption of teeth through the gums in living mammals is informative, the clearest association with precocial categories II-IV is some degree of mineralization of the permanent dentition, beginning with the first molar and in some cases extending to mineralization of later developing teeth.",

A 12% difference in linear measurements of male and female Maiacetus yields an expected weight difference of about 39% (Table 1) . Relatively large canines are commonly found in male mammals that use these teeth in threat displays and fighting. In addition, the pelvis of GSP-UM 3551 is well preserved and has a V-shaped pubic notch, formed by the inferior rami of the left and right pubes, which is characteristic of males ( Figure 10) . The notch is broader and U-shaped in females that give birth to a single large fetus, such as the fallow deer Dama dama [29] .",

Here we quantify the difference in terms of body length (Figure 15 ). The mating system is not known for all marine mammals, but when known, a malefemale length difference greater than about 16% (0.15 on a natural log scale) indicates a territorial or harem mating system [31] . Intense male-male competition is associated with marked sexual dimorphism and often spatial aggregation of females related to the accessibility of food and shelter. A male-female length difference less than 16% corresponds to a more generalized 'aquatic,' or 'dispersed', mating system, in which males have less opportunity to guard and monopolize females.",

Because early whales evolved from artiodactyls [3] , Ovis, Dama, Hexaprotodon, and Giraffa are better analogs than primates. probably limited male-male competition for mates. Limited opportunity to monopolize mates suggests in turn that food and shelter were dispersed in protocetid habitats. This is corroborated by the geographically extensive but environmentally uniform shallow marine deposits of the Habib Rahi Formation, which were deposited on a broad, shallow marine shelf that would have provided little spatial aggregation of food or shelter. Much remains to be learned about mating systems in cetaceans because their behavior is so difficult to study [32] . At present, body size dimorphism is itself sometimes used as a measure of 'contest competition' between males [17] . Maiacetus suggests that sexual dimorphism appeared early in cetacean evolution. Males were larger than females, but the difference was modest on the scale of dimorphism observed in marine mammals today.",

Maiacetus differs in size and proportions from younger, more derived basilosaurids such as Dorudon atrox (Figures 1, 12, 13 ), but it is close in size and similar in proportions to a composite skeleton of Rodhocetus balochistanensis/kasranii (Figure 13 ). Maiacetus retains many characteristics of its terrestrial forebears, including shearing cheek teeth with protocones on upper molars, a vertebral formula very close to that of primitive artiodactyls, a forelimb retaining mobile digits, a pelvis and hindlimb anchored on the vertebral column; and a double-pulley astragalus within the ankle. The feet of Maiacetus are not as elongated as those of Rodhocetus, indicating that Maiacetus may have been a slightly less specialized foot-powered swimmer (Figure 13 ).",

This, in turn, indicates that birth almost certainly took place on land during this phase of early whale evolution. The presence of partially mineralized permanent first molars in the fetal skull indicates precocial development, which may have been a key life history trait in early whales facilitating the transition from land to sea. Sexual dimorphism in body and canine size are moderate, suggesting limited competition among males for mates. Figure 15 . Mating systems and sexual dimorphism in marine mammals. Sexual dimorphism of males and females is quantified for 105 species of cetaceans, pinnipeds, sirenians, and the sea otter, expressed as male-minus-female length in natural log units [17, 30] . Territorial and harem systems that involve intense male-male competition and spatial aggregation of females have male-female dimorphism greater than about 0.15 (dashed line) [31] . Maiacetus inuus falls in the group of 'dispersed' mating systems with limited aggregation and limited male control of mating. Both cetaceans and pinnipeds span the entire range shown here, although mating systems are known for relatively few species [32] . doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0004366.g015",
