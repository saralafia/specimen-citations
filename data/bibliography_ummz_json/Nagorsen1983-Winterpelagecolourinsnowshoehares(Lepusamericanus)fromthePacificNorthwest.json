The moults are initiated by changes in phot.operiod (Lyman 1943) but temperature probably modifies the precise timing of moults (Rust 1962; Watson 1963) . Snowshoe hares that are brown in winter temperatures average well above freezing at San Francisco (Dale 1966), these hares acquired a white pelage each winter in captivity. The study skin of one individual (CAS 230) that died in captivity February 13 is indistinguishable from specimens taken in midwinter at Lake Tahoe. Snowshoe hares from the Olympic Mountains of Washington provide additional evidence for the -genetic basis of winter coat colour. A series of snowshoe hares in the Puget Sound University collection that were taken in winter at about 1800m elevation in the Olympics are completely brown. Snow cover in the Olympics exists continuously in winter at elevations above 450-900 m (Phillips 1965) . Several mammals that acquire a white pelage in winter have populations that are brown or partly brown in regions with moderate winter climates and little snow. Such variation in winter colour usually has been attributed to selection for cryptic colouration. Hall (195 1) reported brown and white morphs in the North American weasels Mustela eminea, M. rzivalis, and M. frenata. Moreover, Hall (1951) found transition zones where brown and white individuals coexist. Similarly, white-tailed jack-Can. J. Zool.

Coastal lowlands of Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia are characterized by mild winter temperatures and heavy winter precipitation mostly in the form of rain. Winter snowfall in this region is sporadic and persists for short periods of time. East of the Cascades and Coast Mountains in the interior of British Columbia, northeastern Washington, and the Blue Mountains of Washington and Oregon winters are colder with continuous snow cover (Sternes 1960; Phillips 1965; Potter 1965) . Similarly the altitudinal range inhabited by L. americanus in the Sierra Nevada of California has heavy snowfall (Dale 1966) . The existence of the brown morph above the snow line in the Olympic Mountains, however, contradicts the correlation between white pelage and snow cover. Intense selection for the brown morph in surrounding lowland areas and gene flow among populations at different elevations in the Olympics may have resulted in the loss of the alleles for the white morph in populations occupying the small area above the snow line in these mountains. Another possible explanation is that the brown morph evolved during the Pleistocene in the unglaciated region along the Pacific coast of the western United States where a maritime climate would have favoured selection for a brown pelage in winter (Dalquest 1948; Nagorsen 1982) . Populations of L. americanus that inhabit the Olympic Mountains could be derived from these coastal populations as a result of postglacial dispersion.",

I am particularly grateful to Murray Johnson for allowing me to examine his series of study skins from the Olympic Mountains and for sharing his knowledge on mammals of the Pacific Northwest. Robert Orr kindly provided information on his experiments on moults in captive snowshoe hares. I thank an anonymous reviewer for valuable suggestions and criticisms of the manuscript.
