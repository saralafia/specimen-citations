In that systematic review Howell listed two specimens from Teopisca under the name G. v. goldmani, Teopisca is located at an elevation of about 6000 feet in central Chiapas. He also stated that flying squirrels were reported to occur at Pinal de Amoles in northeastern Quere\u2022 taro. These apparently were the only records known to him of the occurrence of the species in Mexico. Following are other r.ecords of the species in the Republic. Goldman (Jour. Wash. Acad. Sci., 26: 463,1936 ) mentions three specimens. One, the holotype of G. v. her-TeTanus, is listed as taken in the mountains of Veracruz. The other two are reported to have been secured in the Sierra Madre of Chihuahua; they are the basis for the name G. v. madrensis. On 14 January 1949 Dr. H. O. Wagner trapped a flying squirrel in a forest of large oaks at an elevation of about 9500 feet on Cerro San Felipe, Oaxaca. That specimen is now con~ tained in the University of Michigan Museum of Zoology. On 18 February 1949 Dr. George M. Sutton saw a flying squirrel glide from one pine tree to another in a pine-oak forest located 9 kilometers (by highway) south of Patzcuaro, Michoacan. It was at dusk when he made the observation; he noticed a bat flying overhead shortly before he saw the squirrel. In early March, 1949, natives of Los Pescados, a village located at an elevation of about 10,000 feet on the north slope of the Cofre de Perote, Veracruz, reported that they occasionally saw small squirrels that came out at night and that glided from tree to tree .. Their free description of the habits and appearance of the animals in question seemed to us to fit flying squirrell!J precisely. These several records indicate that the range of the species Glaucomys volans is much larger than previously has been suspected. It probably encompasses most of the high mountains of Mexico.",

Compared with the holotype of goldmani, the San Felipe specimen is paler and less reddish dorsally and is a paler buff ventrally. The paratype of goldmani also is darker dorsally; it has a strong pinkish cinnamon wash on the chest, belly, and lower thighs that is not seen in the San Felipe specimen. The holotype of madrensis is badly worn and faded; the paratype also is faded. Apparently originally both were paler dorsally and ventrally than is the Oaxacan specimen. Whether OUr specimen represents a geographic race different from any of the three now ascribed to the Republic can not be determined until variation in the species in Mexico is better understood. For convenience in filing in the, Museum collections the specimen is identified as G. v. goldmani, the nominal form with which it agrees best.- ",
