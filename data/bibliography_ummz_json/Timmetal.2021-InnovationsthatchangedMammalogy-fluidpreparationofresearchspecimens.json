In addition to the several hundred gallons of rum on board for consumption by the sailors (the infamous \"tot\" British rum ration), the young naturalist had gallons of \"spirits of wine\" for preservation of specimens. In that era, it was known that spirits of wine (ethyl alcohol, probably the commonly available second distillation of around 60-65% or stronger) was better at preserving specimens than rum (usually no more than 40%). He was to have provided all equipment necessary for the 5-year voyage round the world; however, it isn't certain if he purchased the ethanol (with his father's funds) to preserve the scientific specimens he would collect or if it was from the allotment required for the medical work on board the ship. Nearly two centuries later, some of Darwin's fluid-preserved specimens are still available for examination in the University Museum of Zoology, University of Cambridge (Fig. 1) .",

By the 1800s, ethanol was considered the superior alcohol for specimen preparation. Rum, which is distilled from sugar cane, was not always considered one of the better spirits for preservation, despite what Audubon told young Baird back in 1840, because it is usually no more than 40% alcohol. Brandy-an alcohol produced by distilling wine-was considered early on by some as better. Simmons (2014) detailed the controversy in the British press in the early 1800s when a Royal Navy surgeon preserved the body of Admiral Lord Nelson in a cask of brandy rather than using rum to ship it back to England after Nelson was killed in the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. Perhaps some of the controversy stemmed from the ethanol content of brandy, which by volume could have ranged from 35% to 60%, with the higher concentrations of alcohol being more effective for specimen preparation.",

                "text": "The discovery in the early 1890s that formalin effectively diffused into tissues is generally attributed to German 2 JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY industrial chemist Ferdinand Blum who found that the skin on his fingertips hardened when handling it. Formalin subsequently replaced alcohol as the medium of choice for anatomical preparations in part because it diffuses through tissues faster, is an effective antibiotic, acts by cross-linking proteins, and was relatively inexpensive. In laboratory experiments, formalin diffused through a medium nearly five times faster than ethanol (Macintyre 2018) . Formalin fixes tissue or cells by irreversibly denaturing cellular proteins. It acts in connecting a primary amine group in a protein molecule with nearby nitrogen in a protein or DNA molecule causing nucleic acids to fragment due to extremely low pH. The denatured proteins are a poor nutrient source for bacteria and thus bacterial decomposition is reduced, resulting in better preservation of the anatomical features. Formalin is produced when formaldehyde gas is bubbled through water and is soluble up to approximately a 40% concentration: 10% formalin is actually 3.7% aqueous formaldehyde. A buffered fixative mixture containing 10% formalin has been the standard in vertebrate specimen preparation for several decades (Simmons 2014) . Sir Peter Medawar, Nobel Prize laureate in medicine and author of several seminal papers on mammals, developed a coefficient of diffusibility for fixatives in 1941 that is known as the Medawar constant or K value. The depth penetrated by the fixative is proportional to the square root of time, with the higher the K value the faster the rate of penetration. Reviews of the rich history of fluid preservation of specimens, documenting some of the early history and array of chemicals used for initial preservation and fixation were provided by Williams and Hawks (1987) and Simmons (2014 Simmons ( , 2020 .",

Thus, further refinement to the use of formalin in preservation of vertebrates included the use of a buffer because decalcification of bones can start at pH 6.4 and below, and at 7.0 and above. It was found that the best tissue preparations are buffered to bring the pH close to 7 and that formalin must be buffered within a fairly narrow range. Too much buffering considerably alters the osmotic concentration of the solution causing cells to rupture. Initially, field preparations of vertebrates were buffered by adding some small, unmeasured amount of sodium bicarbonate or sodium borate, usually purchased as baking soda, baking powder, or borax, to the formalin. A quick, simple buffering of 1 teaspoon per liter brought formalin to a pH of about 7 and was used in field preparations for several years. However, these no longer are recommended buffers. Over time, for example, borax will acidify as boric acid and fail as a formalin buffer.",

The stronger the alcohol however, the more dehydration occurs, prohibiting penetration through tissues. Today we know that ethanol works quite well as an initial fixative and eliminates the problems associated with other alcohols and formalin. Both 70% and 95% EtOH impart the desired biocide properties needed for long-term preservation (Simmons 2014) . However, 95% ethanol doesn't diffuse as well through tissues as does 70% because dehydrated cells prohibit its passing. The moisture in specimens, however, dilutes the alcohol used as a fixative. Thus, thorough careful injection of 70% ethanol into the larger muscle masses helps overcome the problem of penetration and is highly recommended.",

After the initial fixation, most museum specimens should be stored in 70% ethanol (Simmons 2014) . Ideally, prior to preservation, tissues should be removed and preserved separately and promptly at \u221280\u00b0C for DNA analyses. \"Absolute alcohol (100 percent ethanol) and other EtOH concentrations above 96 percent are not recommended for DNA preservation because the alcohol is chemically denatured (e.g., with benzene, hydrochloric acid, or some combination of the more than 100 other denaturants approved for use in the US) and traces of the denaturing agents may remain that will degrade DNA\" (Simmons 2014:60) .",

These slices can be viewed on common image software (e.g., GIMP, Illustrator, ImageJ, and Photoshop), or they can be used to produce three-dimensional (3-D) derivatives of the scanned specimen with proprietary packages, such as Avizo, Dragonfly, 3-D Slicer, Mimics, or Volume Graphics StudioMax. Detailed 3-D images allow in-depth study of morphological structures to better visualize, assess, and quantify specimen data to study function and reconstruct evolution. Thousands of 3-D images of CT scanned fluid-preserved vertebrates from natural history collections are now available publicly on MorphoSource.org.",

During this time, we have seen new uses that have altered the process of preservation to better enhance long-term conservation, provide better access to information locked within each specimen, and minimize users' exposure to harmful chemicals. The history of fluid preservation illustrates this evolution of preservation and use. Just as no one could have foreseen in the early 1900s that egg collections would be used to understand the disastrous impacts of DDT on wildlife, Darwin, Audubon, and Baird could never have foreseen that their fluid-preserved specimens could be used for 3-D CT scanning. Today, preparation of specimens using ethanol with thorough, careful injection is producing excellent results and fluid preparations have come a full circle back to alcohol. The ongoing challenge confronting today's field biologists and those who care for scientific collections continues to be how to best preserve specimens so that they will be available for future generations and new innovations, while minimizing the risks of handling those specimens.",
