However, the diversity of microorganisms constitutes the majority of all life forms on Earth. Here, we ask if the patterns of richness inferred for macro-organisms are similar for microorganisms. For this, we barcoded samples of soil, litter and insects from four localities on a west-to-east transect across Amazonia. We quantified richness as Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) in those samples using three molecular markers. We then compared OTU richness with species richness of two relatively wellstudied organism groups in Amazonia: trees and birds. We find that OTU richness shows a declining west-to-east diversity gradient that is in agreement with the species richness patterns documented here and previously for birds and trees. These results suggest that most taxonomic groups respond to the same overall diversity gradients at large spatial scales. However, our results show a different pattern of richness in relation to habitat types, suggesting that the idiosyncrasies of each taxonomic group and peculiarities of the local environment frequently override large-scale diversity gradients. Our findings caution against using the diversity distribution of one taxonomic group as an indication of patterns of richness across all groups. Despite significant advances in our understanding of global biodiversity, a fundamental question remains poorly understood 1 : Do the same ecological patterns apply to macro and micro-organisms?

Some studies have already assessed the correlations between the diversity of macro and micro-organisms. On a global scale, a mismatch of diversity was found between below-ground organisms (bacteria, fungi and mesofauna) and above-ground organisms (mammal, birds, amphibians and vascular plants) 9 . Furthermore, bacterial diversity was higher in temperate regions, while fungi showed a weak latitudinal pattern 10 . In another study, fungal diversity displayed a latitudinal gradient but was uncorrelated with plant diversity 11 . For Neotropical forests, protists showed the same pattern of diversity as macro-organisms 12 , and fungi and bacteria followed the elevational gradient of diversity in the Andes 13 . The pattern of richness of fungi and bacteria in the mineral soil, however, was different from that of plants, not linear, with fungi having the lowest richness in median elevation and bacteria the highest 13 . In this context, the congruence or divergence in diversity across taxa remains unclear. This is problematic, since micro-organims are the most diverse and abundant groups in any habitat 14 and are essential for ecosystem function 15 and the fitness of higher organisms 16 , meaning that general insights into the distribution and drivers of diversity require their inclusion 17 .",

Amazonia is the world's largest and most biodiverse tropical forest. On a large spatial scale, most macroscopic taxa show consistent patterns of diversity, possibly as a response to abiotic conditions and processes [18] [19] [20] . In this region, one of the most conspicuous patterns of species richness in well-studied groups, such as birds and trees, is a west-to-east diversity gradient: from the highly diverse areas on the eastern Andean slopes to the relatively less diverse areas on the Guiana Shield in the north and eastern Amazonian lowlands [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . Several explanations for this pattern have been suggested, including the effects of marine incursions [23] [24] [25] , bedrock geology 26 , mountain base formation 18 , soil fertility 18, 27 and, more recently, a diversification process driven by moisture 28 .",

                "text": "While most of Amazonia is covered by lowland non-flooded terra-firme forests, several other vegetation types, such as flooded forests or white sand ecosystems, are common and widespread throughout the basin. Patterns of plant and avian diversity vary dramatically with vegetation type; as a general rule, terra-firme forests are more diverse than seasonally flooded forests [29] [30] [31] . Forests that are seasonally flooded by nutrient-rich, white-water rivers (v\u00e1rzeas) are more diverse than forests seasonally flooded by acidic, nutrient-poor black-water rivers (igap\u00f3s 31, 32 ). Finally, both types of flooded forests are more diverse than naturally open areas on nutrient-impoverished sandy soils (campinas 31, [33] [34] [35] [36] ). The drivers of these patterns remain elusive but may be associated with geological processes, soil fertility, inundation gradient, type of water 37 and also with the size and fragmented distribution of these \"smaller vegetation types\" on which the colonization of species may be in part attributed to chance 38, 39 . However, such patterns could in principle be specific to plants and vertebrates. Other taxa, such as fungi, bacteria and other micro-organisms could display different diversity patterns. Indeed, in a previous study using part of our data, we found different patterns for micro-organismal richness among Amazonian habitat types 40 , but a similar pattern of higher terra-firme diversity than campina diversity was found for fungi in Colombian Amazonia 41 . The contrasting patterns between micro-and macro-organisms may have major implications for our understanding of general diversity patterns and for conservation.",

For this purpose, we compare OTU richness generated from environmental sequencing in four Amazonian localities, with richness estimates from existing taxonomic inventories for trees and birds in the vicinity (Fig. 1 ). For the OTU analyses, we examine three different sample types (soil, litter and insect bulk samples) and three sequence markers (the ribosomal 16S, 18S and the mitochondrial COI, which target prokaryotes, eukaryotes and metazoans, respectively). We test if large-scale diversity patterns known from plants and birds (increasing richness from east-to-west and from campinas to flooded forests and to terra-firme forests) can be recovered with our OTU and inventory data. If OTUs and traditional taxonomic species richness show approximately the same diversity patterns, metabarcoding could offer a rapid and cost-effective alternative for biodiversity assessments, without the demand for taxonomic expertise. In that case, the detection and protection of high diversity areas would be facilitated [43] [44] [45] , and taxonomists could focus on species descriptions and other important directions of research, rather than spending time on routine identifications. If, however, OTU richness and species richness are decoupled, the idiosyncrasies of each taxonomic group would make generalizations difficult and call into question our current understanding of the distribution of biodiversity in the world's largest rainforest. Importantly, a rapid and reliable assessment of Amazonian diversity is increasingly crucial, as deforestation rates are currently escalating to alarmingly high levels 46 .",

The taxa with the highest number of identified OTUs across all samples were: Alphaproteobacteria (15%), Acidobacteria (10%), Planctomycetes (10%), Bacteroidetes (10%), Actinobacteria (10%) and Chloroflexi (10%) ( Fig. 2A) for prokaryotes (the 16S marker); and Fungi (20%, mainly Ascomycota and Basidiomycota), Cercozoa (15%) and Alveolata (10%) ( Fig. 2B ) for eukaryotes (the 18S marker). For the COI marker, the taxa with the highest number of OTUs were Fungi (30%, mainly Ascomycota and Basidiomycota) followed by Hexapoda (10%; Fig. 2C ). The proportion of unclassified OTUs was around 10%, 25% and 40% for 16S, 18S and COI, respectively, reflecting the incompleteness of public databases for these markers, beyond the possible sequence errors/chimeras. The lack of representative sequences is more problematic for COI, since usually this marker is sequenced just for metazoans. Map of sampling localities. Circles represent plots pertaining to the Amazon Tree Diversity Network (ATDN) used in this study, which represent different forest types: igap\u00f3s (orange), v\u00e1rzeas (blue) and terrafirme (green). The semi-transparent polygons show the interfluves from which those plots were selected. Squares represent the locations of the metabarcoding sampling that were compared to the ATDN data. In each locality, we sampled different habitats: in Benjamin Constant (BC) we sampled terra-firme, igap\u00f3s and v\u00e1rzeas; in Ja\u00fa (JAU) and Cuieras (CUI) we sampled terra-firme, campinas and igap\u00f3s. At each of the three localities we sampled nine plots. In Caxiuan\u00e3 we sampled terra-firme, campinas, v\u00e1rzeas and igap\u00f3s, totaling 12 plots.

These results suggest that at the regional scale, the diversity distribution of one taxonomic group should not be used as a general proxy for diversity of another, nor as an indication of overall patterns of richness. At small spatial scales, the idiosyncrasies of each taxonomic group and the peculiarities of each environment appear to be more important than general diversity patterns, which differ among organism types. It is important to acknowledge that we compared data aggregated at different spatial scales and generated using different methods in order to produce the richness estimates used here. In addition, there are differences in the exact locations of the trees surveyed and the metabarcoding plots sampled for this study. These considerations make a direct comparison of richness challenging and worth further exploration by future studies based on primary inventories. However, our primary aim was to assess correlations between proxies of species richness. This means that despite these challenges, if the regional-scale processes are important (locality, habitat type), the levels of alpha diversity should increase as a function of the source pool (unsaturated type I relation 47, 48 ). Therefore, if the west-to-east gradient or habitat differences hold true for all samples, a positive and significant relationship should be found across our data sets. If not, this would suggest that other factors may be more important in determining richness from local to regional scales.",

Both of these groups were abundant in our samples, accounting for 35% of our 16S data ( Fig. 2A) .

Previous studies have reported a decoupling between fungi and plant diversity worldwide 11 whereas others have found a positive relationship 13, 41 and a similar community turnover 54 . For other groups, such as insects, diversity is often positively correlated with plant diversity 55, 56 . Additionally, soil protists can have similar biogeographic patterns to macro-organisms in lowland Neotropical rainforests 12 , which is expected to have a positive effect in the regression of protist OTUs and tree and bird species richness. Our data showed similar patterns overall for metazoans, fungi and protists for these same markers (Table S2 , Fig. S1 ). However, our results highlight the need for further exploration of biotic interactions and diversity metrics, as contrasting results can be found within the same taxonomic groups (e.g. fungi sequenced with 18S and COI, Fig. S1 ).",

A positive correlation with this diversity should be found if all groups shared the same overall diversity pattern due only to the same abiotic conditions (e.g. moisture 28 , nutrient levels 59 or geology 26 ), yet regional and local deviations appear idiosyncratic among taxa. For instance, the combined data from the Amazon Tree Diversity Network across the entire Amazon basin cleary show a west-to-east diversity gradient, but contain multiple outliers in the eastern part of the Negro River close to the Cuieiras area surveyed here 21 . This is consistent with the observed higher-than-expected tree richness in terra-firme from Cuieras as revealed from our data ( Fig. 4D ) and this may have affected the results of our regressions due to our limited sampling. In addition, Benjamin Constant has the poorest bird inventories, possibly resulting in underestimated richness for this area in our data.",

This habitat is usually considered less diverse for macro-organisms than more forested habitats in Amazonia, such as terra-firme and flooded forests 18, 20, 21, 33, 36 , a relationship confirmed for Colombian Amazonian fungi 41 . Previous studies have reported on the importance of campinas for beta-diversity 36 , but these habitats have long been considered species-poor environments 60 . In contrast, our results suggest that these environments may be hyperdiverse for microbial diversity (Fig. 4A-C) . However, we note that campinas have an insular distribution in Amazonia, being surrounded by a \"sea\" of terra-firme forests 61, 62 . OTU diversity in these patches could, potentially, be over-estimated due to DNA transported from nearby forest species, for instance through leaves, fungal spores and other debris 63 . This effect will be hard to test, but it is important to stress that the community composition of campinas was significantly different from the other habitats 40, 64 and there is a rich micro-organismal community that is genuinely from campinas.",

However, within each taxonomic group, the species richness should be consistent across these scales if the west-to-east and habitat gradients are the dominating factors explaining the richness gradient. The outliers in our data (e.g. tree richness in Cuieras and OTU richness in campinas) may have had the strongest effect in the general regression between the OTUs and species richness for birds and for trees. For trees, the pattern we recovered reflects outliers already identified in a previous study 21 . These considerations suggest that even with the different spatial scales used here and in other studies, if the west-to-east gradient was the strongest factor explaining diversity, it should produce a positive correlation.

The results for A-C indicate that OTU richness varies significantly with location and habitat type, with the highest overall richness obtained from 16S data.

The findings from this and previous studies that micro-and macro-organismal diversity are often decoupled has important implications for conservation. It is genuinely worrying in the context of bioversity loss 70 , since a large proportion of the world's biodiversity may be lost without notice, particularly in Amazonia 46 . Micro-organisms are essential for ecosystem functioning, as they constitute the majority of the diversity of any ecosystem. As highlighted by O'Malley & Dupr\u00e9 17 , the excessive focus on macro-organisms may have distorted our understanding of general patterns of biodiversity.

In particular, patterns in the diversity of micro-organisms (which comprise the bulk of the total diversity) differ strongly from patterns in birds and plants, particulary in connection with habitat type. Furthermore, we found large differences in species richness and diversity patterns between i) metabarcoding of environmental samples and nearby taxonomic inventories, and ii) different genetic markers used for DNA barcoding. Importantly, our results suggest that diversity patterns differ considerably among taxonomic groups, making the use of single taxa as a proxy for total diversity problematic, especially for conservation purposes.

We collected mineral soil, litter (the organic matter above the mineral soil) and insects in three plots in each major vegetation type present at each locality (3 to 4 depending on the locality; see ref. 40 for more details) in November 2015. First, we installed a SLAM trap in the middle of each plot. SLAM traps are dome-shaped, tent-like insect traps made of fine mesh-netting, widely used in entomological studies and aimed at capturing strong-flying insects that typically fly upwards after hitting a fine-scale net (e.g. wasps, mosquitos and butterflies). These insects were ultimately trapped in a bottle filled with ethanol at 96% concentration. The traps were kept open for 24 hours in each plot. After capture, the insects were preserved in a clean plastic bottle with new 96% ethanol until DNA extraction. We sampled soils and litter following Tedersoo et al. 11 to minimize information loss while keeping comparability between this and other large-scale studies. First, 20 trees were randomly selected within a 28 m radius of each SLAM trap. To reduce the risk of contamination, we wore gloves and a nose-and-mouth mask and replaced the gloves between each sampled tree. We sampled litter and soil cores in opposite directions of each selected tree. In total, 40 soil and 40 litter samples were collected per plot. The soil and litter samples were subsequently pooled into one combined soil and one combined litter sample for each plot. The litter consisted of all organic material above the mineral soil and varied from 0-50 cm in thickness. We then collected soil in the same places, with the samples taken from the top 5 cm of the mineral soil using a metal probe with a 2.5 cm diameter. The soil probe was sterilized with fire after collecting soil from both sides of each tree to prevent cross-contamination between samples. The samples were stored in plastic bags with the same weight of sterilized white silica gel (14 mm silica grain size). The silica was pre-treated for two minutes in a microwave oven (800 W) and exposed to 15 min of UV light to prevent contamination in our samples from any micro-organisms present in the silica. All plots were tagged with GPS coordinates. All dry soil, litter samples and ethanol insect samples were processed at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden. For more details of the collection protocol, see ref. 43 . www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ DNA extraction. For soil, 10 g (dry weight) of each sample and 15 ml of each litter sample (corresponding to 3-10 g of dry weight litter, depending on texture and composition of each sample) and a negative control were processed for total DNA extraction using the PowerMax \u00ae Soil DNA Isolation Kit (MO BIO Laboratories), according to the manufacturer's instructions (see details in ref. 40 ). For insects, we followed the non-destructive protocol described in Aljanabi and Martinez 72 , we also included a negative control for insect extractions.",

This transformation normalizes the count data with respect to sample size (number of reads in each sample) and variances, based on fitted dispersion-mean relationships 91 . As the results were virtually identical (Pearson correlation > 0.99 for all data sets) we used the richness based on rarefaction of OTUs for further analyses, since we had no abundance data for birds and just richness measurements was possible. The results of both richness by rarefaction and Shannon estimated are presented in Table S2 . As we had three plots in each environment at each locality, we used the mean of the three plots for each environment at each locality.",

We used this method to control for nested sampling 94 , because our plots are nested in the habitat types and we pooled all of them into one regression, but they might differ in their intercept. In this case a mixed effects model would be better suited, since it allows different intercepts. To test the relationship between OTU richness and species richness, we also fitted generalized linear mixed effects models using the OTU richness as the response variable and the genetic marker (16S, 18S and COI), sample type (soil, litter and insects) and tree or bird richness as explanatory variables. We used the Poisson family distribution in the model and considered locality and habitat type as random effects in both analyses. Because the organisms' body size 95 and/or the taxonomic reponses to environmental conditions 10 could affect the diversity patterns, we also divided our data into 16S that comprises mostly bacteria and divided our 18S and COI data between protists, fungi and metazoan, and fitted generalized linear mixed effects models separately for each data sets.",

We assessed the relationship of these variables based on a two-tailed binomial distribution only focusing on the sign of the relationship. The null expectation is that ~50% of all relationships would be positive and ~50% would be negative if there were no underlying patterns and the relationships were independent of each other. An overabundance of either positive or negative relationships can therefore be seen as a significant deviation from the null-expectation. In our analyses, we carried out a total of nine tests (OTU richness for 3 markers and 3 sample types). The combined probability of achieving 0, 1, 8 or 9 positive outcomes out of nine attempts if both positive and negative relationships are equally likely is 0.039. We therefore considered a relationship where 0, 1, 8 or 9 of the slopes were positive as significant.",
