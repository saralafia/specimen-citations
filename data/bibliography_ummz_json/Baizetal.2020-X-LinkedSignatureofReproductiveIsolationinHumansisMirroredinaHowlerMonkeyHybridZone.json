While sex chromosomes have been linked to reproductive isolation in many model systems, including hominids, genetic studies of the contribution of sex chromosome loci to speciation for natural populations are relatively sparse. Natural hybrid zones can help identify genomic regions contributing to reproductive isolation, like hybrid incompatibility loci, since these regions exhibit reduced introgression between parental species. Here, we use a primate hybrid zone (Alouatta palliata \u00d7 Alouatta pigra) to test for reduced introgression of X-linked SNPs compared to autosomal SNPs. To identify X-linked sequence in A. palliata, we used a sex-biased mapping approach with whole-genome re-sequencing data. We then used genomic cline analysis with reduced-representation sequence data for parental A. palliata and A. pigra individuals and hybrids (n = 88) to identify regions with non-neutral introgression. We identified ~26 Mb of non-repetitive, putatively X-linked genomic sequence in A. palliata, most of which mapped collinearly to the marmoset and human X chromosomes. We found that X-linked SNPs had reduced introgression and an excess of ancestry from A. palliata as compared to autosomal SNPs. One outlier region with reduced introgression overlaps a previously described \"desert\" of archaic hominin ancestry on the human X chromosome. These results are consistent with a large role for the X chromosome in speciation across animal taxa and further, suggest shared features in the genomic basis of the evolution of reproductive isolation in primates.",

Some contemporary humans with ancestors from outside of Africa carry as much as ~5% archaic DNA as a result of ancient admixture with Neanderthals and Denisovans (Sankararaman et al. 2014 (Sankararaman et al. , 2016 . However, there are many regions of reduced ancestry from archaic hominins in modern human genomes (i.e., \"deserts\" of archaic ancestry), which are highly enriched on the X chromosome (Sankararaman et al. 2014 (Sankararaman et al. , 2016 . Further, Neanderthal Y chromosome sequence has not been discovered in contemporary human genomes (Mendez et al. 2016) . These findings imply that X and Y chromosomal regions may have been involved in reproductive isolation during the time of hybridization, and thus, archaic ancestry was rapidly purged by selection acting on unfit hybrids, limiting introgression on sex chromosomes. In hybrid flies and mice, loci underlying hybrid male sterility disproportionately map to the X chromosome, consistent with a large role of the X chromosome in speciation (e.g., Presgraves 2008; Turner and Harr 2014) .",

We address this here by identifying genomic regions that are consistent with the signature of reproductive isolation (i.e., \"barrier loci\") between 2 contemporary primate species that form a natural hybrid zone and ask whether deserts of archaic ancestry on the human X chromosome are unique to hominids or shared with other primates. Natural hybrid zones offer unique opportunities to identify barrier loci because reproductive isolation between the parental taxa is still incomplete. In hybrid zones, novel combinations of alleles in hybrids are tested by selection (Dobzhanksy 1936; Muller 1942) . Recombination shuffles composite genomes with many generations of backcrossing, and loci that underlie reproductive isolation are expected to have restricted introgression as a result of selection against unfit hybrids carrying incompatible alleles, while neutral and adaptive alleles are free to introgress between species ( Barton and Hewitt 1985; Gompert and Buerkle 2011) .",

A genome assembly was recently developed for A. palliata, opening the possibility for detailed investigation of fine-scale variation contributing to reproductive isolation and other evolutionary processes. Further, the Alouatta system is the first contemporary primate system in which the genomic architecture of reproductive isolation has been investigated (Baiz et al. 2019; Cort\u00e9s-Ortiz et al. 2019) , thus due to its relatively close phylogenetic proximity, it serves as a model that may yield insight to processes responsible for generating similar patterns observed in human genomes.",

To do this, we downloaded the masked version of each assembly from the University of California Santa Cruz Genome Browser and used a custom script (available at https://github.com/ baizm/Xchr_introgression) to remove scaffolds that have not yet been assigned to any chromosome (i.e., sequences with a header containing \"chrUn\").

To assess the ability of our method to detect X-linked sequence, we also aligned a set of 2,288 unbiased, likely autosomal contigs for comparison (i.e., the same as the number of female-biased contigs), randomly chosen from the list of contigs that did not have a significant difference in read counts between the sexes.",

Because the X chromosome is hemizygous in males and X-linked SNPs will appear to be homozygous, biasing genomic cline estimates, we only included sequence data from female individuals in genomic cline analyses to avoid bias in our X chromosomeautosome comparison of differential introgression. This included 88 female individuals, 48 of which were sampled from the hybrid zone in Tabasco, Mexico, 17 from the allopatric range of A. palliata and 23 from the allopatric range of A. pigra (Figure 1 ), which we A. palliata A. pigra Non\u2212admixed populations Hybrid zone population included in our genomic cline analysis. All allopatric individuals included here have been previously shown to be non-admixed (Baiz et al. 2019) . We used double digest restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (ddRADseq, Peterson et al. 2012) to generate reducedrepresentation genome sequence data for these individuals, as described in Baiz et al. (2019) . We retained only biallelic SNPs with a minor allele frequency of at least 0.05, a minimum mean read depth of 12 across all individuals, and sites present in 14 or more individuals in either parental population. To reduce the effects of linkage among markers, and because previous analyses indicated that SNPs on the same Alouatta contig generally show consistent patterns of introgression (Baiz et al. 2019) , we retained only 1 SNP at random per contig. This resulted in 10 353 SNPs used in the genomic cline analysis. The combined length of the Alouatta contigs containing SNPs used in our analysis represents ~39% of the A. palliata genome assembly. We considered X-linked SNPs to be those on female-biased contigs that mapped to the marmoset X chromosome (N SNPs = 97) and autosomal SNPs to be those on contigs that had no significant difference in read counts between the sexes (N SNPs = 10 256). The set of X-linked and autosomal SNPs represent approximately equal genotyping densities on female-biased (1.9 \u00d7 10 -5 SNPs/Mb) and unbiased contigs (8.4 \u00d7 10 -6 SNPs/Mb).

This analysis uses Markov chain Monte Carlo to estimate cline parameters in a Bayesian genomic cline model and identify outlier loci that are more or less likely than the genome-wide average (assumed to be neutral) to introgress between parental populations. Two cline parameters are used to summarize the amount (\u03b2) and direction (\u03b1) of introgression. Loci associated with reproductive isolation are expected to have reduced introgression (\u03b2 > 0), while loci with increased introgression (\u03b2 < 0) may be candidates for adaptive introgression. Loci with a shift in cline center reflect directional movement of alleles into A. palliata (excess A. pigra ancestry, \u03b1 > 0) or movement into A. pigra (excess A. palliata ancestry, \u03b1 < 0).",

Of these contigs, 811 (75.3%) mapped to the marmoset X chromosome, 277 (25.7%) mapped to marmoset autosomes, and 1 mapped to the marmoset Y chromosome. This enrichment of hits to the marmoset X chromosome is consistent with the results of our comparative read count analysis (see above), indicating that these regions are likely to be X-linked in A. palliata. Comparatively, a much smaller proportion of the unbiased contigs (3.4%) and male-biased contigs (1.1%) mapped to the marmoset X chromosome while the majority mapped to autosomes (Supplementary Figure S2) . Further, log 2 FC for the subset of the 811 female-biased contigs that mapped to the marmoset X chromosome was less variable and closer to the expected \u22121 for X-linked sequences compared to the larger pool of 2288 female-biased contigs (Supplementary Figure S4) .

To explore this, we looked at the mapping positions of the 277 female-biased contigs that mapped to marmoset autosomes and compared them to the mapping positions of male-biased and unbiased contigs for the autosomes with the most hits. After the X chromosome, chromosome 7 had the highest number of hits for female-biased contigs (Supplementary Figure S5A ). However, chromosome 7 also had the highest number of hits for both male-biased and unbiased contigs (Supplementary Figure S5A) , and for all contig types, the hits were clustered around positions 29.6 MB and 74.3 MB (Supplementary Figure S5B) . Similarly, chromosome 21 had the third highest number of hits for female-biased contigs, high mapping numbers for male-biased and unbiased contigs, and a clustering of mapping positions around 17.7 MB (Supplementary Figure S5C) . These mapping positions are not unique to sex-biased contigs, which may be due to multiple factors, including misassembly. This may also indicate that these sequences are not unique to the sex chromosomes.

We also expect that our dataset is an underrepresentation of the X chromosome given that much of the genome is repetitive, and we limited our analyses to non-repetitive sequences. Nonetheless, assuming the size of the A. palliata X chromosome is similar to the human and marmoset X chromosome and considering only the non-masked proportion of the human and marmoset X-chromosomal sequence (~59 Mb and ~57 Mb, respectively), the A. palliata sequences we identified to be X-linked here likely represent ~45% of the expected size of the non-masked A. palliata X chromosome.

This is in contrast, however, to the high frequency of chromosomal rearrangements that have occurred in neotropical primates (Wienberg and Stanyon 1998; M\u00fcller 2006; de Oliviera et al. 2012) and suggests that despite the propensity for chromosomal rearrangements within Alouatta, including an autosome-Y translocation in A. palliata that forms a trivalent sex chromosome system (Solari and Rahn 2005; Steinberg et al. 2014) , selection for conservation of the X chromosome in A. palliata may remain strong. Cytomolecular studies suggest the autosome-Y translocation is shared with A. pigra (Steinberg et al. 2014) , but that A. pigra independently evolved an additional translocation (Steinberg et al. 2008) , resulting in a quadrivalent sex chromosome system.

This pattern would be expected for autosomal regions that have been translocated from autosomes to the X chromosome in Alouatta. However, mapping positions for these contigs were shared and also common among male-biased and unbiased contigs. Thus, it is more likely that these regions are not unique to the X chromosome and represent false positives in our mapping experiment, or they represent marmoset X-chromosomal sequences that were erroneously mapped to autosomes.

For example, the presence of locally adapted alleles, which can accumulate more rapidly on the X chromosome than on autosomes (Charlesworth et al. 1987) , would be expected to slow introgression of the X chromosome. Further, because the majority of the X chromosome only recombines in females, it has a reduced rate of recombination relative to autosomes (Schaffner 2004; Bohmanova et al. 2010) , amplifying the effects of linkage around any adaptive alleles or barrier locus. Also, because males lack a second copy, the X chromosome has a relatively low effective population size (3/4 that of autosomes), making genetic drift more efficient and leading to reduced diversity and increased differentiation (Schaffner 2004) . The effects of these factors are not expected to be mutually exclusive, and patterns of introgression do vary as a function of recombination rate and differentiation Janou\u0161ek et al. 2015; Baiz et al. 2019 ). Because we do not have direct evidence linking specific loci to reproductive isolation mechanisms, we acknowledge that our finding of reduced introgression of sex chromosome markers in this system is indirect evidence for X-linked reproductive isolation (Presgraves 2018) .",

Sankararaman et al. (2016) hypothesized that hominin hybrid males suffered from reduced fertility because deserts of archaic ancestry on the human X chromosome are especially enriched near genes expressed in the testis. Because our region 3 outlier mapped to the central portion of one of these deserts, which spans a large section of the human X chromosome (34 Mb), we hypothesize that this window includes a region that underlies postzygotic reproductive isolation in both systems and thus may be important to the genetic architecture of speciation in primates. To further address this question, it will be highly informative to compare these observations to those from other primate systems. To our knowledge, the Alouatta system is the only natural non-human primate hybrid zone system that has been used specifically to identify genomic regions with candidate barrier loci. However, there are many known and genetically confirmed primate hybrid zone systems that could be used to similar ends (e.g., marmosets: Malukiewicz et al. 2015; chimpanzees: de Manuel et al. 2016; baboons: Wall et al. 2016; South American howlers: Mourthe et al. 2018) . A recent study detected historical introgressive hybridization between bonobos and chimpanzees and found that gene exchange was restricted on the X chromosome (de Manuel et al. 2016) . However, the authors did not report whether any X-linked regions were more or less resistant to introgression. Future studies on the genetics of hybridization and speciation in primates reporting such detail will allow for comparisons across studies and to address the hypothesis that a shared genetic architecture of reproductive isolation underlies speciation in primates.",

                "text": "In addition to a signature of reduced introgression, we found that X-linked SNPs tended to have excess ancestry from A. palliata more so than from A. pigra. Asymmetry in the direction of X chromosome introgression could be explained by a bias in the direction of backcrossing due to an unequal abundance of parental types in the hybrid zone or to directionality in prezygotic reproductive barriers (i.e., if hybrids carrying the A. palliata X chromosome are more likely to backcross with A. pigra, or A. pigra-like hybrids). Extensive sampling in this system has shown that both parental types, as well as multigenerational backcrossed hybrids into both parental types are relatively equally abundant (Kelaita and Cort\u00e9s-Ortiz 2013; Cort\u00e9s-Ortiz et al. 2019 ), suggesting that asymmetry in the direction of introgression is not caused by differences in abundance. If A. pigra males have traits more preferable to F1 females, then prezygotic barriers could explain the bias in X chromosome introgression. However, this is not consistent with the relatively equal abundance of backcrossed hybrid types, which indicates backcrossing occurs in both directions. Further, such bias due to the direction of backcrossing would be expected to carry over to autosomal loci. We found that autosomal loci do show asymmetry in the direction of introgression, but in the opposite direction-autosomal loci are enriched for A. pigra ancestry (Table 3 , Supplementary Figure S6) . Thus, these results may indicate that for the X chromosome, A. palliata alleles may be more favorable than A. pigra alleles in the hybrid zone when they do pass the species boundary, or that A. pigra alleles are less favorable in the habitat or genomic background of A. palliata. Outlier region 1 is particularly gene-rich (Table 4, Supplementary Table  S3 ) and contains genes with varied functions, including functions related to the immune system (e.g., FOXP3, WAS, CFP), neuron function (e.g., ELK1, SYN1, SYP), and gene regulation (FOXP3, SSX1/SSX4B, UXT).",

This is consistent with anecdotal evidence for hybrid male sterility in this system. Further, hybrid X chromosomes also exhibit an excess of A. palliata ancestry-a pattern that is opposite to autosomes, which exhibit an excess of A. pigra ancestry. Together, our results suggest that selection may be shaping introgression of the X chromosome and autosomes in different ways. Finally, one X-chromosomal region with significantly reduced levels of introgression overlaps a region of reduced archaic ancestry in the human genome, which suggests a shared genomic architecture of reproductive isolation in primates.",
