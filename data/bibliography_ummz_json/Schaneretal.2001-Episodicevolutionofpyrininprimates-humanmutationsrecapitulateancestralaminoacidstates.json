    "abstract": "Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF; MIM 249100) is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by recurrent attacks of fever with synovial, pleural or peritoneal inflammation 1. The disease is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the pyrin protein 2-4. Human population studies have revealed extremely high allele frequencies for several different pyrin mutations, leading to the conclusion that the mutant alleles confer a selective advantage 5-7. Here we examine the ret finger protein (rfp) domain (which contains most of the disease-causing mutations) of pyrin during primate evolution. Amino acids that cause human disease are often present as wild type in other species. This is true at positions 653 (a novel mutation), 680, 681, 726, 744 and 761. For several of these human mutations, the mutant represents the reappearance of an ancestral amino acid state. Examination of lineage-specific d N /d S ratios revealed a pattern consistent with the signature of episodic positive selection. Our data, together with previous human population studies, indicate that selective pressures may have caused functional evolution of pyrin in humans and other primates.",

We focused on the rfp domain because it contains most reported FMF mutations, and mutations in this domain may have been under selective pressure in humans. We sequenced the rfp domain from 20 primates, as well as 2 non-primate mammals (Fig. 1) . A priori, we expected that the amino acids known to be important for pyrin function (that is, residues at which disease-causing mutations occur) would be highly conserved. But this was not the case. Of the ten amino acid positions where a mutation results in FMF, only one (M694) was absolutely conserved.",

In fact, at seven of these positions (653, 680, 681, 692, 726, 744 and 761), the human mutant residues are observed as wild type in primate and/or non-primate sequences. Although their pyrin genes contain one or more 'mutant' amino acids at these positions, these species are presumably not suffering from FMF-like illnesses. Because the disease phenotype indicates that these amino acids are of functional importance in humans, this implies one of the following: (i) pyrin may have a qualitatively identical function in all species, but the variant residues may quantitatively increase or decrease this function, perhaps providing a differential selective advantage to different species; or (ii) pyrin may have a novel function in organisms that have different amino acids at these positions. Although discrimination between these possibilities necessitates an assay for the function of pyrin, this data set presents a unique opportunity to examine the evolutionary history of these disease-causing amino acids. Consequently, we . Boxes highlight regions in which a human FMF mutation is wild type in non-human primates and/or nonprimate mammals. We also sequenced and aligned representative introns upstream of exon 10 to assure orthology (data not shown). Extensive sequencing of human [2] [3] [4] [5] [20] [21] [22] and primate MEFV has revealed no evidence for gene duplication in any species studied. Rat and mouse sequences are not shown because both species contain a frameshift mutation at the beginning of exon 10, creating a stop codon after the first few amino acids 23 . used a computational algorithm to delineate the most parsimonious reconstruction of amino acid change using a total evidence primate phylogeny 11, 12 (Fig. 2 ). We carried out this analysis at position 653 (this is the first report of this mutation, a G\u2192A transition at nt 1,958 that changes arginine to histidine; Fig. 2a ). The human wild-type amino acid, arginine, is seen only in gorilla, chimp and human. All other species (except dwarf lemur) contain histidine at this position. Thus, histidine is most likely the ancestral amino acid, and the human disease mutation from arginine to histidine replicates this ancestral (and highly conserved) state. A similar kind of pattern is seen in the evolutionary history of positions 726 ( Fig.  2b) , 744 ( Fig. 2c ) and 761 ( Fig.  2d) . Although it is possible that variation at all of these positions is due to relaxed functional constraint, it is clear that in humans the recurrence of these ancestral states has functional consequences. Thus, the disease data, superimposed on the evolutionary history of these amino acid sites, indicate an alternative hypothesis: that the function of pyrin is being modified or modulated over evolutionary time.",

Although some of these lineages display values close to 1.0, which would theoretically be the neutral expectation, it is important to note that these are conservative tests of selection 14, 15 . The models used to assess selection allow d N /d S ratios to vary along branches of the phylogeny, but not between amino acid positions within each sequence. Thus, these ratios represent an average across all amino acids in the sequence, and thereby dilute the signal of selection 14, 15 . As single amino acid mutations result in FMF, and as some of these mutations seem to be selected for in human populations, it is highly probable that selection is acting at the single amino acid level. The combination of positively selected bursts of change followed by purifying selection is also consistent with a change in function followed by the fixation of that change in the population. Such a pattern is evident in this analysis; for example, following a high d N /d S value in branch B (1.06), the highest d N /d S value is 0.54 (and all others are 0). If pyrin is indeed integral to the response of neutrophils to an exogenous insult, as hypothesized 2 , it is noteworthy that several of the branch points exhibiting d N /d S ratios greater than 1.0 define cladogenic events fundamental to primate evolution. A previous analysis of catarrhines during evolution indicates that the common ancestor of gorillas, chimps and humans migrated from Asia back into Africa 16 . The lineage (Fig. 3, B ) along which this migration occurred has a d N /d S ratio suggestive of positive darwinian selection. It is striking that two of the human mutant residues (744 and 653) change character state during evolution precisely along branch B (Fig. 2) . For position 653, this change is the reverse (H653R) of the human mutation. The disease phenotype of the human mutations indicates that these non-synonymous changes on branch B may be functionally significant. It is possible that novel environmental pathogens would have been encountered during this migratory event, prompting positive selection of an altered function for pyrin.",

Moreover, as human mutations are often found as reversals to an ancestral state, the evolutionary history at those positions likely represents evolution of function. Although FMF seems to be a predominantly recessive disease from a classical genetic perspective, these data predict that FMF mutations serve to alter rather than destroy pyrin function. Recent findings, including detection of an abnormal phenotype in heterozygotes and genetic studies indi-cating variably penetrant dominant inheritance, fit well with this hypothesis 6, 17 . It is possible that pyrin interacts directly with pathogens or with molecules of the host defense system; such interactions might explain the mutations as counter-evolutionary changes selected to cope with a changing pathogen. Sporadic interactions between pyrin and such pathogens could explain the episodic nature of FMF inflammatory attacks.",

We used the program PAML to apply two models of nucleotide sequence evolution to our data set, the 'free ratio' model (in which d N /d S ratios are allowed to vary among lineages) and the 'simple' model (in which one d N /d S ratio is assumed to hold for all lineages) 14, 19 . Given our data set and phylogeny, the fit of these different hypotheses (that is, nested models that vary d N and d S parameters) to the data can be statistically compared using the likelihood ratio test. The P value (P=0.001) indicates that the free ratio model fits our data significantly better than the simple model. We estimated branch lengths and the transition/transversion ratio from the data by maximum likelihood. We used a total evidence phylogeny to represent the accepted phylogeny of these primates 12 . It is important to note that using secondary tests of the data to further assess the significance of d N /d S ratios estimated to be greater than one (by means of the free ratio model) biases the significance of the outcomes of secondary tests when there is no a priori reason to suspect any particular lineage to be under selection 14, 19 . Because this is the case here, further tests to examine selection on individual lineages are not presented. We note, however, that the estimates of d N /d S ratios among Fig. 3 Maximum likelihood analysis using the 'free ratio' model. d N /d S ratios (number of non-synonymous changes per non-synonymous site/number of synonymous changes per synonymous site) are given below the lineages. Numbers of non-synonymous/synonymous changes are given above the lineages. A and B denote specific lineages that are discussed in the text. Some lineages have undergone only non-synonymous changes (\u221e), whereas one (dwarf lemur) has undergone a large number of non-synonymous (26.4) relative to synonymous (9.2) changes. Analyses were done using PAML (ref. 19) . Reconstructed sequences (derived from the free-ratio analysis) and/or extant sequences for the two nodes defining a lineage were compared to assess saturation of synonymous changes. Pairwise comparisons of third position transitions between all organisms indicate no saturation of synonymous changes (data not shown).",
