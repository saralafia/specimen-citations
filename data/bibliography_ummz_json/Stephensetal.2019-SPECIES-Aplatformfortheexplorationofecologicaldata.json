                "text": "A fundamental goal of ecology is to understand, model, and quantify ecological associations, some of which may represent ecological interactions, both biotic and abiotic, at different geographical and temporal scales (Kissling et al., 2012; Wisz et al., 2013) . Two important, associated conceptual frameworks are that of niche and community, where both biotic and abiotic factors play important roles, for instance, in defining the niche of a taxon (Sober\u00f3n, 2007) and its geographic distribution. However, it has been a challenge to incorporate both types of factor into distribution modeling (Ara\u00fajo & Luoto, 2007; Kissling et al., 2012) . Most progress has been made using environmental layers and different statistical models (Qiao, Sober\u00f3n, & Peterson, 2015; Vaz, Cunha, & Nabout, 2015) to map the relationship between them and an output variable, such as the propensity for the presence of a given species. In terms of community, one of the most popular representations is as a network, such as a food web (Pimm, Lawton, & Cohen, 1991) . Such networks normally represent only known direct ecological interactions (V\u00e1zquez, Morris, & Jordano, 2005) , such as predation (Ives & Carpenter, 2007) , as opposed to more indirect interactions, such as facilitation (Valiente-Banuet & Verd\u00fa, 2007) . SPECIES uses both perspectives, the niche and network perspectives, to explore associations found in the data between groups of species and/or abiotic spatial features. In this way, the analyst can focus on any subset of potential associations of interest to examine which ones have a ready known or plausible ecological interpretation and also what that interpretation may be.",

Even under the assumption that all potential pairwise interactions were observable, the number of associations that we would have to check grows quadratically with the number of species present in an area. For example, in the SNIB database, if we use cells with 8 km per side, we obtain some cells with the presence of more than a thousand animal species. If we add plants, then we get cells with more than 3,000 species. That is, we would have to study, respectively, more than 499,500 and 4,498,500 associations, some of which do, or could, represent pairwise interactions.",

However, as we do not have an a priori understanding of all the potential biotic relations that are worth investigating, the question then arises: Can we reduce the search space using proxy data, such as occurrence data? The general approach of using occurrence data to potentially characterize ecological interactions has a long history and is still a theme of debate (Bell, 2005; Connor & Simberloff, 1979 , 1983 Diamond, ; Gilpin & Diamond, 1982; Hubbell, ; Simberloff & Connor, 1984; Ulrich, Almeida-Neto, & Gotelli, 2009; Ulrich et al., 2017) . In the case of biotic factors, its quantification has been chiefly associated with the analysis of presence-absence matrices (Arita, Christen, Rodr\u00edguez, & Sober\u00f3n, 2012; Gaston, Chown, & Evans, 2008) . In the case of abiotic interactions, standard distribution modeling (Ara\u00fajo & Guisan, 2006; Rangel & Loyola, 2012) is an attempt to do this. However, a theoretical and computational framework in which both biotic and abiotic factors of arbitrary spatial resolution may be integrated at both the niche and community levels has been, until recently, lacking.",

Partitioning \ue23e into a grid, \ue233 with N cells, we obtain a collection of N sites, c i , i = 1, \u2026 ,N . In the current version, SPECIES 1.0, we use uniform, rectangular grids of 8, 16, 32, and 64 km per cell side. For Boolean spatial variables, the mapping from \ue23e to \ue233 is straightforward: Let c i be a site, we then define X such that X = 1 if c i contains a point where X = 1 and zero otherwise. To treat all variables on the same footing, we transform any non-Boolean variable into a discrete set of Boolean variables by dividing its range into a number of discrete intervals. In the current version, each such variable is divided into 10 such intervals (deciles). Importantly, it is this mapping which brings all variables to the same spatial resolution, as defined by \ue233. For example, if we have a real-valued variable X , such as \"Annual Mean Temperature,\" since in SPECIES 1.0, the principal mapping is \"presence/no presence\", 1 X is discretized by splitting it into ten \"presence/no presence\" variables X 1 , \u2026 X 10 . This means that for an environmental layer, if there are pixels in a cell (site) corresponding to a particular range/bin, then the cell contains a \"presence\" of that variable range. Analogously, we could extend this logic from a spatial region to a spatio-temporal region, \ue23e \u00d7 \ue240 . Note that, although converting all variables to Boolean type allows for a fair comparison of all variables, independent of their spatial resolution, in the discretization process, some information may be lost due to the coarse graining. This can, of course, be reduced by considering more bins, as long as in each bin there are enough data points. The result of this process can be easily conceptualized as a big presence-absence matrix (PAM), a familiar analytical tool in macroecology and biogeography (Arita et al., 2012; McCoy & Heck, 1987) . The distinction with standard PAMs (which are species \u00d7 locations matrices) is that in SPECIES, rows represent species and any other type of \"presence/no presence\" variable, and columns are grid cells.",

In particular, to include in data from large international datasets such as GBIF. Although data issues can lead to erroneous conclusions, the SPECIES platform itself facilitates the detection of anomalous points and/or data which can then be checked by hand.Another important area is the inclusion of more bespoke datasets from individual researchers or groups. As the philosophy of SPECIES is to integrate data from distinct data sources within a central modeling platform, rather than distribute a software to potential users, we plan to form a community of users such that the inclusion of their data can also leverage the large public datasets already present.
