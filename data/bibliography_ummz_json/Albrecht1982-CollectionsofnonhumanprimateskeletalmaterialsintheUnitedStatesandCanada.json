However, those responding to the survey often provided no indication as t o whether the reported numbers represent wildcaught specimens only, a mixture of wildcaught and captive specimens, or captive specimens only; these instances are annotated accordingly.

Napier and Napier (1967) was used as the standard for taxonomy and nomenclature because it covers all primates and is widely available; such usage was a matter of convenience and not necessarily endorsement. The number of genera presented herein is reduced to 50 because of the exclusion of Homo and the inclusion of Cynopithecus with Macaca (see Fooden, 1969; and Albrecht, 1978) ; addi-tionally, the generic name used by Napier and Napier (1967) for the lion-tamarins (Leontideus) is herein replaced by Leontopithecus (see Napier, 1976; and Hershkovitz, 1977) .

A total of 824 inquiries were mailed and 565 responses were received; by including 65 institutions that responded only to previous surveys, the number of institutions that possess mammal collections totals 388 (384 in the United States and Canada). The total mammalian holdings reported by United States and Canadian institutions approximated 2,521,000 specimens in 1973 (includes all types of specimens such as skins, fluidpreserved animals, and skeletons). By comparison to this number, responses to the primate survey were received from institutions that account for 87% of the mammalian holdings. Responses were received from 32 of the 37 institutions in the United States and Canada that have mammal collections exceeding 10,000 specimens (questionnaires were not sent to two of these institutions); additionally, 102 responses were received from those institutions with mammal collections of less than 10,000 specimens. Twenty-two other institutions which responded to the primate survey were not included in the mammal survey Note that many institutions included in the mammal survey have collections limited to regional faunas of North America; these institutions were not included in the primate survey because of the small probability of a positive response with respect to wild-caught primates.",
