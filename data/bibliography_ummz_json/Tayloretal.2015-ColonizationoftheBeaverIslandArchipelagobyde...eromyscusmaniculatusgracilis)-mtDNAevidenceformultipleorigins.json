    "abstract": "The Beaver Island group in Lake Michigan comprises nine islands ranging from 0.3 to 144 km 2 , lying approximately 30 km west of Michigan's Lower Peninsula (LP) and 15 km south of the Upper Peninsula (UP). The islands have been isolated from mainland Michigan for most of their postglacial history, but were connected to the mainland LP during the low-water Chippewa stage (ending about 7400 years before present (YBP)). Although plants and animals could have colonized the islands during the Chippewa period, flooding during the subsequent Nipissing high-water stand means that the smaller islands have been colonized more recently. We analyzed 481 bp of mitochondrial D-loop sequences from woodland deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus (Wagner, 1845)) on six of these islands in northern Lake Michigan to elucidate the mainland origin and minimum number of colonization events for this species. Surprisingly, the distribution of haplotypes on the islands suggests that the populations on most islands likely had separate recent origins on the mainland UP. Approximate Bayesian computation supports a scenario in which individual islands were colonized separately by distinct groups of mice. Together, the data suggest multiple colonization events from the UP, rather than expansion from a bottlenecked population or a single colonization event.",

                "text": "The shallow northern basin of Lake Michigan contains an archipelago of nine islands ranging in area from 0.3 to 144 km 2 , as well as several smaller islands (<0.3 km 2 ). The islands are arranged in a cluster around the largest in the group, Beaver Island ( Fig. 1 ). These islands likely emerged following the glacial retreat over 10 000 years before present (YBP) that created Lake Algonquin, the precursor to today's Lake Michigan (Evenson and Dreimanis 1976; Fisher and Whitman 1999) . Because the Beaver Island group is located over 15 km from the Upper Peninsula (UP) of Michigan, and over 30 km from the Lower Peninsula (LP), the mechanisms by which terrestrial organisms colonized these islands over the last few thousand years have been studied in a variety of taxa. Hatt et al. (1948) suggested that animals could have colonized the islands via a land bridge during the low-water Chippewa stage (9900-7400 YBP), when the northern basin was largely empty and the islands were probably connected to the LP but not the UP. Studies of tree pollen (Kapp et al. 1969) and of reptiles and amphibians (Bowen and Gillingham 2004) support the idea that the islands were directly colonized by these and other species during this period of connectivity to the LP. However, recent data indi-cate that Garter Snakes (Thamnophis sirtalis (L., 1758)) and woodland deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus gracilis (Le Conte, 1855)) on some of the islands are more closely related to populations on the UP than to those on the LP (Meagher 1999; Placyk et al. 2007; Hoffman 2010, 2012) . For some species, therefore, the data do not support the hypothesis that they colonized the islands via a land bridge from the LP.",

A single founding event could have established populations that then radiated throughout the island group. The Nipissing high-water stage, however, submerged most of the islands from about 7000 to 4500 YBP (Larsen 1985) , presumably extirpating their faunas. Only a few of the larger islands were left as possible refuges and any species sheltering there would suffer from genetic bottlenecks. Either a single founding event or a subsequent bottleneck during the high-water stage would be expected to produce modern populations containing a small number of very closely related haplotypes across all islands. By contrast, a large number of founding events originating from a diverse source population would produce populations with a relatively wide range of unrelated haplotypes on different islands. Here, we test for these scenarios with a population-level analysis of 481 bp of the mitochondrial control region from P. m. gracilis populations on six islands in the Beaver Island Archipelago.",

ABC is a simulation-based method for evaluating colonization scenarios based on summary statistics. Population data sets were simulated based on user-defined colonization scenarios and the summary statistics from those data sets were then compared with the observed data (Cornuet et al. 2008) . We constructed four scenarios describing the colonization of the islands from the UP (Fig. 3) . In all scenarios, all populations were sampled in the present (time 0). In scenario 1, all island populations (labeled N3-N6) diverged from an ancestral Beaver Island population (N3) at a relatively recent time (t1) in the past; the UP, LP, and ancestral island populations diverged at a more distant time in the past (t2). Scenario 2 is identical to scenario 1, except that it postulates a bottleneck in the ancestral island population (N3) at time t2-db. In scenario 3, island populations separated from the UP (N1) at a recent time (t1); the UP and LP (N2) diverged at a more distant time in the past (t2), after which the LP experienced a bottleneck (at time t2-db). Scenario 4 is similar to scenario 3, except that it postulates a shared ancestry for the Beaver Island (N3) and Hog Island (N5) populations, but separate colonization of the other islands from the UP (N1). We did not include any models in which the LP was colonized after the islands, because DIY-ABC could not reconcile the phylogeny with those scenarios. We also used a preliminary examination of haplotype distributions (Fig. 2) to determine whether islands were colonized in groups (Hog Island with Beaver Island, and others independently); these groupings were incorporated into scenario 4. All scenarios assumed that the UP was the source of all populations, based on data presented elsewhere Hoffman 2010, 2012) .

In addition, the private haplotype BA2 provides the only likely example of in situ mutation; this haplotype appears to be an immediate derivative of another haplotype found on the same island, although the possibility remains that it represents an unsampled mainland haplotype. We conclude that only the Beaver Island mice show any genetic evidence of a large sustained population size and possible pre-Nipissing origins. Our results are consistent with the greater allozyme heterozygosity in Beaver Island mouse populations compared with those on other islands (Meagher 1999) . These studies of deer mice are also consistent with Garter Snake mitochondrial haplotype richness (Placyk et al. 2007) , which showed its highest diversity levels on Beaver Island.",

However, our results suggest that, while Beaver Island populations may be relics of a pre-Nipissing colonization, they are not the likely source of the populations on the nearby islands. The smaller islands were probably colonized directly from the UP, as indicated by the distribution of mitochondrial haplotypes and by our ABC analyses. The history and landscape of the region suggest that these colonization events would likely have occurred after the Nipissing stage, when the smaller islands had recovered sufficient area to support lasting mouse populations. If accomplished via natural over-water processes, this represents an impressive series of dispersal events for such a small terrestrial animal. Paleontological and further archeological data would be invaluable for timing the arrival of this and other animals to the islands and for evaluating the alternative possibility of human-mediated colonization.",
