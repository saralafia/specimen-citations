    "abstract": "We describe a partial skeleton of a new species of Bubalus (Bubalus) from soft karst near Balamban, Cebu Island, Philippines. The specimen is likely Pleistocene or Holocene in age and includes left and right humeri, a left metatarsal, 2 posterior thoracic vertebrae, 2 left lower molars, and a pair of ungual phalanges. Bubalus sp. nov. differs from all previously described Bubalus in both the size and proportions of the skeleton and in possessing a unique combination of discrete character states. Possible autapomorphies for Bubalus sp. nov. evident in the metatarsal include a very broad dorsal longitudinal sulcus; a broad, triangular anterior cubonavicular facet; and a sulcus that bisects a small tuberosity on the proximolateral surface. Limb elements of Bubalus sp. nov. are less than two-thirds the length of corresponding elements of the Asiatic water buffalo, B. (Bubalus) bubalis, and are about 80% the length of those of the tamaraw, B. (Bubalus) mindorensis; they are similar in length to limb bones of the lowland anoa, B. (Anoa) depressicornis, but are more robust. Mass estimates based on regression equations for modern bovids suggests a mass of 150-165 kg for Bubalus sp. nov.; this is approximately 25% smaller than B. mindorensis (180-220 kg) and at least 15% larger than B. depressicornis (approximately 135 kg). The small size of Bubalus sp. nov. relative to other B. (Bubalus) is likely attributable to island dwarfing; this is supported by a consistent relationship between body size and island size in Bubalus sp. nov., B. mindorensis, and B. bubalis, and by the relatively larger dentition of B. sp. nov. relative to body size. Bubalus sp. nov. is the 1st fossil mammal to be reported from Cebu Island and is the only nonproboscidean documented from the Negros-Panay Philippine Faunal Region. In conjunction with the presence of Bubalus on Mindoro Island (and potentially Luzon), this specimen suggests that Bubalus may once have ranged throughout the Philippines.",

At least 172 species of native mammals have been recorded, of which 111 (64%) are endemic . This degree of endemism is exceeded only by Madagascar, an island of nearly twice the total area; on a per-area basis, the Philippines may harbor the greatest number of endemic mammals in the world (Heaney 1993 ). Because of this endemism, the Philippines has been recognized both as one of the most ''megadiverse'' countries and as one of the ''hottest'' biological hotspots, making it a top priority for conservation efforts (Ricketts et al. 2005; Shi et al. 2005) . Newly discovered mammals continue to be described from the region (e.g., Rickart et al. 2002 Rickart et al. , 2003 Rickart et al. , 2005 , indicating that the true species richness of the country is still unknown.",

Such investigations have been aided by the recognition that the present configuration of islands is a geologically recent event. During the last glacial maximum of the late Pleistocene (approximately 20,000 years ago), the great quantity of water trapped in polar and continental ice sheets lowered sea levels worldwide, exposing areas of land that had previously been submerged (e.g., Bird et al. 2005; Meijaard 2003 ). In the Philippines, these exposed areas connected many previously isolated islands, resulting in 6 major Philippine faunal regions (Heaney 1991; ; Fig. 1 ). Although these islands once again became isolated after the Pleistocene, disparities in faunal resemblance between intraregional and interregional island pairs are still dramatic (Heaney 1986; Heaney and Regalado 1998; and may differ from those that existed before that event.",

The fossil was found at the end of an approximately 10-to 11m horizontal tunnel that had been dug into the side of a ridge for the purpose of phosphate mining. The sediments in which the fossil was found likely represent fissure-fill (i.e., sediments that had accumulated within a crack or crevice in the limestone). All elements of the specimen were found on a single day, in close proximity to each other, within loose matrix. No other fossils were found at this site or in other similar mining tunnels dug in the vicinity.

The majority of these species are incompletely known, however, and are differentiated primarily by horn core characters (e.g., Geraads 1992; Xue and Li 2000; Young 1936 ). The new species described herein is represented by 2 teeth and various postcranial elements and therefore cannot be directly compared to most fossil taxa. Of necessity, therefore, the diagnosis below focuses on character states that distinguish the new Cebu Island species from extant species of Bubalus, the only taxa for which sufficient postcranial specimens are available for diagnostic differentiation. The new species can only be stated with certainty to differ from all fossil species of Bubalus by its dramatically smaller size.",

The most widespread of these is Bubalus bubalis, the Asiatic water buffalo; domestic B. bubalis is found virtually throughout the world (Kierstein et al. 2004) , but wild populations have declined and are considered endangered (Nowak 1999) . Water buffaloes are the largest Bubalus, with wild males weighing more than 1,000 kg (Popenoe 1983) . Some authorities distinguish between the wild and domestic forms, using the name B. arnee for the former and reserving B. bubalis for the latter (e.g., Geraads 1992; Groves 1969 ). We do not make this distinction in the present report because the 2 species cannot be readily distinguished from one another by anatomical differences. Bubalus mindorensis, the tamaraw or tamarau, is endemic to the Philippine island of Mindoro (Custodio et al. 1996) . It is much smaller than B. bubalis (see below) and is highly endangered because of a variety of factors, including hunting and habitat destruction (Heaney and Utzurrum 1991; Oliver 1993) . B. bubalis and B. mindorensis are generally grouped together in the subgenus Bubalus (Grubb 2005) . The subgenus Anoa includes 2 very similar species of dwarf buffalo endemic to Sulawesi, Indonesia: B. depressicornis, the lowland anoa, and B. quarlesi, the mountain anoa (Burton et al. 2005; Dolan 1965; Groves 1969) .

B. cebuensis is similar in size to members of the subgenus Anoa (within approx. 10% for limb element lengths), but its skeleton is much more robust. The humerus, metatarsal, and vertebrae differ noticeably from those of B. (Anoa) and display a mixture of characters shared with B. bubalis, B. mindorensis, or both (e.g., roughly spherical humeral head, large greater tuberosity on humerus, low and broad deltopectoral crest, elongate metatarsal relative to humerus, straight metatarsal in medial view, small posterior cubonavicular facet on articular surface of metatarsal, T9-11 spinous processes straight in lateral view, and mammillary processes absent on T9-11; Table 2 ). The relative width of the dorsal longitudinal sulcus on the metatarsal is greater than that exhibited by any modern Bubalus and may be an autapomorphy for the new species. The unusual configuration of the proximal end of the metatarsal (i.e., with a broad, triangular anterior cubonavicular facet on the articular surface and a sulcus that bisects a small tuberosity on the proximolateral surface) may also be autapomorphic for B. cebuensis.",

As in other Bubalus, the greater tubercle in B. cebuensis projects far above the humeral head and arches medially over the intertubercular groove, creating a tunnel. The greater tubercle is much larger and more developed in B. cebuensis, B. mindorensis, and B. bubalis compared to B. depressicornis. A well-defined pit is present in the tubercular fossa (i.e., the area anterior to the humeral head and medial to the base of the greater tubercle); this pit is absent in B. depressicornis and is present but less defined in B. mindorensis and B. bubalis. The greater tubercle extends inferiorly beyond the articular surface of the humeral head in B. cebuensis and B. bubalis; this contrasts with the condition in B. mindorensis, in which the greater tubercle ends at approximately the same level as the articular surface. A rugose deltopectoral crest is present in B. cebuensis, but the deltoid tuberosity is low and broad, strongly differing from the conditions observed in B. depressicornis (in which it is a thin, platelike process) and B. mindorensis (in which it is a high ridge). It resembles the condition in B. bubalis, but is less developed. The scar marking the insertion of the teres minor muscle is large and broad in B. cebuensis, again more closely resembling the condition in B. bubalis than in either B. depressicornis or B. mindorensis (in which it is narrow). B. cebuensis differs from both B. bubalis and B. mindorensis in having a smaller lesser tubercle and in having a lesspronounced medial ridge on the lesser tubercle for insertion of the subscapularis muscle.",

The factor loadings for PC1 and PC2 are presented in Table 4 and the specimens are plotted against these 2 factors in Fig. 4 . Again, PC1 clearly represents size (all variables have high positive loadings), but in contrast to the humeral results, B. cebuensis is positioned between B. depressicornis and B. mindorensis on this axis, reflecting the relatively larger size of the metatarsal in the new species compared to the humerus. PC2 represents metatarsal robustness to some degree-midshaft mediolateral diameter has a high positive loading and length has a high negative loading-but proximal and midshaft anteroposterior diameters also exhibit somewhat higher negative loadings. There is less discrimination along this axis than in the same axis in the principal component analysis of humeral measurements, reflecting a greater amount of individual or ontogenetic shape variation, or both, in the Bubalus metatarsal than in the humerus. Both B. mindorensis and B. bubalis vary greatly in their scores on PC2, but show surprisingly little overlap; B. cebuensis and B. depressicornis are within the range of variation of B. bubalis, distinct from B. mindorensis. Vertebrae.-Two thoracic vertebrae of B. cebuensis are preserved but they differ in several respects from thoracic vertebrae of modern Bubalus (Fig. 6) ; because of this, their precise positions within the thoracic series are uncertain. Both preserved vertebrae exhibit relatively small costal articular facets (both on the vertebral body and transverse process), which suggests they pertain to the caudal half of the thoracic region (i.e., T7-13). They differ from vertebrae in this region of B. depressicornis in being larger, more robust, and lacking well-developed mammillary processes on the dorsal surfaces of the transverse processes.

It compares reasonably well with T9 of B. mindorensis in having a spinous process that is long and straight and mediolaterally expanded at its distal end (although the epiphysis is not preserved in the fossil vertebra). The caudal articular facets are positioned at approximately the same angle as the spinous process (458) and are elliptical.

In this respect, it is more similar to T10 of B. mindorensis. The vertebra differs dramatically from both T9 and T10 of B. depressicornis; in those vertebrae, the spinous processes arch caudally (i.e., they are concave caudally) and the caudal costal facet is positioned more dorsally on the vertebral body than the cranial costal facet (they are at the same level in B. cebuensis).

The vertebra also exhibits a more vertical spinous process than typical T12 and T13 of modern Bubalus. It cannot represent T10, however, if the identification of the more complete vertebra described above is correct; when placed in approximate articulation, the 2 vertebrae do not appear to represent consecutive positions. The vertebra is more similar to T11 of B. mindorensis than of B. depressicornis, although the transverse processes are less well developed than in B. mindorensis. The vertebral body is very robust; it is intermediate in length between that of B. depressicornis and B. mindorensis, but is similar in breadth to the latter, making it relatively broader than in any modern material of Bubalus examined ( Table 5 ).

Given the greater similarity in size between B. cebuensis and B. (Anoa) than between the former and B. (Bubalus), the character states common to B. cebuensis and B.

Within B. (Bubalus), B. cebuensis shares more character states with B. bubalis than with B. mindorensis. The latter 2 species share several traits not observed in B. cebuensis, however, which may indicate a closer relationship between them than between either and B. cebuensis.

To test this assertion, we estimated the body mass of B. cebuensis using postcranial regression equations for modern bovids published by Scott (1983) . Eleven humeral and metatarsal measurements examined by Scott (1983) were preserved in the available material of B. cebuensis and 10 of these were used to estimate body mass; metatarsal length was excluded because it is poorly correlated with body mass in modern bovids (Scott 1983) . The remaining 10 variables produced mass estimates of approximately 115-215 kg with X \u00bc 157.2 kg and SD \u00bc 36.6 kg ( Table 7) . Humeral mass estimates exhibited a much greater range than metatarsal mass estimates, but the average values were quite similar (154.0 kg and 162.0 kg, respectively). A reasonable mass estimate for this particular specimen of B. cebuensis is roughly 150-165 kg. Given the variability in estimates derived from individual measurements in living taxa, this estimate is probably within 15% of the true mass of this fossil animal (Scott 1983) .",

In the case of rare ungulates such as B. mindorensis and B. (Anoa), even poor mass estimates are comparably scarce. Only 2 independent body masses have been published for B. mindorensis: Talbot and Talbot (1966) estimated the mass of a female zoo animal at 600 lb (\u00bc 275 kg) and Roth and Montemayor-Taca (1971) estimated the mass of a female zoo animal at 180-220 kg. Although sexual dimorphism is evident in the skull of B. mindorensis, body mass and limb proportions do not vary with sex (Custodio et al. 1996) , and so these estimates also should apply to male B. mindorensis. Using the regression equations of Scott (1983) , an average body mass of approximately 210 kg was obtained for the 2 male specimens examined in the present study; this accords well with the estimate of Roth and Montemayor-Taca (1971) and highlights the lack of sexual dimorphism in this species. Groves (1969) reported a body mass of 56 kg for an adult B. quarlesi and indicated it was the only body mass for B. (Anoa) that he was aware of; this same mass was used by Scott (1983) for B. depressicornis, presumably because no better data were available. Burton et al. (2005) estimated the body mass of B. quarlesi as ,150 kg, but provided no data for individual specimens; they estimated the body mass of B. depressicornis as ,300 kg, but noted that no specimen has ever been recorded at more than 150 kg. Based on skull length (Groves 1969) , there does not appear to be dramatic sexual size dimorphism in B. (Anoa). Using the regression equations of Scott (1983) , a body mass of approximately 135 kg was obtained for the single female specimen of B. (A.) depressicornis examined in the present study. Therefore, this suggests that a mass estimate of ,150 kg for B. depressicornis may be more accurate than an estimate of ,300 kg.",

In fact, the long fossil record of Bubalus in Asia suggests that both B. mindorensis and B. cebuensis may be dwarf forms of B. bubalis that arose by dispersal to and within the Philippines. Given the rarity of fossils in the Philippines and the lack of a secure phylogeny for the species of B. (Bubalus), details of such a scenario must remain provisional. However, certain independent aspects of the distribution and morphology of these taxa do support this general interpretation. Heaney (1978) examined body-size variation in the tricolored squirrel, Callosciurus prevostii, and found a significant correlation between body size and island size. Based on this correlation and patterns of variation in other mammals, he constructed a model predicting that the effects of food limitation, predation, and interspecific competition on body size would vary depending on the body size of the species in question and the area of the island. In some cases, these factors would be expected to produce insular dwarfs; in others, giants would result. For large mammals, food limitation was proposed as the most significant factor affecting insular body size, and a direct correlation between body size and island size was the expected result. In support of this model, Heaney (1978) noted such a correlation in Pleistocene populations of Elephas falconeri, where increasingly smaller-bodied taxa are found on progressively smaller Mediterranean islands (Maglio 1973) . Although this pattern may not apply to carnivorans (Heaney 1978; Meiri et al. 2004) or tree sloths (Anderson and Handley 2002) it does seem to be generally applicable to large ungulates, including Bubalus.",

No well-preserved Bubalus have been discovered on other islands that might permit testing of this scenario; although isolated teeth from Luzon have been referred to B. mindorensis (Beyer 1957) , they have not been critically examined (Custodio et al. 1996) , and probably are not useful for estimating body size in bovids except in very general terms (Scott 1983 ; see also below).Size reduction in insular dwarfs is not generally isometric across all parts of the body; allometric relationships have been noted both for the dentition (Fortelius 1985; Lister 1989 ) and distal limb elements (K\u00f6hler and Moy\u00e0-Sol\u00e0 2001; Sondaar 1977) , among other structures. In dentition, island dwarfs tend to have relatively larger teeth, an attribute apparently exhibited by B. cebuensis; although much less massive than B. mindorensis, the teeth of these 2 species are similar in size (Fig. 8 ). Based on this pattern of positive dental allometry, it has been suggested that paedomorphosis is the mechanism of insular dwarfing in some lineages (Fortelius 1985) .In contrast to the dentition, the metatarsal of B. cebuensis does not exhibit the pattern of size reduction typical of island dwarfs; it is 71.5% the length of the humerus in B. cebuensis, a value comparable to that of B. bubalis examined (68-72.5%). However, the metatarsal does appear to be reduced in B. mindorensis, being only 59-60% the length of the humerus. Whether such reductions in distal limb elements are attributable to paedomorphosis or simply are locomotor adaptations (e.g., Sondaar 1977 ) may depend on the mosaic pattern of insular evolution in the particular species in question; the metatarsal of B. mindorensis more closely resembles an osteologically mature B. bubalis than a slightly less mature one ( Fig. 4 ), but testing for such an ontogenetically driven trend would certainly require examining much younger individuals of B. bubalis.",

In conjunction with the presence of Bubalus on Mindoro Island (and potentially Luzon), discovery of this specimen suggests that Bubalus may once have ranged throughout the Philippines-a hypothesis that hopefully will be tested by future paleontological sampling across the islands. Similarly, this discovery, combined with the exceptionally high endemism and diversity of the extant mammal fauna of the Philippines, suggest that many more new late Cenozoic to Holocene fossil species remain to be recovered from this region. B. cebuensis is clearly referable to the subgenus Bubalus, and is diagnostically differentiated from B. mindorensis and B. bubalis by metric and morphological characteristics. In life, B. cebuensis was probably similar in stature to the lowland anoa, B. depressicornis, but regression equations from modern bovids suggest that it was approximately 15% more massive. The overall small size of B. cebuensis relative to other B. (Bubalus) appears to be attributable to island dwarfing, an explanation that is supported by the consistent relationship between body size and island size in B. cebuensis, B. mindorensis, and B. bubalis. Although the relatively large dentition of B. cebuensis suggests paedomorphosis as a possible mechanism of body-size reduction in this lineage, this is not supported by the relatively large (i.e., normal for this clade) size of the metatarsal relative to the humerus. Additional material of B. cebuensis would facilitate testing of paedomorphosis as a mechanism for dwarfing in these bovids, as would a detailed study of the postcranial osteology of B. mindorensis. Although the exact age of B. cebuensis is unknown, the condition of the material and its small size suggest it is no older than Pleistocene, and possibly Holocene. Further study of B. cebuensis and other island dwarfs may provide insights into the evolution of small-bodied hominins such as Homo floresiensis, yet another reason to be interested in dwarf mammals on oceanic islands in Indo-Australia.",
