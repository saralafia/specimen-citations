Two lengths. are necessary to define an area, and three are required to define a volume. Change in one length affects both area and volume, and leads to a change of shape. In fact, any change in any single measure of size (length, area, or volume) leads to a change in shape.

Nonisometric changes, involving changes in shape, are termed allometric. While there is a finite number of isometric relationships, allometry includes an infinite number of possibilities. For our purposes, only one allometric change is important. This is the allometry of heat production (basal metabolism) in eutherian mammals relative to body mass, which has been determined empirically to involve an allometric exponent k of 0. 75 (Kleiber, 1932; Schmidt-Nielsen, 1975) . Note that this metabolic exponentof0.75 differs from all of the geometric exponents and their inverses discussed above. If, in examining tooth crown area in relation to body mass, we can distinguish a scaling coefficient of 0.75 from 0.67, then we might suspect that crown area is somehow responding to requirements of metabolism and not simply changing isometrically.",

Choice of a body size standard is often dictated by the standard employed in other studies to which comparison will be made. Occasionally it may be necessary to repeat allometric analyses with different body size standards to make them comparable to a diverse range of related studies. It is sometimes best to study the allometry of body architecture in relation to body length or limb length rather than body mass. Cranial allometry in a series of fossil species, for example, might best be studied relative to one or more cranial dimensions rather than body mass because body mass cannot be measured directly in fossil species. However, comparison with modern species for which body mass is known might make it advantageous to use predicted body mass in the fossils as a baseline. The choice of a body size standard must be appropriate for the overall objectives of any given study.",

Kay (1975b) measured total crown length and other detailed morphological characteristics of lower second molars to relate functional features of molar structure to diet in primates. Gould (1975) measured the sum of maxillary postcanine crown areas in studying the relationship of tooth size to metabolism and/or environmental grain.

Error is inherent in both variables and, given some degree of correlation between variables, the principal or major axis best describes the slope or scaling relationship of the variables. The third objective, prediction of body size from tooth size, requires a different approach. Here tooth size is assumed to be known and error is inherent in only one variable, predicted body size. Least squares regression is explicitly designed for prediction problems, minimizing error in the dependent variable. Regression of body size on tooth size is appropriate in determining equations for predicting body size from tooth size.",

                "text": "Species of Tarsius stood out well above baseline in our original analysis of tooth size scaling in primates. Tarsius has relatively large cheek teeth for its body size. It is unusual among primates in being almost exclusively insectivorous (MacKinnon and MacKinnon, 1980) . In an attempt to better understand scaling differences in Tarsius, we compiled tooth size and body size measurements for a broadly representative sample of mammalian insectivores, comprising 40 species of Insectivora in the five families Soricidae, Talpidae, Erinaceidae, Macroscelidae, and Tupaiidae. Zalambdodont species Note that neither group differs significantly from geometric scaling (isometry). The scalipg coefficient of each group is significantly below that predicted for metabolic scaling. Data fro~ Table I. in the families Chrysochloridae, Solenodontidae, Tenrecidae, and Potamogalidae were also studied, but these species were excluded from analysis because of their unusually specialized dental morphology. We measured crown area (crown length multiplied by width) to characterize tooth size, and used body weight as a measure of body size. All measurements of upper and lower first molars were taken from original specimens. Body weights for individual specimens or species were taken from specimen labels or from the literature. Sexual dimorphism in insectivores is negligible, and we used five or more specimens of each sex to represent a species whenever possible. A full analysis of these data will be published elsewhere. Upper first molars in Insectivora scale with an allometric coefficient k of 0.55 (95% confidence interval 0.50-0.60; Table 2 ). This is slightly less than the coefficient k of 0.57 in frugivorous and folivorous primates, and it is well below the geometric scaling coefficient of0.67. We do not have measurements for other upper cheek teeth in insectivores, but, assuming the pattern in insectivores follows that in primates, coefficients for other cheek teeth are probably higher than 0.55. Upper cheek teeth as a unit may approach geometric scaling. However, the scaling value for M 1 alone is so far below the metabolic coefficient of 0.75 as to make metabolic scaling in the upper dentition very unlikely.",

Insectivores have an intercept In b well above that of primates (-0.40 versus -1.27 for M 1 and -0.95 versus -2.12 for M 1 ). Similar allometric coefficients coupled with greater tooth size intercepts mean that tooth size is greater in insectivores than it is in frugivorous and folivorous primates. This difference is illustrated graphically in Fig. 5 , where solid figures represent insectivores, and half-shaded figures represent six species of Tupaiidae and six species of insectivorous primates (Tarsius bancanus, T. borneanus, T. spectrum, T. syrichta, Galago demidovii, and Loris tardigradus) . Microcebus murinus is regarded as a frugivore (Kay, l975b) , but it falls very close to Galago demidovii and, like G. demidovii and Loris tardigradus, it appears to be intermediate between insectivores and primate frugivores/folivores. Species of Tarsius are unusual among primates in falling well above the general primate scaling axis and astride the insectivore scaling axis, a position consistent with their insectivorous habit.",

This positive allometry in tooth size approached the positive allometry of metabolism, leading Pilbeam and Gould to suggest a possible functional link between tooth size and metabolic rate in primates and other mammals. Kay (1975a) challenged this with data showing that tooth size usually scales isometrically (geometrically) rather than metabolically in homogeneous dietary groups. A major difference in the two studies involves the choice of a standard for body size. Pilbeam and Gould used skull length in six examples, body mass in two examples, and femur length in the final example. The only scaling coefficient that was significantly greater in a statistical sense than that predicted by isometry was scaling of total cheek tooth area against skull length in hystricognath rodents. Kay used body mass as a standard for body size, and found that none of the seven groups he examined had scaling coefficients significantly greater than predicted by isometry. Four of Kay's seven examples had scaling coefficients significantly lower than predicted by metabolic scaling. Total cheek tooth area was used in . . /~000 Table 2 ) with that in 43 species of frugivorous and folivorous primates (Table 1) . Note the similarity in allometric scaling coefficients (slopes) in both groups, and higher tooth size intercept in Insectivora. Insectivores have larger central cheek teeth than do frugivorous and folivorous primates at any given body size. The apparent contradiction between Pilbeam and Gould's results and those of Kay can be resolved by noting the different standards of body size used in each study. Skull length, femur length, and body mass are highly correlated in mammals, but one does not scale isometrically with the other. Smith ( 1981) has shown this clearly for a broad range of anthropoid primates. Given that they are not the same, which standard is appropriate? In this particular case the answer is clear. All attempts to quantify the relationship of metabolism to body size involve scaling metabolic rate against body mass. The relationship of metabolic rate to skull length or to femur length has never been studied. Body mass is clearly the only appropriate standard if results are to be compared with metabolic scaling.",

Cheek teeth as a unit appear to scale geometrically, and it seems unlikely that \"metabolic\" coefficients in the anterior and posterior cheek teeth actually reflect any relationship to metabolism.
