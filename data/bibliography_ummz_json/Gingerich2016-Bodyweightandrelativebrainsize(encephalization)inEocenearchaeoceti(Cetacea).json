Observations of phenotypic traits in cetacean species living today are independent of phylogeny and independent statistically. Four methods for estimating body weight in fossil cetaceans are compared: (1) median serial regression involving a set of multiple regressions of log body weight on log centrum length, width, and height for core vertebrae; (2) regression of log whole body weight on log body length for individuals; (3) regression of log whole body weight on log body length for species means; and (4) regression of log lean body weight on log body length for individuals. These yield body weight estimates for the Eocene archaeocete Dorudon atrox of 1126, 1118, 1132, and 847 kg, respectively, with consistency and applicability to partial skeletons favoring the first approach. The whole-body weight expected, P e (in kg), for a given body length, L i (in cm), is given by log 10 P e =2.784 \u2022 log 10 L i \u2212 4.429. Negative allometry of body weight and body length (slope 2.784<3.000) means that small cetaceans are shorter and more maneuverable than expected for their weight, while large cetaceans are longer and more efficient energetically than expected for their weight. Encephalization is necessarily quantified relative to a reference sample, most mammals are terrestrial, and terrestrial mammals provide a logical baseline. The encephalization residual for living terrestrial mammals as a class (ER TC), is the difference between observed log 2 brain weight (E i in g) and expected log 2 brain weight (E e in g), where the latter is estimated from body weight (P i in g), as log 2 E e =0.740 \u2022 log 2 P i \u22124.004. ER TC is positive for brains that are larger than expected for a given body size, and negative for brains that are smaller than expected. Base-2 logarithms make the ER TC scale intuitive, in uniform units of halving or doubling. Encephalization quotients (EQ) are unsuitable for comparison because they are proportions on a nonuniform scale. Middle Eocene archaeocetes have ER TC values close to \u22122 (two halvings compared to expectation), while late Eocene archaeocetes have ER TC values close to \u22121 (one halving compared to expectation). ER TC is not known for fossil mysticetes, but living mysticetes have ER TC values averaging about \u22122. Oligocene-Recent odontocetes appear to have ER TC values averaging about +1 (one doubling compared to expectation) through their temporal range.

When these were described, Uhen (1996) determined that the length of the skeleton was 485 cm. Uhen (1996) inserted this into a regression of body weight on body length for extant cetaceans and estimated the weight of D. atrox to have been 2700 kg (see also Marino et al. 2000 Marino et al. , 2004 . I approached the problem differently, seeking a method applicable to partial skeletons. When the body weight of D. atrox was estimated from the sizes of individual vertebrae, the overall estimate was much smaller at 1140 kg (Gingerich 1998) . Uhen (2004) augmented his body weight regression for extant Cetacea and revised his estimate for D. atrox downward to 2240 kg, but this is still almost twice the estimate from vertebrae based on the same specimens.",

This study was initiated as an attempt to resolve the discrepancy in weight estimates for Dorudon atrox by generating a new regression of lean-body weight on body length as a substitute for the whole-body regression of Uhen (1996 Uhen ( , 2004 . It was possible to compile a set of lean body weights and lengths for Cetacea, but also a much larger and more representative set of whole body weights and lengths than that used by Uhen. Three principles underlie this work that are worth mentioning. First, functional relationships in the organic world are proportional and must be studied in a geometric framework. We measure arithmetically by counting units of equal size, whether these are units of length, weight, or some other quantity. Arithmetic counts must be transformed logarithmically to represent the geometric quantities of functional interest. Logarithmic transformation is not done to normalize distributions of variation, but to represent variation in the geometric framework in which it is functional (and normal; Gingerich 2000) . Transformation is not done to linearize allometric relationships, but to represent these in the geometric framework in which they are functional (and linear). Transformation is not done to standardize variation, but to represent this in the geometric framework in which it is functional (and has a characteristic standard).",

These relationships are different because the allometries themselves are different and also because regression slopes are sensitive to the range of the independent variable. A slope of zero indicating an absence of relationship is the null hypothesis in regression and, all else being equal, subsets of a larger set of variables will have shallower slopes than the larger set because the samples are smaller, the ranges of the independent variable are likely to be smaller, statistical power is less, and regression is conservative, protecting the null hypothesis.",

Felsenstein adopted a model of Brownian motion in which variance accumulates in proportion to branch length throughout a phylogenetic tree, and used the branch lengths (accumulated variances) to bring contrasts to a common scale for comparison.

We can take this a step further than Felsenstein did by considering the time scale of the process being modeled, and by including an independently determined rate of accumulation of variance on this time scale. A time scale of one generation, iterated repeatedly, is the time scale of random genetic drift and the time scale of both stabilizing and directional selection. Selection experiments, field studies, and the fossil record are consistent in finding a rate of about 0.1 standard deviation per generation on a time scale of one generation (Gingerich 2001) . A rate of 0.1 standard deviation per generation is equivalent to accumulation of 0.01 units of variance per generation on a per-generation time scale.

On longer time scales diffusion alone can explain any distribution of body lengths, and phylogeny is no longer a factor. Body lengths and other phenotypic measures are now independent of phylogeny and independent of each other. They are amenable to ordinary statistical analysis without computing phylogenetic contrasts. The median age at first reproduction is nine years in cetaceans, and the median generation time is 18 years (Taylor et al. 2007) .

This transition involved specialization of the cranium for feeding, and modification of the neck, forelimbs, hind limbs, and tail for swimming. Brain enlargement is an open question that must be studied in relation to body size (see below). The thorax and lumbus of primitive archaeocetes (best known in Protocetidae) were less subject to specialization, and hence vertebral centrum size for this part of the body provides a conservative estimate of body weight in archaeocetes. However, the posterior thorax and lumbus of later Basilosauridae (such as Dorudon) were more involved in locomotion, with a torso more like that of modern Cetacea (Buchholtz 2001) . Here body size estimation is based on median serial regression involving core vertebrae, the 19 thoracics and lumbars of Protocetidae (and their homologues in other archaeocetes), omitting cervicals (vertebrae 1-7) because of their involvement in feeding (when elongated) or swimming (when shortened), and omitting vertebrae beyond the 26th (supernumerary lumbars, sacrals, and caudals) because of their involvement in swimming.",

This is partly a reflection of the difference in size between smaller Odontoceti and larger Mysticeti, but it is also a reflection of the difficulty of weighing medium and large cetaceans. Small cetaceans are relatively easy to weigh, but weights for large cetaceans are generally only available for species large enough to be worth exploiting commercially. Fortunately, there are lengths and whole-body weights available for some medium-sized cetaceans (Fig. 3) , and these fall on or near the whole-sample regression line.",

D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson (1912) D'Arcy Thompson (1912) had a theory to justify his expectation for the body weight of a blue whale, but a single empirical observation provided no constraint on his purely theoretical model. Later, Laurie (1933) collected lengths and weights for three blue whales and showed that Thompson's estimate of weight for an adult blue whale was much too great. If Thompson had compared weights for a few whales of different sizes he would have seen that weight change in cetaceans is allometric rather than isometric. Cetaceans change shape in a systematic way as they change size: their weights (and volumes) decrease more or increase less in proportion to decreasing or increasing length than Thompson expected.",

Stated another way, small cetaceans are shorter than expected for their body weight, and large cetaceans are longer than expected for their body weight.

This is calculated as the ratio of brain weight observed for the species to the brain weight expected for a mammal of that species' body weight. Measuring observed brain weight, E i , is a straightforward matter of weighing the brain (weight in grams). Alternatively, brain weight can be estimated by measuring the volume of the braincase, in cubic centimeters, and making the reasonable assumption that brains have a density more or less equivalent to that of water. Jerison (1955 Jerison ( , 1973 calculated expected brain weight, E e , as k times body weight P i raised to the \u00df power: E e =k P i \u00df . Coefficients k and \u00df were estimated by linear regression of log brain weight on log body weight: log 10 E e =log 10 k+\u00df log 10 P i . In developing this approach, Jerison (1961) found the intercept log 10 k to be about \u22120.93 (meaning k=0.12) and the slope or allometric scaling coefficient \u00df to be approximately 2/3 or 0.67. Jerison's numbers were initially based on a small sample of living mammals, but I have confirmed that 0.67 is a reasonable average for allometric scaling of brain weight and body weight in living mammals on the taxonomic scale of orders (see Pagel and Harvey 1988) .",

This is an empirical finding, just as 0.67 is an empirical finding on a different taxonomic scaleexistence of the discrepancy means taxonomic scale is important. There is a further complication. Living mammals include terrestrial, aquatic, and volant forms, which have slightly different relationships of brain weight to body weight. When we consider the baseline allometric scaling of brain size and body size we must specify both the substrate preference and the taxonomic scale. This can be done by subscripting the acronym EQ with a 'T' for terrestrial mammals, and an 'O' or a 'C' to indicate the taxonomic scale. Hence EQ TO indicates that the reference sample is terrestrial mammals as orders, and EQ TC indicates that the reference sample is terrestrial mammals as a class. The same convention holds for encephalization residuals ('ER'; see below), where ER TC indicates that the reference sample is terrestrial mammals as a class. Figure 6 shows the allometric scaling of log 10 brain weight to log 10 body weight for 778 species of terrestrial mammals, representing mammals as a class (gray solid circles). The units (two-sigma 95 % confidence interval of \u22124.538 to \u22124.286), with a coefficient of determination of 0.987. Inserting a body length for Dorudon atrox of 485 cm (Uhen 2004) into the allometric equation yields an estimated body weight of 847 kg (two-sigma 95 % confidence interval 515 to 1394). Gray circles represent the whole body weights and lengths shown in Fig. 3 on both axes represent orders of magnitude. Here the allometric scaling coefficient \u00df is 0.740, the intercept k is \u22121.205, and the coefficient of determination r 2 is 0.947. The expected brain weight Y for a given body weight X is shown by the heavier dashed line, and 95 % prediction limits are shown by the lighter dashed lines above and below the line of expectation.",

The same is true for body weight, which has a slightly smaller disparity or range of morphological difference from the smallest to the largest extant species of 23 standard deviation units. On longer time scales diffusion can explain any distribution of body lengths and other phenotypic measures, phylogeny is no longer a factor, and traits of interest are amenable to statistical analysis without computing phylogenetic contrasts. Three of the approaches to body weight estimation for Dorudon atrox investigated here provide consistent estimates, and one does not. The three that are consistent are: (1) median serial regression of vertebral centrum size (Fig. 2) ; (2) estimation from body length using whole-body weights of individuals (Fig. 3) ; and (3) estimation from body length using mean whole-body weights for species (Fig. 4) . The fourth approach, estimation from body length using lean-body weights (Fig. 5) , yields body weights that are substantially smaller compared to the other three estimates. The positive outcome of this fourway comparison is confirmation that body weight can be estimated from vertebral centrum size (Fig. 2) and from body length (Figs. 3 and 4 ) for archaeocetes such as D. atrox that have the body form of a modern cetacean.",

                "text": "The evidence for cetacean brain size evolution through geological time is summarized in Fig. 9 . The oldest archaeocetes for which we have evidence of brain size and body size are from the middle Eocene: Rodhocetus kasranii and Remingtonocetus ahmedi (Gingerich 1998 ; Table 1 ). The youngest archaeocetes for which we have evidence of brain size and body size are from the late Eocene: D. atrox, Zygorhiza kochii, and Saghacetus osiris (Gingerich 1998 (Gingerich , 2015 Uhen 2004;  Table 1 ). These show a change from an encephalization residual ER T C of about \u22122 to an encephalization residual ER TC of about \u22121. Thus, it appears there was a full doubling of brain size relative to body size in this ten million year span of archaeocete evolution. Marino et al. (2004 Marino et al. ( : 1252 concluded that Bthere was no significant increase in brain size over the course of archaeocete evolution,b ut this is contradicted by the pattern in Fig. 9 . The oldest fossil odontocete in the Montgomery et al. (2013) database used here is early Oligocene Simocetus rayi, known from a cranium and mandible (Fordyce 2002) . Brain weight for S. rayi was estimated using computed tomography to measure the endocranial volume (Marino et al. 2004) . Marino et al. (2004) found the coefficient of determination relating body weight to occipital condyle breadth to be r 2 =0.79, which is not particularly high. Statistically, this means that 79 % of the variance in body weight is attributable to occipital condyle breadth, but 21 % of the variance has some other source. In an exercise predicting body length in fossil cetaceans, occipital condyle breadth (OCB) underestimated a combined partial least squares (PLS) statistic in 15 of 16 cases (Pyenson and Sponberg 2011) . When body weight is underestimated, encephalization will be overestimated. Marino et al. (2004) did not report which of their odontocete specimens had weights estimated from occipital condyle breadth, and hence virtually all of the ER TC values for fossil odontocetes (open circles) in Fig. 9 are suspect. Cetacean skeletons are often well preserved in the field and it is surprising that these are so rarely collected and studied. The relationship of body weight to body length documented here (Figs. 3 and 4) should encourage more and better body weight estimates, and multiproxy methods are available for estimation of body size from crania (Pyenson and Sponberg 2011) . Computerized tomography of fossils enables nondestructive reconstruction and measurement of brains and brain size (Marino et al. 2003) .

                "text": "The evolution of brain size in Cetacea is an interesting and important problem that would benefit from better documentation. Hopefully the gaps and open circles in Fig. 9 will be interpreted as targets of opportunity inspiring more and better empirical research on brain and body size in archaeocetes, mysticetes, and odontocetes. Fig. 8 Comparison of encephalization residuals (ER, on a log 2 halvingdoubling scale) to the corresponding encephalization quotients (EQ, on an arithmetic scale). Points on the graph represent units of equal difference in relative brain size. Note that encephalization quotients progressively underestimate differences in relative brain size for EQ values less than one (below the dashed line), and progressively overestimate these differences for EQ values greater than one (above the dashed line). Encephalization residuals (ER) represent differences in relative brain size uniformly in the correct proportion Fig. 9 Evolution of brain size through geological time in Archaeoceti, Mysticeti, and Odontoceti. Relative brain size is quantified as the encephalization residual ER TC in relation to the brain size expected for living terrestrial mammals analyzed as a class (see text and Fig. 7) . Archaeocete species are represented by solid diamonds, mysticete species by solid triangles, and odontocete species by circles that are solid where brain weight and body weight have been measured and open where estimates of one or both of these are questionable (see text). Note the trend toward increasing brain size in Eocene Archaeoceti. All mysticetes have brains smaller in comparison to body size than expected for an average terrestrial mammal living today (with ER TC << 0) , and most odontocetes have brains larger than expected for an average terrestrial mammal living today (ER TC >0). Physeter catodon, with ER TC =\u22121.61, is the conspicuous odontocete exception. ER TC values for archaeocete species are taken from Table 1 ; those for mysticete and odontocete species were calculated from supplemental information in Montgomery et al. (2013) , with anomalous values for Balaena mysticetus replaced by those of Thewissen et al. (2011) . Time scale is from Vandenberghe et al. (2012) .
