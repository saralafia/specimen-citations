In the course of our phylogenetic research on the New World marsupial family Didelphidae, we sequenced 2790 bp of the RAGl exon from exemplar species of most extant genera. Phylogenetic analysis of these sequences recovered an anomalous node consisting of two clades previously shown to be distantly related based on analyses of other molecular data. These two clades show significantly increased GC content at RAGl third codon positions, and the resulting convergence in base composition is strong enough to overwhelm phylogenetic signal from other genes (and morphology) in most analyses of concatenated datasets. This base-compositional convergence occurred relatively recently (over tens rather than hundreds of millions of years), and the affected gene region is still in a state of evolutionary disequilibrium. Both mutation rate and substitution rate are higher in GC-rich didelphid taxa, observations consistent with RAGl sequences having experienced a higher rate of recombination in the convergent lineages.

                "text": "Base-compositional heterogeneity, as indicated by significant taxonomic differences in GC (versus AT) content among homologous sequences, is now widely recognized as a potential problem for phylogenetic analysis (e.g., by Loomis and Smith, 1990; Hasegawa and Hashimoto, 1993; Lake, 1994; Lockhart et al, 1994; Foster and Hickey, 1999; Mooers and Holmes, 2000; Tarrio et al., 2002; Jeffroy et al., 2006; Barrowclough et al., 2006) . Both simulation studies (Lake, 1994; Conant and Lewis, 2001 ) and analyses of biological data sets (Lockhart et al., 1994; Chang and Campbell, 2000; Tarrio et al., 2002) suggest that commonly used phylogenetic methods may cluster taxa based on GC content rather than evolutionary history when similar base composition has evolved convergently in unrelated clades. Despite considerable interest in base-compositional convergence, only a few empirical examples have been reported in the literature (Conant and Lewis, 2001) . The most compelling of these involve genes in photosynthetic organelles (Lockhart et al., 1992 (Lockhart et al., , 1994 , phyla of bacteria (Galtier and Gouy, 1998) , major clades of animals (Foster and Hickey, 1999) , and ancient lineages of vertebrates (Chang and Campbell, 2000; Lockhart et al., 1994) . Convincing examples of base-compositional convergence at lower taxonomic levels are seldom reported and few (Tarrio et al., 2000 (Tarrio et al., , 2001 have been analyzed in detail.",

RAGl is a single-copy, intron-free, proteincoding nuclear locus that has been used for phylogenetic inference in a variety of other vertebrate groups (e.g., Groth and Barrowclough, 1999; Barker etal., 2002; Waddell and Shelley, 2003; Mahon and Carpenter, 2004; San Mauro etal., 2005) . Because previous analyses of RAGl sequence data resulted in highly resolved and robustly supported phylogenetic relationships at multiple hierarchical levels, we anticipated a straightforward analysis of our didelphid data. Instead, we discovered a striking example of convergent base composition that affords an unusual opportunity to explore the application of commonly suggested methodological remedies and to examine alternative evolutionary explanations.",

First, we evaluated each taxon for differences from the average base composition across taxa for each codon position using a x 2 goodness-of-fit test (Bonferroni-corrected a = 0.001). Second, we calculated the disparity index (ID) for each codon position (Kumar and Gadagkar, 2001 ) using MEGA version 3.0 (Kumar etal., 2004) . This test compares the observed compositional difference between a given pair of sequences (D c ) with the compositional difference (Nd) that would be expected if the sequences were evolving under equilibrium (ID = D c -Nd). Two sequences that are perfectly homogeneous will have an ID value of zero; consequently, higher ID values reflect increasingly different base composition between sequence pairs. The significance of a given ID value is assessed by comparison with a Monte Carlo-generated distribution of expected values assuming a model of equilibrium base substitution (Kumar and Gadagkar, 2001) .",

For maximum likelihood (ML) analyses, we determined the best-fit model of nucleotide substitution for various partitions of the molecular data using the Akaike information criterion (AIC) as implemented in ModelTest 3.6 (Posada and Crandall, 1998) . We evaluated the fit of various models to each gene (IRBP, DMP1, and RAG1) independently and to the combined molecular dataset. In addition, we partitioned the RAG1 data into third codon positions and first + second codon positions, and we evaluated the best-fit model for each of these partitions. Finally, we employed a likelihood-ratio test to determine whether a molecular clock could be applied to the sequence data. Following model evaluation and selection, we obtained the maximum likelihood tree using a heuristic search in which parameter values were fixed according to the best-fit model, and a neighborjoining tree was used as starting point for TBR branch swapping.",

To provide the tree and branch lengths for this analysis, we optimized branch lengths for RAG1 third positions on the topology resulting from likelihood analysis of all data except RAG1 third positions. We established the best value for the smoothing parameter using the cross-validataion procedure with smoothing values ranging from 10~1 0 to 100. Searches using the optimal smoothing value (S = 0.001) employed the truncated Newton algorithm with 10 random restarts and 10 subsequent perturbations. Estimates of per-branch rates were scaled against time by setting the origin of didelphines to 40 million years based on the results published by Steiner et al. (2005) .",

Briefly, although trees resulting from separate analyses of these data sets show some topological differences, none are significant when assessed by comparing bootstrap support values node-by-node or by performing Shimodaira-Hasegawa tests. Therefore, we combined the IRBP, DMP1, and morphological data in a single matrix and analyzed them simultaneously using parsimony. The resulting strict consensus of four minimal-length trees (Fig. 1A) is highly resolved and includes several well-supported groups. In particular, clades C and H are recovered with strong (>90%) bootstrap support in our combined-data analysis. Both of these groups were previously sup-ported by our separate analyses of IRBP (e.g., Jansa and Voss, 2000) and DMP1 (Jansa et al., 2006) , and they have also been recovered by scnDNA hybridization (Kirsch and Palma, 1995) and by Bayesian analyses of 12S rRNA and TTR intron sequences (Steiner et al., 2005) .",

A higher substitution rate is suggested by significant rate heterogeneity across taxa at RAGl third positions as assessed by a hierarchical likelihood-ratio test designed to assess the fit of a molecular clock (-lnLcTR+i+r+ciock = 9268.74, 8 = 547.28, df = 39, P \u00ab: 0.001), together with a significant positive correlation between pairwise patristic distances (based on ML-estimated branch lengths) and the extent of departure from base-compositional homogeneity (represented by ID values) for RAGl third positions (Mantel test: 1000 replicates, r = 0.495, P< 0.001). Moreover, a penalized likelihood analysis of molecular evolutionary rate indicates that third positions of RAGl are evolving much more quickly in the GC3-rich clades (B and I) than they are in any other taxa (Fig. 5 ). This rate increase in GC3-rich taxa appears to be peculiar to the RAGl locus because it is not apparent for DMP1 or IRBP. Although DMP1 does exhibit significant among-taxa rate heterogeneity (-lnLcTR-i+r+ciock = 5966.36, 8 = 117.78, df = 39, P \u00ab 0.001), long branches for this data partition are not associated with the same taxa that show long branches for RAGl third positions. IRBP exhibits no significant rate heterogeneity among didelphids (-lnL G TR + i + r + ciock = 4511.05, 8 = 53.67, df = 39, p = 0.059).",

The resulting convergence in base composition is sufficiently strong that phylogenetic analyses of RAGl sequences, separately or in combination with other data sets, strongly support a group (B+I) that contains these two GC-rich but historically unrelated clades. It is of no small concern that two phylogenetic methods explicitly designed to account for base-compositional heterogeneity among taxa not only failed to recover the correct placement of clades B and I but supported their anomalous grouping with high statistical support. Thus, RAGl 92 SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY VOL. 56 sequence evolution in didelphids provides a particularly clear example of convergent base composition misleading phylogenetic inference. Didelphid RAGl evolution is of further interest because it shows that severe base-compositional shifts can occur over comparatively short evolutionary timescales. Recent phylogenetic research indicates that the marsupial crown group is not known from pre-Tertiary fossils (Rougier et al., 1998) . Moreover, according to Steiner et al.'s (2005) age estimates of didelphid cladogenetic events (based on relaxed-molecular-clock methods applied to nuclear gene sequences), the base-compositional shifts described in this report probably occurred sometime between 12 and 30 million years ago. By contrast, most previously reported examples of convergent base composition (cited in our Introduction) involve clades that are hundreds of million years old. The relative re-cency of base-compositional shifts for didelphid RAGl sequences may explain, in part, why the two GC-rich lineages we identified show no evidence of having reached base-compositional equilibrium.",

In contrast, the x 2 goodnessof-fit test for individual departures from average GC content was unable to identify particular taxa that deviated from the average base composition of these data. However, we note that these AGC estimates are based on the total number of sites sequenced, rather than the subset of those sites that are parsimony informative. When we recalculated average differences in base composition between clades based on informative sites alone, the average AGC for RAG1 third positions between biased and nonbiased clades is 29%.

Therefore, we would like to include the relevant phylogenetic signal that this gene contains in a combined-data analysis while mitigating the misleading signal due to base-compositional convergence. One possibility involves explicitly modeling (Galtier and Gouy, 1998; Yang and Roberts, 1995) or correcting for (Lockhart etal, 1994; Lake, 1994) base-compositional heterogeneity across taxa. However, model-based approaches can be parameter-rich and difficult to implement in a combined data analysis; they are also conspicuously ineffective when applied to our nonstationary RAG1 sequences. Short of eliminating the biased gene entirely, different ways of handling such problematic .datasets have been proposed (Loomis and Smith, 1990; Hasegawa and Hashimoto, 1993; Kumar and Gadagkar, 2001; Collins et al., 2005; Jeffroy et al., 2006) . Among the most tractable are (1) analyzing amino acid sequences, (2) eliminating third positions, or (3) including only third position transversions (e.g., by \"RY-coding\"). As applied to our data, all three methods effectively eliminate the misleading signal due to basecompositional convergence: the spurious B-f-I clade was not recovered by any method, and nodes C and H were recovered with comparably high bootstrap support in all three analyses (Fig. 6 ). However, these procedures do affect the degree of resolution and support for recovered relationships within the GC-rich clades.",

Theoretically, these mismatches should be repaired correctly to T: A and C:G, respectively. However, mismatch repair in mammals appears to be biased by a DNA repair mechanism that preferentially repairs T:G mismatches to C:G (Brown and Jiricny, 1987) . This process has been termed biased gene conversion (BGC) and, if it occurs frequently, could cause regions of high recombination to become increasingly GC-rich (Galtier et al., 2001; Montoya-Burgos etal., 2003; Meunier and Duret, 2004) . Mounting evidence strongly favors BGC as an important process driving base-compositional differences across the mammalian genome (Eyre-Walker and Hurst, 2001; Birdsell, 2002; Piganeau et al., 2002; Galtier, 2004; Perry and Ashworth, 1999) . Moreover, if sequences are not at basecompositional equilibrium (and these GC-rich didelphid sequences are not; Table 4 ), then BGC predicts that the rate of silent substituiton (K s ) will be both elevated and GC-biased (Piganeau et al., 2002) . Consistent with these predictions, the GC-rich didelphid lineages all exhibit ah elevated rate of substitution and a biased direction of substitution from AT -\u00bb GC. In addition, heterozygosity values for these taxa suggest that the GC-rich lineages also exhibit a relatively high rate of mutation, which is not necessarily a predicted outcome of BGC.",

Given these findings, one possible explanation for our results is that RAGl independently acquired a recombination hotspot in the ancestral lineages of clades B and I. Although we do not have direct estimates of recombination rates for these taxa, if RAGl contains a 1-to 2-kb recombination hotspot, then we would expect the GC-rich region in affected taxa to be localized over only part of the sequenced 2.7-kb fragment. A sliding-window analysis reveals that GC-rich and non-GC-rich sequences have a similar base-compositional profile across the first 600 to 700 bp of the RAGl exon, and that the GC-rich sequences diverge and adopt their characteristic base composition thereafter (Fig. 7) . Although this result may be consistent with alternative explanations, including selection maintaining base composition across the 5' region of the gene, it may be evidence of an elevated recombination rate for part of the gene. If so, and if recombination hotspots are as evolutionarily mobile as recent studies suggest, then the base-compositional convergence that plagues our phylogenetic analysis of the RAGl locus may be more widespread across nuclear loci than previously anticipated.",
