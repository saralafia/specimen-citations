The northern and southern continents were then isolated until late Tertiary. During this period of isolation, South America developed its perculiar mammalian fauna. A quite different fauna was evolving in North America. When land connections were again established, there was an extension of geographic range of certain South American species northward over the isthmus and of certain North American species southward. It was not an exchange of faunas, but an addition to each by the other. During late Tertiary and early Quarternary, some of the South American elements gradually extended northward where habitats and other environmental conditions permitted. Subsequently, during glaciation, the northern faunas were pushed southward and undoubtedly some, or all, of the invaders from South America retreated again. The lemming vole ( S y n a p t m y s ) , now a boreal or sub-boreal species, occurred as far south as Nuevo Leon (Cushing, 1945) . As the glaciers retreated northward there was again a northward shift of faunas-a shift of both northern and southern species. This last shift is probably still in progress.",

The balance swings from predominantly southern to northern in total taxonomic relationships.

Our knowledge of the mammals of Michoacan is yet far from complete, but, with the exception of the bats, we have a fairly good idea of the genera found there. Exclusive of bats, there are thirty-six genera of recent wild land mammals known from Michigan and thirty-four (possibly a few more) from the tableland and mountains of Michoacan. The two faunas are of nearly equal size as regards numbers of kinds. Seventeen genera and nine species of non-flying land mammals are common to the two areas. There are nineteen genera in Michigan that are not found in Michoacan and seventeen in the latter state that do not occur in Michigan.",
