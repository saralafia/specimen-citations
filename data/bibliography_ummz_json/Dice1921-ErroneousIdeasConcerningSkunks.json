                "text": "Augtist 10,1920, a member (not the writer) of a Michigan Museum of Zoology expedition working near Little Girl's Point in Gogebic County, Michigan, caught a nearly grown male skunk (Mephitis hudsonica) in a trap. A wire noose on a stick was slipped over the skunk's head, and after it was drawn tight and the animal partly choked, the trap was removed. The skunk, however, was not quite dead and to prevent him from getting his feet up on the noose, where he could have discharged his scent, th~ wire was given a slight jerk from time to time. At one of these jerks the wire \u2022broke. To keep the skunk from escaping while a new noose was being made the animal was held up by the tail. At this time he was nearly dead from the choking he had received, but he soon began to recover and suddenly without any warning he discharged a small quantity of the scent fluid into the left eye of his captor. The injured eye smarted sharply and both eyes immediately produced many tears. The eye was wiped out with a handkerchief, for there was no stream of water within a mile, and in about five minutes the smarting passed away, leaving, aside from the odor, no after effects.",

But if they can get the hind feet upon the trap which is holding a front foot the scent can be discharged. An instance of this kind happened in Gogebic County on the expedition above mentioned. If often happens, however, that a skunk which is handled slowly and cautiously in a trap can be lifted off the ground by a pole and will not discharge the scent even though three or all of hili! feet are on the pole. It may be possible then that a skunk might sometimes be held off the ground by the tail without disastrous results, but there is no question but that he is fully able 'to discharge the scent under these conditions.-LEE R.
