Findings: Here we present Biospytial, a modular open source knowledge engine designed to import, organise, analyse and visualise big spatial ecological datasets using the power of graph theory. The engine uses a hybrid graph-relational approach to store and access information. A graph data structure uses linkage relationships to build semantic structures represented as complex data structures stored in a graph database, while tabular and geospatial data are stored in an efficient spatial relational database system. We provide an application using information on species occurrences, their taxonomic classification and climatic datasets. We built a knowledge graph of the Tree of Life embedded in an environmental and geographical grid to perform an analysis on threatened species co-occurring with jaguars (Panthera onca). Conclusions: The Biospytial approach reduces the complexity of joining datasets using multiple tabular relations, while its scalable design eases the problem of merging datasets from different sources. Its modular design makes it possible to distribute several instances simultaneously, allowing fast and efficient handling of big ecological datasets. The provided example demonstrates the engine's capabilities in performing basic graph manipulation, analysis and visualizations of taxonomic groups co-occurring in space. The example shows potential avenues for performing novel ecological analyses, biodiversity syntheses and species distribution models aided by a network of taxonomic and spatial relationships.",

                "text": "The IT revolution has created the opportunity to compute, store, and transfer massive amounts of information. It is estimated that the volume of all digital information will surpass 175 zettabytes (ZB) (1 ZB = 10 21 bytes) by 2020 [1] . In addition, the growth in data follows an exponential curve that doubles in volume every 2 years ( [2] [3] [4] ). Moreover, this expansion in data production has occurred in all human activities, including the environmental sciences. Novel approaches for measuring natural processes are being applied, adding more reliable and diverse data, and environmental measurements cover a wide range of spatial and temporal scales ranging, for example, from long-term ecological experimental plots [5, 6] to near-real time imagery from Earth observation satellite systems such as NASA's Joint Polar Satellite System [7] and ESA's Copernicus programme [8] . This IT era is opening new opportunities for greater understanding of nature. For example, pervasive Internet connectivity has made possible the transfer of data across large distances in a short time, and the multifunctional capabilities of mobile and smart devices have enabled the management and deployment of collaborative surveys at low marginal costs. Geospatial sciences have benefited in particular. Methodologies for collecting, annotating, and curating these new sources of spatial data have been proposed by [9] [10] [11] under the term \"citizen science,\" where data are collectively assembled by a community of enthusiasts and volunteers. Some iconic examples of these (crowd-based) platforms are OpenStreetMap [12] for geographic maps and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), an international consortium of research and governmental institutions that gathers and publishes information of all types of biodiversity occurrences [13] .",

                "text": "A fundamental goal in ecology is the understanding of the relationships between living beings and the environment. A requirement to achieve this goal is the integration of independent studies and measurements to validate hypotheses on potential causal relations. To test the existence of these causalities, a substantial number of inputs in terms of theory, methods, and data is needed. Moreover, reliable, reproducible, and easy-to-access methods are especially important given the urgency in addressing ongoing environmental crises (e.g., rapid ecosystem degradation, global climate change, accelerated extinctions, and biodiversity loss) [17, 18] . Ecology is thus adapting rapidly to these critical challenges and is starting to adopt and develop novel theoretical and computational methods to solve a central problem: how to synthesize and integrate ecological theory with big ecological data. Answering this question requires an interdisciplinary approach that touches many fields, including theoretical ecology, mathematical modelling, statistics, computer science, and information sciences. For example, Loreau [19] proposed a conceptual framework for integrating ecological theory by centering evolution as the link to unify ecology; and Pavoine and Bonsall [20] proposed a semantic and mathematical formalization for unifying traits, species, and phylogenetic diversity. The 2 approaches exemplify how evolutionary (ancestry) relationships between biological objects constitute a solid base to unify distant branches of ecology. From a statistical perspective, meta-analysis has been effective in synthesizing research evidence across independent studies, including unveiling general relations through a statistically sound framework [21] .",

A clear example of geospatial data fusion is the building of essential biodiversity variables (EBVs) to identify biodiversity and ecosystem change [24] . EBVs constitute a minimal set of critical variables aimed to standardize and harmonize global biodiversity variables. Originally proposed by the Group on Earth Observations Biodiversity Observation Network (GEO BON) to assess biodiversity change globally [25] , EBVs are now being used to predict global species distributions and potential scenarios for policy options [26] . EBVs integrate data in a standardized framework that describes spatial, temporal, and biological organization [27] . Recently, methodologies for building EBVs have been drawing the attention of interdisciplinary research for reliability and data quality [28] . System designs and infrastructures for integrating heterogeneous big ecological data are emerging. Examples of these are the citizen-based bird observation network (eBird [29] ), the TRY database for plant traits [30] , the PREDICTS project (Projecting Responses of Ecological Diversity in Changing Terrestrial Systems) [31] , and the Botanical Information and Ecology Network [32] . Despite the data heterogeneity and biased information against real absences (a consequence of opportunistic sampling), these types of infrastructures are able to collect sufficient quantities of data to perform statistical inference ( [33, 34] ). The use of high-performance computational technologies with novel statistical methods for representing and modelling big ecological data can provide deeper understanding of biodiversity evolution and its dynamics in a changing world [25, 27, 35] . Moreover, its implications can be extended to other branches of ecology and earth sciences. For example, a process-based approach [36] showed how community assemblages can be integrated into dynamic vegetation models to increase the precision of climatic and earth system models.",

This allows the combined use of an efficient data management system with a broad range of statistical libraries and programming methodologies. An example of this is the integration of spatial analysis tools into the RDBMS through the Postgis project [37] , a set of compiled functions written in the Postgresql Procedural Language (PostgresPL) that interfaces with highlevel geospatial libraries (e.g., [38] [39] [40] ).

For example, matching data by a common feature involves the definition of join clauses plus computing the joined lookup between the pair of tables. The resulting product is often stored in volatile memory, a limiting factor when integrating large datasets. In a typical database design, table indices cost O(log(n)) in time, where O( \u2022 ) is the classic \"Big O,\" a measure of computational complexity, and n is the size of the input dataset. A query involving multiple joins (from multiple data tables) can involve reverse and recursive lookups, which can increase the load from O(n) to O(n k ), where k is the number of data tables to join. Although this issue can be addressed with database design techniques such as normalization [41] or caching [42] , the solution likely obfuscates the comprehension of the relational schema by adding unintuitive tables and other auxiliary information. It also requires a learning curve and expertise for implementation as well as increasing complexity when more datasets are added.",

Graph databases, however, are not as efficient at processing geospatial queries or handling simultaneous queries [44] . In this sense, hybrid data management systems, capable of handling both paradigms (relational tables and DAGs), were proposed to overcome the limitations of both systems.

Each module is arranged in virtual containers isolated as standalone applications [53] running a common Linux image (Debian 8) as the base operating system. The virtual container technology creates a common environment for each module, enabling the user to disregard the complications of working with heterogeneous computer infrastructures [54] . Its design allows the replication of several instances of the same module in a single computer or in a distributed network. Containerized applications are easier to replicate and migrate compared to large data volumes and databases, which often involve resource-intensive tasks in terms of energy, computing, network bandwidth, and management. The idea behind containerization is to move the processes not the data and, especially in the geospatial context, to perform spatial analysis where the data are located.",

Each node can belong to 1 or many classes. In our implementation, the relationships are semantic phrases that refer to location (e.g., \"IS IN\"), ancestry (\"IS PARENT OF\"), or topological features (\"IS CONTAINED IN\" or \"IS NEIGHBOUR OF\"). Thus, the engine uses explicit semantic relations between nodes to build a network of semantic information. The union of all these relationships is what we call a \"knowledge graph.\" The event of a species s being recorded at location l can be represented as a node of the class \"Species\" connected to a node l of class \"Cell\" using the relation \"IS IN\". The Cell nodes are contained in a regular lattice (grid) and are instantiated by a class that implements a geospatial type defined by a polygon that acts as a geometric border. As an example, Fig. 2 shows this diagram for the bird family of quetzales (Trogonidae) found in southeast Mexico. The node in red represents the species: Pharomachrus mocinno. The nodes in blue are 2 Cell types that associate the locations where P. mocinno was found. The arrows indicate the directional relationships between the nodes. The graph database allows easy manipulation of these nodes, their relations, and combinations. At the same time, the selected pattern can be filtered by chosen attribute values to generate customized design matrices.",

The design allows the request on demand of partial evaluations for a given traversal. This abstraction helps to explore, design, and automate the discovery of relevant patterns and structures. A concrete example of this design is shown in the next section with the analysis of local taxonomic trees; when the tree object is instantiated, it exists only as an abstract data container with no data requested to the database. As such, if an analyst is interested in studying the different species of bats (Order: Chiroptera) within this tree, she will need only to consider the descendant (children) nodes of the node Chiroptera of type Order (see Tutorial section for a practical example).",

The graph traversal was built recursively using the systematic classification of organisms, starting from the GBIF occurrences as leaf nodes and progressing through the parent nodes until the traversal reaches the node with no parent. That is, it begins at the species level and finalizes in the root node. At each step, the algorithm fetches the available nodes and groups them by their corresponding parent node, generating a set of parent nodes and their associated children. Each of these duples (parent, children) are incorporated into a LocalTree object that parses the relevant information into several attributes. This process is applied recursively on each derived parent node of the previous step. The recursion is terminated when the set of parent nodes is empty, generating the desired tree data structure. When this happens the LocalTree object is wrapped into a TreeNeo instance that extends some additional methods such as manipulating and querying trees, nodes, and multiple taxonomic groups as well as graph analysis and exportation to common exchange formats (e.g., graphml, data frames, png, geotif, or shapefiles). In addition, all the spatial structures were implemented with Open Source Geospatial (OSGEO) standards [90] to facilitate migration to other languages and platforms.

This integration creates a complex network of data with enormous potential for data mining, information retrieval, and visualization. At the core, a web of semantic-wise relationships constitutes a corpus of taxonomic and environmental knowledge that opens up new ways to query and unveil complex ecological relations. To our knowledge, there is no other open source system with the design and capacity to achieve this including (i) storing information in a hybrid relational-graph system and (ii) performing geospatial processes in vector and raster scalable databases.A practical example provided a glimpse into how to query and manipulate taxonomic tree structures, as well as how to extract data, conduct frequency analysi,s and visualize results. The example demonstrated a new procedure to rank co-occurring taxonomic groups in an arbitrary size neighbourhood of pixels.The GBIF occurrence data include information only on location and taxonomy, and in this sense the data are limited. However, the engine's design allows the capture, extension, and exploration of a semantic interpretation of the data by adding other types of relations. For example, linking information on trophic networks to the taxonomic backbone can help in analysing spatial patterns of trophic groups and dependant species, a key question in conservation biology.The development of Biospytial has followed best practices in scientific programming [105] . We recognize that spatial analyses are often not generalizable and therefore replicable. However replicability and reproducibility can be enhanced by increasing openness and documentation transparency and completeness [106] [107] [108] . In fact, Biospytial's source code is open and can be accessed at [109] while this article is Open Access. In the future, Biospytial can be further developed into a system not only for integration and distribution of datasets but also as a tool for collaboration, experimentation, validation, and reproduction of results in the era of Open Science, satisfying also the requisites of second-generation SDI.",
