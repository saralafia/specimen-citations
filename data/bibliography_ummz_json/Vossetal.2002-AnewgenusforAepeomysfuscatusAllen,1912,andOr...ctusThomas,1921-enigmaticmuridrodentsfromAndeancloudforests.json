Isolated from similar habitats in Central America by the R\u00edo Atrato lowlands of northwestern Colombia, and from temperate mon-tane rain forests in the southern Andes by treeless alpine deserts and grasslands, the cloud forests of the northern and central Andes harbor taxonomically distinctive mammalian communities that are among the least known of all terrestrial vertebrate faunas. Although a few large species are relatively well known as focal taxa for international conservation efforts-woolly tapirs (Tapirus pin-chaque), spectacled bears (Tremarctos ornatus) , pudus (Pudu mephistopheles), and yellow-tailed woolly monkeys (Lagothrix flavicauda)-the overwhelming majority of Andean cloud-forest mammals are small and virtually unstudied. Indeed, most museum collections of mammals from Andean cloud forests remain incompletely or inaccurately identified, with the result that patterns of species richness and endemism in this fauna are effectively unknown.",

Handley, Jr. (then curator of mammals at the National Museum of Natural History) and RSV (then a graduate student at the University of Michigan) independently examined the type series of Aepeomys fuscatus and concluded that it had been misclassified by Allen (1912) and by all subsequent compilers of Neotropical murid checklists. Whereas A. lugens (the type species of Aepeomys) was clearly allied with Thomasomys and certain other ''thomasomyines'', fuscatus exhibited equally unambiguous similarities to oryzomyines. Rather than belonging to Oryzomys or other allied genera, however, fuscatus seemed to be a highly divergent form. Handley and RSV compared notes and agreed to collaborate on a joint report, but other projects intervened and only a few colleagues were informed about their results. In the meantime, Guy G. Musser examined the type series of Oryzomys intectus in London, recognized that it represented the same clade discovered by Handley and RSV, and generously provided them with copies of his notes; RSV followed this up by examining intectus himself on a subsequent visit to the Natural History Museum. Other independent discoveries of essentially the same facts about fuscatus and intectus were made by MGL and VP; their results were based on new specimens and/or new characters (not previously considered by Handley and RSV) , resulting in this collaboration. With the recent death of Charles Handley, it seems appropriate to name the new genus for him in recognition of his past participation in our work and in tribute to his many important contributions over the course of a long and productive career in Neotropical mammalogy ( fig. 1 ). CONTENTS: Two species as redescribed below. MORPHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS AND DESCRIP-TION: Adult body pelage fine and soft, uniformly dull brownish-gray dorsally, usually darker (sometimes almost blackish) middorsally than on flanks; ventral pelage dark gray frosted with paler gray or buff, not sharply countershaded. Mystacial, superciliary, genal, submental, interramal, and carpal vibrissae present; mystacial hairs neither very short nor very long, extending posteriorly to (but not beyond) caudal margins of pinnae when laid back against cheeks of properly made-up skins. Pinnae not large but clearly visible above fur of head, sparsely covered with short dark hairs. Manus sparsely covered dorsally with short pale (whitish or silvery) hairs; ventral surface naked and unpigmented, with five separate plantar tubercles (two carpal and three interdigital pads); claws short, neither conspicuously elongated nor unusually recurved. Pes long and narrow, with outer digits (I and V) much shorter than middle three (claw of dI extending to middle of first phalange of dII, claw of dV extending just beyond first interphalangeal joint of dIV); conspicuous ungual tufts of long silvery hairs rooted at bases of claws on dII-dV, but pedal dorsum otherwise only sparsely covered with short pale or dark-banded hairs; plantar surface (including heel) naked, weakly pigmented (grayish in life), with two metatarsal and four interdigital pads; indistinct squamae (scale-like tubercles) sparsely distributed along outer distal plantar surfaces, but not in center of sole. Tail about as long as combined length of head and body, (ICN 16092) . Distinctive characteristics of the genus include the narrow, hairless sole; six small plantar pads including thenar (t), hypothenar (h), and four interdigital (1) (2) (3) (4) tubercles; very short hallux (I); long and subequal second (II), third (III), and fourth (IV) digits; short and nonopposable fifth digit (V); indistinct plantar squamae (sq); and ungual tufts of long hairs rooted at the bases of the claws of digits II-V. apparently naked (a sparse caudal pelage is only visible under magnification), and unicolored (dark above and below). Mammae six in inguinal, abdominal, and postaxial pairs.",

Gall bladder absent (in two dissected specimens of H. intectus). Phallic and other male reproductive characters undetermined. KARYOTYPE: Gardner and Patton (1976: table 2) reported a diploid number (2n) of 54 chromosomes and a fundamental number (FN) of 62 from three karyotyped specimens of Handleyomys fuscatus (USNM 507267-507269); both the X and Y chromosomes are submetacentrics (op. cit.). COMPARISONS WITH AEPEOMYS: As recognized prior to this report (e.g., by Musser and Carleton, 1993; Ochoa et al., 2001) , the genus Aepeomys contained four other nominal taxa in addition to fuscatus: lugens Thomas (1896) , vulcani Thomas (1898) , ottleyi Anthony (1932), and reigi Ochoa et al. (2001) . Of these, ottleyi has long been considered a subjective junior synonym of A. lugens (see Osgood, 1933) , an assessment with which we completely agree. Aepeomys reigi, however, is a valid species distinguished from A. lugens by subtle but consistent morphological characters and by its highly distinctive karyotype (Ochoa et al., 2001 ). The fourth nominal taxon, vulcani, is based on a partially crushed holotype (BMNH 98.5.1.10) that exhibits none of the distinctive attributes shared by A. lugens and A. reigi; as independently determined by C.O. Handley, Jr. (personal commun.) and VP (in prep.), vulcani is referable to the genus Thomasomys (sensu stricto), wherein its possible synonymy with other nominal taxa remains to be determined.",

Flanking the base of the rostrum on each side of the skull in Handleyomys is a shallow but welldefined zygomatic notch formed by the free anterodorsal margin of a broad, more-or-less vertically oriented zygomatic plate. By contrast, the zygomatic notches are indistinct in Aepeomys because the zygomatic plate is slender and slopes posterodosally without a free anterodorsal projection. The interorbital region is hourglass-shaped (concave-sided in dorsal view) with rounded supraorbital margins in both taxa ( fig. 9A, B ), but this part of the skull is relatively narrower in Handleyomys, a consequence of its less inflated frontal sinuses and olfactory bulb.

The first maxillary molar of Aepeomys is relatively longer and narrower than the shorter, broader M1 of Handleyomys, and the unworn labial cusps (paracone and metacone) of M1-M2 in Aepeomys are much taller and sharper than their homologs in Handleyomys. With increasing toothwear, the principal molar cusps of Aepeomys persist as distinct tubercles, whereas the molar cusps of Handleyomys are quickly worn down to form a common planar surface with other occlusal features. Differences in the length and orientation of the principal labial and lingual flexi are also striking. In Aepeomys, the internal segments of the major labial folds (paraflexus and metaflexus) are oriented anteroposteriorly down the midline of M1-M2, and the lingual flexi (protoflexus and hypoflexus) are shallow; longitudinal (rather than transverse) enamelled crests are therefore prominent in these teeth. By contrast, the principal labial flexi of Handleyomys slant transversely across the midline of the tooth to interpenetrate with much longer lingual flexi, resulting in the morphology that Voss (1993: 20) termed ''incipient lophodonty''. The unworn anterocone of M1 is deeply divided by an anteromedian flexus in Aepeomys, whereas the M1 anterocone is undivided in Handleyomys. Corresponding differences are apparent in the lower molars as well ( fig.  7 ).",

The stomachs of both genera are unilocular (single-chambered), but gastric glandular epithelium in Aepeomys is restricted to a small, pouch-like structure on the greater curvature (closely resembling the condition illustrated by Carleton [1973: fig. 5C ] for Oxymycterus rutilans). By contrast, the entire right half (antrum) of the stomach is lined with glandular epithelium in Handleyomys (closely resembling the hemiglandular condition illustrated by Carleton [1973: fig. 2D ] for Zygodontomys brevicauda). A large and distinct gall bladder is present in a cleft between the left and right halves of the cystic lobe of the liver in Aepeomys (as previously reported by Voss, 1991: table 4) , but both dissected specimens of Handleyomys lack a gall bladder. COMPARISONS WITH ORYZOMYS: Even excluding intectus, the genus Oryzomys remains a morphologically heterogeneous collection of species that defies meaningful diagnosis. Because several systematic studies have recently suggested that Oryzomyseven in its strict modern sense (Musser and Carleton, 1993) -is not monophyletic (see Myers et al., 1995; Steppan, 1995; Weksler, 1996; Bonvincino and Moreira, 2001) , we base our comparisons on a small group of taxa that appear to be closely related to the type species, O. palustris (Harlan). This core concept of Oryzomys essentially corresponds to Goldman's (1918) palustris group and additionally includes O. couesi (Alston), O. dimidiatus (Thomas) , O. gorgasi Hershkovitz, and other possibly valid species currently regarded as synonyms of O. couesi (see S\u00e1nchez et al., 2001 ). In the following paragraphs we use Oryzomys in this narrowly defined sense, acknowledging that additional genera must eventually be named to contain at least some of the many other species currently referred to this long-abused taxon. Carleton and Musser (1989) provided detailed illustrations and descriptions of many morphological traits of O. palustris that should be consulted for additional details of characters mentioned below.",

However, species of Melanomys differ from Handleyomys by their coarser, glossier, more richly colored (usually chestnut-or reddishbrown) pelage; relatively shorter tail (LT \u03fd HBL); shorter hindfeet with blackish soles and large, almost-naked claws; mammary complement of eight teats; relatively shorter rostrum; relatively broader, convergent-beaded interorbit; relatively much narrower parapterygoid fossae; highly derived (pattern 3) carotid circulation; lack of subsquamosal fenestrae; and narrower, nonlophodont molars (see Goldman [1918 Goldman [ , 1920 for descriptions and illustrations). In fact, we have not found a single trait in which Melanomys and Handleyomys resemble one another that is not also shared with many other small oryzomyines. Prima facie, they do not appear to be closely related. Ellerman (1941: 341) astutely noted the ''highly aberrant dentition'' of Oryzomys intectus with respect to other congeners, and remarked that ''. . . this species should, I think, be transferred to the genus Nectomys.'' Although the incipiently lophodont molars of Handleyomys (figs. 6, 7) and Nectomys (see Hershkovitz, 1944: fig. 4; G\u00f3mez-Laverde et al., 1999: fig. 4 ) are a noteworthy point of shared-derived resemblance, these genera are dissimilar in most other respects. Species of Nectomys are much larger rats (adult HBL \u03fe 160 mm) that differ from Handleyomys in many external and craniodental traits, including their coarser, glossier, water-repellent fur; relatively longer tail (LT \u03fe HBL); very large hind feet with prominent plantar squamae, well-developed interdigital webbing, and naked claws (Hershkovitz, 1944: fig. 2c, d) ; mammary complement of eight teats; relatively shorter rostrum; much deeper zygomatic notches and correspondingly broader zygomatic plates; convergent-beaded inter-orbit; highly derived (pattern 3) carotid circulation; and lack of subsquamosal fenestrae. That Ellerman did not, in fact, transfer intectus from Oryzomys to Nectomys probably resulted from the lack of supporting evidence from other (nonmolar) characters.",

Handleyomys likewise has only six teats (lacking pectoral mammae), but the phylogenetic interpretation of this similarity is ambiguous. Six mammae are thought to represent the plesiomorphic condition among Neotropical sigmodontines (according to the ingroup and outgroup assumptions explained by Voss, 1993: 12) , so the shared possession of this primitive feature by Scolomys and Handleyomys suggests that these genera might be basal to an oryzomyine radiation of eight-mammate taxa. Alternatively, if Scolomys and Handleyomys are descended from an oryzomyine ancestor with eight teats, their shared loss of pectoral mammae provides evidence of a sister-group relationship. Obviously, distinguishing between these (and other) alternatives is impossible in the absence of a comprehensive analysis of oryzomyine phylogeny, but it is relevant that no other special similarities suggest a close relationship between Scolomys and Handleyomys.",

External measurement means appear to be similar from the two cordilleras, but we did not apply statistical tests because specimens were measured in the field by many different persons (including inexperienced undergraduates) using unknown protocols. We used one-way Analyses of Variance, however, to test for sample differences in craniodental measurements, all of which were taken by us using identical methods. No significant differences were found between cordilleran samples in Condylo-incisive Length, Length of Diastema, Breadth of Incisive Foramina, Breadth of Palatal Bridge, and Zygomatic Breadth. Other craniodental measurements showed statistically significant differences, but some of these are not empirically compelling (e.g., BM1 and LIB, with mean differences \u03fd 0.01 mm). The most visually obvious differences indicated by these tests are in Length of Nasals (already scored as a qualitative trait; table 2, fig. 12 ), and Interparietal Breadth. Although the latter measurement exhibits slight overlap between western and central Andean specimens (8.2-10.2 mm versus 6.2-8.8 mm, respectively), the mean morphological difference is obvious when skulls are viewed side-by-side ( fig.  15 ). Contrasts between western and central Andean skulls in Molar Length, Length of the Incisive Foramina, and Breadth of the Zygomatic Plate are visually subtle in some pairwise comparisons of local population samples but visually conspicuous in others (see below).",

In general, morphometric distances between geographic samples from the same cordillera are smaller than distances between samples from different cordilleras, a pattern that can be heuristically summarized by cluster analysis ( fig. 16 ). Because some sample sizes are small, clustering sequences determined by small differences in computed distances (e.g., within the central Andean cluster) are probably not biologically significant, and some large values (e.g., between Valle del Cauca and Western Risaralda) might be artifactually inflated. Nevertheless, the substantial estimated mean distance between western and Central Andean samples (ca. 6.5 within-sample multivariate standard deviations) reinforces the conclusion previously based on qualitative character data that these mountain ranges are occupied by morphologically differentiated populations of Handleyomys. A valid criticism of cluster-analytic summaries of geographic variation is that hierarchical patterns are forced on data that may not, in fact, be hierarchically structured (de Queiroz and Good, 1997) . In particular, discontinuous variation (as resulting from speciation) cannot be distinguished by cluster analysis from intraspecific clinal variation without taking the geographic distribution of the analyzed samples into consideration (op. cit.). Intraspecific clinal variation is not, however, a plausible explanation for our results, because geographic and morphometric distances are not correlated in Handleyomys. The Quind\u00edo/eastern Risaralda sample, for example, clusters with geographically distant samples from Antioquia rather than with the geographically adjacent sample from western Risaralda (just across the Cauca valley). Nevertheless, it is possible that such geographically proximate but morphometrically divergent populations of Handleyomys might show some degree of intergradation.",

The first two principal components account for about 75% of the total variance (table 5). Projected specimen scores ( fig. 17) indicate complete sample separation on the first component, the coefficients of which suggest that La Suiza specimens differ from El Campamento specimens by their longer incisive foramina, narrower zygomatic plates, longer nasals, and narrower interparietals (essentially the same pattern of morphometric divergence previously identified by our univariate comparisons of central versus western Andean series).

Whereas specimens from Valle del Cauca average larger than specimens from western Risaralda in several dimensions (e.g., CIL, LD, LIB, ZB, IPB), the same specimens have absolutely and relatively smaller incisive foramina (LIF, BIF), more slender zygomatic plates (BZP), and shorter nasals (NL).

DISTRIBUTION: All referred specimens of Handleyomys intectus are from the central Andes (Cordillera Central) of Colombia between 1500 and 2800 m above sea level in the departments of Antioquia, Quind\u00edo, and Risaralda. EMENDED DIAGNOSIS: A species of Handleyomys distinguished by hindfeet that are usually covered dorsally by pure-white (or indistinctly pigmented) hairs; nasals that usually extend posteriorly well beyond the pre- (B, ICN 16079) . In H. intectus, the interparietal (ip) is narrow (transverse dimension) relative to its depth (antero-posterior dimension), and the flanking sutures between the parietal (par) and exoccipital (exo) are extensive. By contrast, the interparietal of H. fuscatus is broad relative to its depth, and the parietal-exoccipital sutures are correspondingly shorter.

Frequent mists, high annual precipitation (2600-3500 mm), and high relative humidity (77-95%) characterize the local climate, which includes a short dry season from December to February and a longer wet season from May to October (op. cit.). The local topography is complex, . . . dissected by steep river valleys and gorges. Primary forests are characterized by a heterogeneous canopy, from 6-7 m on the ridges, 15-17 m on the slopes, increasing to 20 m along watercourses, with occasional emergent trees up to 30 m. Understorey cover is densest on the steep slopes, dominated by terrestrial herbaceous plants and by epiphytes on ridges. The forests are particularly dynamic, with a high natural treefall rate and landslides caused by high precipitation on steep slopes with shallow soils. (Cuervo et al., 2001: 361) Carlos A. Delgado V. collected seven specimens of Handleyomys intectus at this site between 7 and 11 January 2001. The an-imals were taken in Sherman live traps set in mature forest festooned with bromeliads, ferns, moss, and orchids; no specimens were taken in traps set along the forest edge or in clearings. Traps that took H. intectus at La Forzosa were placed on the ground among the elevated roots of palms and other trees, beneath the large leaves of low-growing understory plants, and inside rotting logs. All captured individuals apparently entered the traps at night. Sympatric rodents trapped at the same locality included Heteromys australis (voucher: ICN 16072), Rhipidomys latimanus (ICN 16087, 16088) , Oryzomys albigularis (ICN 16084-16086) , and Melanomys caliginosus (ICN 16080-16083) . fig. 12: locality 12) is a protected area in the valley of the R\u00edo Ot\u00fan on the western slope of the Cordillera Central. Although the biological station at La Suiza is surrounded by pastures, agricultural fields, and alder (Alnus acuminata) plantations, some primary cloud forest (''bosque muy h\u00famedo Montano Bajo'' of Espinal and Montenego, 1963 ; including large specimens of Quercus humboldti) persists along the nearby Quebrada La Hacienda and on surrounding hillsides. Local rainfall is bimodally distributed, with average monthly maxima in June (237 mm) and November (290 mm); January is the driest month on average (121 mm), and the mean annual total is 2038 mm (Aguilar and Rangel, 1994) . The median annual temperature is about 24\u040aC, with average daily maxima and minima of 33\u040a and 16\u040a, respectively (op. cit.).",

The equipment used on both visits consisted of medium-size (ca. 80 \u03eb 90 \u03eb 230 mm) Sherman live traps, large (ca. 100 \u03eb 115 \u03eb 380 mm) Sherman live traps, and small snap traps (Museum Specials), all of which were placed on the ground and similarly baited. Traplines were located along the margins of forest clearings, along narrow trails through the forest, and along the banks of Quebrada La Hacienda. Altogether, these faunal-sampling efforts amounted to 1163 trap-nights, of which 603 were in February and 560 in June. Handleyomys intectus was the most commonly trapped species at La Suiza on both visits, accounting for 50% of total captures (table 8) . All trapped animals were re-covered at dawn and appeared to have been captured during the previous night.",

Above 2500 m, however, is an extensive landscape of primary cloud forest (''bosque muy h\u00famedo Montano Bajo'' of Espinal and Montenegro, 1963) that is protected by the Parque Nacional Natural Tatam\u00e1. The ICN base camp at Los Planes was an abandoned shelter about an hour and a half by mule from finca Las Delicias (ca. 2100 m) via a dirt road that parallels the R\u00edo San Rafael. Collections were made just inside the park boundary, about 500 m above the south bank of the river, in a zone of transition between the denuded lower slopes and the primary forest. The eastern slopes of Tatam\u00e1 are said to have a median annual temperature of about 17\u040aC and an annual precipitation of 2000-2800 mm; precipitation is bimodal, with maxima in May and October-November and minima in February and July (S\u00e1nchez-P\u00e1ez et al., 1991) .",

However, terrestrial habits are consistent with inferences based on morphology: the long-narrow hindfoot of Handleyomys (with short, nonopposable outer digits; fig. 3 ) resembles the condition seen in many other murids with betterdocumented terrestrial behavior (e.g., Amazonian species of Oryzomys; see Malcolm [1991] , Patton et al. [2000] , and Voss et al. [2001] for relevant trapping data). By contrast, semiarboreal and arboreal muroids typically have shorter, broader hindfeet with longer outer digits, of which dV is often semiopposable (Voss et al., 2001: fig. 53B, C) . The relatively short, naked-appearing tail of Handleyomys is another indication of terrestrial locomotion because arboreal murids usually have relatively longer tails with longer, coarser hairs that sometimes form a terminal tuft (Voss et al., 2001: fig. 61 ). Lastly, the dull, drab pelage of Handleyomys is similar to that of many other nocturnal montane murids and contrasts with the more richly pigmented fur of some taxa that are known to be active in the daytime (e.g., Scotinomys, NO. 3373 AMERICAN MUSEUM NOVITATES Melanomys; Hooper and Carleton [1976] , Gardner [1983] ). Other aspects of the natural history of Handleyomys are obscure. No noteworthy dietary information is available; only a few ectoparasite records have been published (Brennan, 1968) ; nesting sites, litter sizes, and gestation lengths are unknown; and data from year-long trapping programs are not available to assess reproductive seasonality. Obviously, the absence of concrete information about so many biological details provides considerable scope for productive future fieldwork on these animals.",

Therefore, the absence of specimens from large collections obtained by general trapping programs can be taken as a plausible indication that the genus does not occur in the region(s) where such collections were made. It is not likely, for example, that Handleyomys occurs in the cloud-forested mountains along the Panamanian frontier (Serran\u00eda de Pirre, Serran\u00eda del Dari\u00e9n), because these highlands have been repeatedly visited by mammalogical collectors (Anthony, 1916; Goldman, 1920; Pearson, 1939; Handley, 1966 Handley, , 1972 . Similarly, sizable collections have accumulated over the years from many forested (or formerly forested) localities surrounding Bogot\u00e1 in the eastern Andes (Cordillera Oriental) of Colombia (material that we examined is in the AMNH, BMNH, FMNH, IAvH, ICN, MLS, and USNM), and from the vicinity of Quito in the Andes of northern Ecuador (representative material examined is in the fig. 12 ) was the focus of intensive general collecting in the late 19th and early 20th centuries (Bangs, 1900; Allen, 1904) , and the Cordillera de M\u00e9rida (in western Venezuela) is mammalogically familiar territory (Handley, 1976; P\u00e9faur and D\u00edaz de Pascual, 1985; Durant and D\u00edaz, 1995; Soriano et al., 1999a Soriano et al., , 1999b .

Although these negative results might be overturned by more intensive faunal sampling at some future date, they all tend to support the prima facie conclusion from known records of positive occurrence that H. fuscatus might be narrowly endemic to the central part of the western Andes and H. intectus to the northern part of the central Andes.",

Possibly, some paleoecological connection between cloudforest habitats in the central part of the western Andes and those in the northern part of the central Andes might be discovered by palynological sampling in the R\u00edo Cauca valley. A more compelling research goal for systematic mammalogists, however, is to evaluate the generality of the biogeographic pattern described above. Is Handleyomys the only mammalian clade with this distribution, or can others be identified among the several genera and species complexes of sympatric small mammals that remain to be revised taxonomically?
