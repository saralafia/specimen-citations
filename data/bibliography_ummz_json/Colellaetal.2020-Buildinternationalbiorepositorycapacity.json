In most countries, natural history biorepositories remain poorly supported and largely disconnected from public health initiatives. For example, most studies of bat coronaviruses to date (5), including the PREDICT animal surveys discussed in Watsa et al., did not preserve host specimens or tissues, thus limiting the potential for molecular host identification or replication and extension of the science (6) . Emerging infectious disease response hinges on sampling depth across space, time, and taxonomy, the very sampling enabled by museum biorepositories. As primary biological infrastructure, in-country development of museum collections that follow best practices (7), with specimen data freely available through the internet, should be an international imperative (8) A shared risk perspective could also combat the narratives that portray animals as dangerous pests or disposable commodities that endanger human health (5) , as in the case of bats (6), many of which are likely not hosts for coronaviruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (7). In addition to emphasizing shared risk, such misinformation can be countered with well-researched messaging following a zoonotic outbreak. Conservation social science has honed a suite of tools to identify the often unpredictable human motivations behind (8) , and the possible negative consequences of, such communications (9) .",

Some natural history museums and zoos archive biobanked specimens, cryopreserved viable cell cultures, disease specimen banks, and histopathology samples, but this highly effective practice (10) is limited by high costs. We agree that devoting funding toward biodiversity banking within countries at high risk for emerging infectious diseases would improve conservation outcomes. Taxonomically diverse biobanked tissues and live cell cultures could expand studies of host-pathogen relationships, clarifying host range or affected tissues and providing in vitro systems for infectivity and pathogenicity investigations. Such collections could allow drug development for humans to expand beyond just a few animal laboratory models, given that relatively well-studied viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 are potentially broadly infectious across taxonomic orders (11) . Comparative genomics and transcriptomics among nonmodel species are used infrequently in biomedical research programs but hold great potential for prioritizing species and gene targets with alternative host defense mechanisms for laboratory study (12) .",
