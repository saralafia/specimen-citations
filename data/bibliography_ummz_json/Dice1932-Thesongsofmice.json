Several months later, in March, 1926, Mr. Clark gave this musical mouse to the University of Michigan for study. It was a typical Mus musculus. Attention was called to the mouse by his habit of song, and he was said by Mr. Clark to sing particularly loudly when being pursued, and his location was thereby at all times evident, facilitating his capture. Such a habit would evidently be a disadvantage to an animal pursued by a predator able to hear the song, and natural selection would probably tend to eliminate individual mice with the singing habit.",

On some occasions the song could be clearly heard at a distance of 25 feet or even more, but more commonly it did not carry distinctly more than about ten feet. Generally the song consisted of a series of pleasing musical chirps and twitters, but there was considerable variation in the notes and tones produced as well as in the volume. A trained musician, Mrs. Martha Grim, found the tones not pure, but much mixed with overtones, so that the determination of the precise pitch of any note was not usually possible. However, the notes could easily be heard by the human ear, and the range was at least two octaves. The number of notes per second varied between two and six or more. No particular theme could be recognized; consequently the song was somewhat monotonous.",

On the other hand, the mouse would often run actively about in his cage without making the least audible sound; so it seems that the song could not have been due to a pathological condition of the vocal organs, as has been suggested by some authors (Barrett-Hamilton and Hinton, 1921, p. 657) .

In both of these cases the so-called singing was apparently kept up constantly, and in the case of Landois' mouse during both inspiration and expiration. From the meager descriptions of these mice at hand it seems that their songs were not like those described for most other singing mice. A pathological condition of the respiratory tract might well cause the production of sounds, and probably the \"songs\" of some mice have been 'due to this cause. The songs of many mice, however, are, apparently under the voluntary control of the animals, and although the vocal apparatus may possibly be abnormal in structure there is no obvious diseased condition.",

Many of the offspring resulting from these back-crosses had the same characteristic chitter noted in the first generation, but there was no improvement due to back-crossing. These later generations were more wild than normal laboratory mice, because of the heavy percentage of wild ancestry introduced by the male, and for this reason apparently produced the chitter less reliably than the mice of the strain which was not back-crossed. Offspring of matings between the three times back-crossed mice and the not back-crossed line, did not produce any song resembling that of the original male.

Never have I heard anything like the songs described by Lockwood and by Hiskey. In general the deer-mice are less noisy than the house mouse, but they do make several vocal sounds. A few of them produce a chitter somewhat like that produced by the house mice, but hoarser, and they assume for this purpose the same posture on the wires of the cage as does the house mouse. Some of the Peromyscus, like the house mouse, assume the posture for the chitter, without producing any audible sound. My attempts to produce a line of Peromyscus with the chitter habit, by breeding from parents selected for the chitter, have resulted in failure. The offspring usually failed to produce the sound.",
