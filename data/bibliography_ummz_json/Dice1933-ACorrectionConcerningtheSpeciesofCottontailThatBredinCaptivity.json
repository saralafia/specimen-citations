    "abstract": "Papers dealing with the natural history of the red tree-mouse, Phenacomys longicaudus, have contributed little or nothing to the subject of enemies of this peculiarly arboreal microtine, with the exception of A. B. Howell's discourse (N. Am.Fauna, No. 48, 1926,pp. 59-60) on probable enemies and adverse factors in the .environment. The small size of litters (two or three in each), even though breeding may occur throughout the year, is conducive to speculation on the question whether as serious a toll is levied upon this species by predators as upon its ground dwelling relatives. Howell (p, 60) states that \"raptorial birds must be the chief active enemy with which these mice have to contend.... ; owls, especially screech owls, would be attracted by the .mice, foraging among the foliage of a tree.\" He records considerable damage to litters of young by Steller jays (Cyanocitta stelleri), On May 26, 1932, I collected a female spotted owl (Stri\u00bb occidentalis courina) at a point on Eel River, ten miles north of Garberville, Mendocino County, California. The bird was taken at about 9 a. m, in a madrone and Douglas :fir wood and had in its stomach a nearly perfect skull of Phenacomys longicaudus, together with much red hair that was at once recognizable as of this species. Mr. S. B. Benson has checked the identification of the skull for me. Since the northwest race of spotted owl is quite characteristic of, and not uncommon in, the Douglas fir and redwood belt of northern coastal California, I surmise that it is as potent an enemy of the tree mouse as is any other species of owl. No actual instances of capture by other owls appear to be known. Screech owls do not seem to be particularly abundant in the region. Spotted owls have been taken a number of times at Mr. H. E. Wilder's place near Carlotta, Humboldt County, California, where much of the natural history information pertaining to Phenacomys longicaudus has been obtained. In my experience spotted owls move about at night within the trees and foliage, not on the tree tops or in the openings in the forest as do horned owls, and hence they would naturally operate within the forage range of this mouse.",

The animals actually were Sylvilagus floridanus alacer, and all references to neomeziconus in the paper cited should be changed to alacer, At the time the paper was prepared most of the rabbits were still alive. Living alacer differs so strikingly from mearnsii or similis in size and behavior that I was misled into believing that my subjects must belong to the species audubonii. As shown by these animals S.f. alacer is smaller and much more active than either S. f. mearnsii or S. f. ",
