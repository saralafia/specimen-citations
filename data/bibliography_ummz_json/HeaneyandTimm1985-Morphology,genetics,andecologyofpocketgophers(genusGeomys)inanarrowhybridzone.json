    "abstract": "A population of hybrid pocket gophers (Geomys bursarius x G. lutesccns) exists 1-2 km west of Oakdale, Antelope County, Nebraska, U.S.A. The hybrids occur in soil that has characteristics intermediate between that occupied by G. lutescens (sand) and by G. bursorim (silt loam); the vegetation associations on the different soils are Sandhills Prairie and Tall-grass Prairie, respectively, with mixed prairie on the intermediate soils. Hybrids are identifiable on the basis of both qualitative and quantitative morphological characteristics, allozymes and karyology. Concordance between morphological, allozymic, karyotypic and ecological data sets is very high. Hybrids appear to reproduce normally and survive well; i.e. they suffer no obvious loss of fitness. Barkcrossing to either parental type is apparently rare. The parental species each support obligate parasitic lirr (Geomydoecus: Trichodectidae) of different species; these species are not sister species. We suggest that hybrid zones resulting from primary and secondary contact may be distinguished by (I) roncordance of clines in different character sets, (2) fossil and biogeographic data, and (3) parasite data. We conclude that this zone resulted from secondary contact, and that the zone is maintained either by selection against hybrids (less likely) or by hybrid superiority (more likely).",

                "text": "Studies of natural hybrid zones occupy an important role in investigating the process of speciation because the degree of genetic and ecological differentiation associated with a speciation event may be studied directly (Templeton, 1981) . Most studies of hybridization between mammal species have concentrated on morphological, karyological, or genetic variation (e.g. Smith, 1979; Greenbaum, 1981 (see also Hafner, 1982) ; Tucker & Schmidly, 1981; Zimmerman, 1982; Patton, Smith, Price & Hellenthal, 1984) ; fewer have investigated the ecological circumstances as well (e.g. Patton, 1973; Gabow, 1975; Nevo & Bar-El, 1976; Patton, Hafner, Hafner & Smith, 1979; Sugawara, 1979; Hafner, Hafner, Patton & Smith, 1983) . Recent modelling suggests that ecological circumstances are important in determining the dynamics of hybrid zones (Endler, 1977; Barton, 1979a, b; Barton & Hewitt, 1981) , and empirical evidence from other vertebrates appears to support this (Moore, 1977) . However, much additional information on the ecology of hybrid zones is necessary before a synthesis of the ecological and genetic processes of hybridization and speciation in mammals is possible.",

Hybridization between the two species (G. bursarius and G. lutescens) has long been suspected and presumed broad-scale intergradation was the basis for previous claims that the two were conspecific (Villa-R. & Hall, 1947; Jones, 1964; Hendrickson, 1972) . However, our studies showed no intergradation in qualitative and quantitative features of cranial morphology, with the exception of a 1 km wide zone in Antelope County, Nebraska, U.S.A. Additionally, Hart (1978) suggested that this was an area of abrupt contact between two karyotypic forms; our subsequent investigations confirmed this (Timm, Hart & Heaney, 1982; Heaney & Timm, 1983) .",

Tissues for electrophoretic studies were removed from fresh carcasses, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored in -70\u00b0C freezers. Some tissues were degraded due to failure of a freezer; for these, only a single clearly scorable locus was analysed, as discussed below. Electrophoretic analysis was conducted in J. L. Patton's laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley, using methods described in Patton, Selander & Smith (1972) , and Patton & Yang (1977) . Specimens were frozen shortly after capture; they were later brushed for ectoparasites, prepared as study specimens, and autopsied for data on reproductive condition. Specimens were deposited in the Field Museum of Natural History (FMNH), Museum of Natural History, University of Kansas (KU), and Museum of Zoology, University of Michigan (UMMZ). All cranial measurements were taken by Heaney with dial calipers to the nearest 0.1 mm; see Heaney & Timm (1983) for definitions. External measurements were taken from specimen labels. Results of discriminant function analyses were taken from Heaney & Timm (1983) . Soil samples were taken directly from mounds at the entrance of tunnels where gophers had been trapped, and were analysed for percentage content of sand, silt and clay. Soil distributions shown in Fig. 1 were taken from Soil Suruey of Antelope County, Nebraska, prepared by the U S . Department of Agriculture Soil Conservation Service. Voucher specimens of plants were deposited in the University of Minnesota Herbarium, St. Paul, and lice were deposited at the University of Minnesota entomological collection, St. Paul.",

To the east lies the Tall-grass Prairie, and to the south and north, Shortand Mid-grass Prairie (Kuchler, 1964 , 1974 . The Nebraska Sandhills were formed during the late Wisconsinan as a result of periglacial winds scouring large areas of glacial alluvium in SW South Dakota and NW Nebraska (Wright, 1970) . In Antelope County, the sandhills are currently bounded on the north by the Elkhorn River and on the south by Cedar Creek. At approximately 13000 to 12 000 years bp, the James River Lobe in South Dakota and the Des Moines Lobe in Iowa began retreating to the north; spruce forest spread rapidly across the sandhills, stabilizing them into their current configuration. Shortly thereafter, the spruce forest was probably replaced briefly by deciduous forest, and then by prairie. Areas to the south and east of the sandhills were covered with spruce forest during the period of dune formation, but changed to deciduous forest and to prairie at about the same time as the sandhills (Wright, 1970) . Geomys bursarius probably spread into the Tall-grass Prairie of E Nebraska from a glacial refugium to the southeast soon after the spread of prairie vegetation into the area; G. lulescens probably had a refugium in the western portion of the central Great Plains, and spread into the sandhills at the time that G. bursarius was dispersing into the present Tall-grass Prairie (Heaney & Timm, 1983) .",

Thirteen of the 53 species of plants identified in the area (see Heaney, 1979) were found solely in sandy soil, and seven others only in sandy soil and loam. Nearly all of the Sandhills Prairie is moderately to heavily grazed pasture, and a high proportion of the flora is made up of weed species. The eastern edge of the sand dune supports a thick stand of bur oak (Quercus macrocarpa) with scattered hackberry (Celtis sp.); this stand is approximately 35 m wide and 500 m long. The areas of intermediate soil are mostly under cultivation, with alfalfa and corn the dominant crops. A small (c. 1 ha) area of currently undisturbed vegetation had the appearance of Mid-grass Prairie. Eleven of its plant species were not found on other soil types, whereas seven also occurred in sandy soil and six in silt loam. The silt loam soils are also mostly under cultivation with alfalfa and corn. Vegetation in a few undisturbed patches was typical of eastern Tall-grass Prairie, with prairie coneflower, field rose, western snowberry and white-eyed grass characteristic species; seven species were not found in other soil types.",

In the loam soil areas, which had intermediate vegetation, gophers intermediate in size, colour, and development of cranial crests were found; hereafter these are referred to as hybrids. Female G. bursarius are larger in all aspects than female G. lutescens or hybrids. The dorsal pelage of G. bursarius is a rich 'chocolate' brown, only rarely having a trace of a mid-dorsal stripe of darker pelage. The pelage of G. lutescens is comparatively pale with a sandy or yellowish cast; a faint to well-developed mid-dorsal stripe is always present. Hybrids have variable pelage; the dorsal pelage is occasionally as light as that of G. lutescens, but never as dark and rich as that of G. bursarius. Hybrids often have a mid-dorsal stripe of varying intensity. Geomys bursarius characteristically has light brown or off-white fur in the cheek pouch, whereas G. lutescens have golden yellow fur in their cheek pouches. Hybrids have light yellowish-brown pocket fur, much like that of some G. bursarius (Table 1) ",

At the centre there is a rapid change from one morphotype to the other, with an apparent continuum of morphotypes present. The change in morphology takes place over a distance of about 1 km, between 0.8 and 2.0 km west of the Oakdale post office. This zone of change is also the area of intermediate soil type (see Fig. 1 and section on habitat selection, below).

The only hybrids that were closely adjacent to either parental species were the two in silt loam soil, southeast of Cedar Creek (Fig. 1) and we found no indication of direct contact between the parental species.

All of the pocket gophers captured in the 15 ha of loamy soil were hybrids, indicating that any backcrossing that occurs takes place outside the partially isolated main population of hybrids.

Thus, the embryo and scar counts listed in Table 2 represent yearly reproductive output for gophers from the central Great Plains. The difference between the embryo and scar counts for G . lutescens (3.0 versus 3.75) indicates that roughly 20% post-implantation uterine mortality is normal. The mean embryo and scar counts from hybrids are equivalent to Geomys from other areas; the presence of one resorbing embryo out of nine is not unusual. All seven other adult female hybrids showed signs of reproductive activity: two were lactating, two had enlarged uteri, and three had an undertermined number of old scars. We conclude that the hybrids reproduce successfully, and that there is no evidence for conspicuously reduced fitness. Although occasional backcrossing seems inevitable, it is unlikely that hybrids often mate with either parental species because of the short distances they normally travel (by burrowing) to find mates (Smolen et al., 1980) , and because of the barriers between most hybrids and G. bursarius (Cedar Creek) and between the hybrids and G. lutescens (the forested edge of the sand dune, described above). In short, the hybrids appear to form a self-sustaining population not significantly dependent on immigration or outbreeding for continued existence.",

However, one hypothesis has been advanced that yields different predictions for the two modes of origin, and we suggest here two additional discriminators. Barrowclough (1980) and Hafner et al. (1983) have argued that primary differentiation is likely to involve a single character system. Thus, they predict little concordance in clines in different character systems. They then argue that secondary contact is likely to produce zones with concordant cline mid-points and widths. However, Barton (1979b) has independently shown that clines of primary differentiation are likely to move in response to density and/or selection gradients, so that concordance of clines becomes likely, We accept Barton's conclusion, but point out that concordance should be viewed as a probability function. When the clines originate in geographic proximity (relative to the dispersal ability of the organisms), the probability of concordance is high. When clines originate progressively more distantly, the probability of concordance becomes progressively less. Thus, if two populations show little variation over several thousand 'dispersal distance units', and there is a sharp cline between them, primary differentiation seems unlikely.",

The width of any cline ( w ) is conventionally estimated as the distance between points where the populations are about 80% parental type, i.e. where individuals average 20% 'foreign' in a given characteristic (e.g. Endler, 1977; Barrowclough, 1980; Hafner et al., 1983) . All of our estimates of cline width yield w equal to about 1 .O km. If we adopt the conventional estimate of 0.1 km per generation for gene flow in pocket gophers (Hafner el al., 1983; Patton, 1984) , the resultant calculated value for 7is 35 generations. At about 1.5 years per generation, this is 53 years. If the gene flow value ( I ) is estimated at 0.5 km per generation, which is the maximum likely value (Hafner et al., 1983; Patton, 1984) , then T = 1.4 generations ( = 2 years). Both of these estimates are not only far shorter than the likely post-Pleistocene contact time of 8000 years for these species, they are shorter than the known duration of 90 years. This implies that some factor has acted to restrict the size of the hybrid zone in its present configuration, i.e. that it is not a 'neutral diffusion' situation.

However, zoologists have generally paid it less attention. Moore (1977) discussed the model thoroughly and gave several examples; it assumes that within the hybrid zone, hybrids have fitness greater than or equal to that of the parental types and that positive assortative mating occurs in all three populations. This type of zone is most likely to occur in habitats intermediate between the habitats of the parental types, especially in ecotones, and in new habitats, often those caused by man (i.e. disturbance areas) (see Moore, 1977) . Introgression is prevented by selection against hybrids outside the zone. For such a zone to exist, any parental type inside the zone must be at a selective disadvantage, and so the proportion of parental types within the zone should remain low.",

Second, under the hybrid inferiority hypothesis, it is likely that isolating mechanisms would be selected for, and the zone would eventually disappear entirely. Under the superiority hypothesis, the hybrid population should persist indefinitely. Our data again point to the superiority model as more likely because of the apparent age of the zone, but we do not regard the evidence as conclusive.",

At least six individuals from 0.6-2.0 km west of Oakdale have FNs intermediate (75-82) between the parental types. Because of the high variability in FN present in the parental populations of G . lutescens, it is not possible to say whether karyotypically intermediate individuals are F , hybrids, backcrosses, or are part of a breeding population of hybrids.",
