    "abstract": "Fossil primates have been known from the late middle to late Eocene Pondaung Formation of Myanmar since the description of Pondaungia cotteri in 1927. Three additional primate taxa, Amphipithecus mogaungensis, Bahinia pondaungensis and Myanmarpithecus yarshensis, were subsequently described. These primates are represented mostly by fragmentary dental and cranial remains. Here we describe the first primate postcrania from Myanmar, including a complete left humerus, a fragmentary right humerus, parts of left and right ulnae, and the distal half of a left calcaneum, all representing one individual. We assign this specimen to a large species of Pondaungia based on body size and the known geographic distribution and diversity of Myanmar primates. Body weight estimates of Pondaungia range from 4,000 to 9,000 g, based on humeral length, humeral midshaft diameter, and tooth area by using extant primate regressions. The humerus and ulna indicate that Pondaungia was capable of a wide variety of forelimb movements, with great mobility at the shoulder joint. Morphology of the distal calcaneus indicates that the hind feet were mobile at the transverse tarsal joint. Postcrania of Pondaungia present a mosaic of features, some shared in common with notharctine and adapine adapiforms, some shared with extant lorises and cebids, some shared with fossil anthropoids, and some unique. Overall, Pondaungia humeral and calcaneal morphology is most consistent with that of other known adapiforms. It does not support the inclusion of Pondaungia in Anthropoidea. T he first fossil primate described from Myanmar was Pondaungia cotteri Pilgrim in 1927 (1) from a locality near Pangan (Pankan) village in the Pondaung Formation of central Myanmar (formerly Burma). Ten years later Colbert (2) described Amphipithecus mogaungensis from near Mogaung village in the Pondaung Formation. No other primates were reported from the Pondaung Formation over the next 42 years until four new specimens were discovered at Mogaung in 1978 (3-5). Several new specimens of primates have been reported subsequently from the two earlier areas along with specimens from new localities near Bahin, in the Pondaung Formation (5-9). Mogaung localities are middle Eocene (late Lutetian to early Bartonian) while localities near Pangan and Bahin are late middle (late Bartonian) to late (Priabonian) Eocene (10). A Bartonian age for localities in the Bahin area is supported by a fission-track date of 37.2 \u03ee 1.3 mega-annum (Ma) on zircon crystals from a tuffaceous bed that outcrops at several localities (35). Primates known from Myanmar include at least four taxa, the original two species plus Bahinia pondaungensis (7) and Myanmarpithecus yarshensis (36). An additional species of Pondaungia, P. minuta [holotype NMMP (National Museum of Myanmar Primate) 4] was proposed by Jaeger et al. (6), and another species of Amphipithecus, ''A. bahinensis'' (NMMP 7) was informally cited by Thein (8). Jaeger et al. (6) questioned the distinctiveness of A. bahinensis, instead regarding it as A. mogaungensis, while Takai et al. (5) have questioned the validity of P. minuta, a species based on a heavily worn and eroded specimen.",

In April 1997 this team discovered new fossil localities in the Bahin area ( Fig. 1 ) that led to the recovery of the first complete jaw of Amphipithecus mogaungensis now designated NMMP 7. At this point, an invitation was made to one of us (R.L.C.) to mount a joint Myanmar-American field project to the Bahin area. On December 26, 1997 members of this international team discovered the first primate postcrania in the Pondaung Formation at a locality less than 2 km from Yarshe kyitchang where NMMP 7 was found ( Fig. 1 ).",

Field collecting at a locality about 4 km NW of the village of Bahin (Fig. 1 ) resulted in the discovery of some associated postcranial elements (NMMP 20) of a relatively large-bodied primate (11) . These remains had eroded from a dark red-brown mudstone on a small hillock undistorted by local dipping. The local name for this locality is Sabapondaung kyitchang; it also has been cataloged as Pk1 (see figure 5 in ref. 12) . We have assigned these postcrania to Pondaungia as it is the largest of the four primate genera now known from the Bahin area ( Fig. 2) . Pondaungia is also the most common primate in the Pondaung Formation, representing 50% of the 20 primate specimens recovered to date. NMMP 20 includes a nearly complete left humerus, missing only fragments of the supinator crest, a right humerus with a complete proximal end, a portion of the shaft, and a broken distal end, a right proximal ulna preserving the distal part of the trochlea and the radial articular surface, a left proximal ulna preserving the olecranon process and proximal trochlea, the distal half of a left calcaneum, two other long bone shaft fragments, and a fragmentary vertebral centrum (Figs. [3] [4] [5] .",

The shape of the humeral head is rounded and broad, resembling extant Cebus but unlike Nycticebus, where the head is tapered proximally and distally. The proximal extension of the head is similar to that in extant Nycticebus (16) and North American middle Eocene notharctines (Notharctus and Smilodectes). The head extends farther proximally than in Cebus and differs from extant lemurs and Egyptian Oligocene Aegyptopithecus where the head and greater tuberosity extend nearly equidistant proximally ( Fig. 3 A,  B , F, and G). The head angles proximally more so than in Nycticebus, Smilodectes, or Aegyptopithecus, about as in extant Pondaungia postcrania, which is based on humeral length and humeral midshaft diameter (13, 14) .",

Although Pondaungia is similar to Adapis and Nycticebus in some morphological features, especially of the calcaneum, interpretations of other postcranial elements of Pondaungia do not provide evidence to support this interpretation. Other morphological features, especially that of the distal humerus, suggest that Pondaungia was more like fossil notharctines, primates interpreted to have been arboreal, leaping quadrupeds like extant lemurs (16, 29) .",

Table 3 summarizes some humeral and calcaneal comparisons of Pondaungia with some extant and extinct primate taxa. Humeral morphology is a mosaic of lorisine, cebid, omomyid, and notharctine character states with only the proximal humerus showing any unequivocally derived conditions (proximally rotated head, reduced deltopectoral crest). It is clear that Pondaungia is not closely allied with cebids or lorisines. Pondaungia has previously been aligned with notharctines on the basis of dental features (30) . At present it is difficult to determine whether any of the notharctine-like features of the Pondaungia humerus are apomorphic within primates, but among the various competing hypotheses of the phylogenetic position of Pondaungia, the evidence from this element is more consistent with Pondaungia being a closer relative of notharctines than being a stem anthropoid. Recent claims of anthropoid status for Pondaungia (9) are not supported by the known postcranial evidence. Humeral and calcaneal morphology is entirely inconsistent with the hypothesis that Pondaungia is a catarrhine (6, 31, 32) .",

The only postcranial character state that Pondaungia shares in common with Fayum anthropoids is a strong supinator crest, but this is also shared with notharctines. Recent phylogenetic analyses of dental features have aligned Pondaungia and Amphipithecus with propliopithecine catarrhines (6, 31) , but it is now clear that the known postcrania of Pondaungia are entirely at odds with this hypothesis. This evidence indicates to us that, unless the lineage leading to Pondaungia underwent a number of highly unlikely morphological reversals, this genus cannot be nested within the clade containing Eocene-Oligocene anthropoids from the Fayum. This, in turn, implies that the dental features aligning Pondaungia with propliopithecine catarrhines are functional convergences, for late Eocene Fayum taxa such as Proteopithecus exhibit a much more primitive dental morphotype but already exhibit typically anthropoid postcrania (18, 33) and complex anthropoid apomorphies such as postorbital closure (34) . Whether the anthropoid-like dental features of Pondaungia are derived from a dental morphotype like that of notharctines, that of eosimiids, or that of primitive Paleogene Afro-Arabian anthropoids remains to be determined. Given the emerging cranial and postcranial fossil evidence from the late middle Eocene of Myanmar, however, it now appears that the possible notharctine, or at least adapiform, affinities of Pondaungia and its close relatives once again deserve serious consideration. The discov-ery of this associated partial skeleton draws attention to the importance of further fieldwork at the various Myanmar localities with the objective of finding combined dental, cranial, and postcranial remains that may be relevant to the question of anthropoid origins.",

These Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates mark the precise location of each specimen. The Yarshe and Pk1 localities, depicted as patterned ovals in B, represent the areal extent of the outcrops used to produce the measured stratigraphic sections presented in C and D. Age of Amphipithecus in C is based on micropaleontological samples and inferred nannozone assignment as well as vertebrate faunal associations. Age of Pondaungia postcrania in D is inferred by faunal comparisons with other localities in the Bahin area. No micropaleontological samples suitable for analysis have been found in D. However, a tuffaceous layer recently found in this section has been dated by fission-track (35) and confirms a Bartonian age for the Pondaungia postcrania. Nearby locality Pk2 in B has recently yielded a new dentary of Pondaungia sp nov. (37).",

Distally, Pondaungia humeri share less in common with lorises and cebids and are instead more similar to middle Eocene notharctine adapiforms. The rounded capitulum and the distinct gutter separating the capitulum and trochlea are found in notharctines. Platyrrhines such as Cebus and Saguinus have distinct trochlear gutters but their capitula are less rounded. The trochlea is deep medially and tapers laterally as in notharctines and Nycticebus, but differs from the more cylindrical trochlea found in omomyids and extant anthropoids. The large, rounded, distally extended capitulum of Pondaungia is shared with arboreal quadrupedal leapers such as lemurs and cheirogaleids",
