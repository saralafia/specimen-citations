Explanations for their present distribution patterns vary, invoking historical scenarios that stress vicariant events, dispersal events, or some combination of these two processes (Davis and Brown, 1989; Lomolino et aI., 1989; McKee, 1941; Patterson, 1984; Sullivan, 1985) . For example, all three hypotheses have been offered to account for the fragmented distribution of the tassel-eared squirrel (Sciurus aherti), a prominent spe-cies in conifer forests of the Rocky Mountains Disjunct populations of S, aberti were traditionally considered to be vicari ant relicts of a widespread, essentially continuous distribution within a vast Pleistocene coniferous forest (McKee, 1941) . Increasing aridity during the Holocene caused the coniferous forest and its contingent of squirrels to fragment, forming remnant montane populations (McKee, 1941) . A competing view suggests that post-Pleistocene dispersal, including extensive migration across unsuitable habitat, accounts for much of the present distribution of S. aberti (Davis and Brown, 1989) . A third view holds that there was an inceptive vicariant component from which major dispersal ensued during the Pleistocene and continued post-Pleistocene to the present (Lomolino et aI., 1989) .",

An alternative assessment involves examining genetic structure of populations, whose pattern and magnitude may reveal clues to historical demographic and biogeographic events. In particular, variation among mitochondrial-DNA (mtDNA) haplotypes can be used to associate intraspecific phylogenies with geographic distribution. Variation in mt-DNA examined in this context forms the basis of intraspecific phylogeography, which can be broadly defined as the processes that govern geographic distributions of genealogical lineages (A vise et aI., 1987) . A phylogeographic approach often allows the detection of, and distinction between, past demographic conditions (dispersal) and historical environmental disjunctions (vicariance). Here we report the phylogeography of S. aberti based on variation of mtDNA detected by restriction-site analysis. We compare phylogeographic structure in mtDNA of S. aberti with competing biogeographic predictions based on late-Pleistocene vicariant versus dispersal events. In this respect, our survey provides important baseline data regarding a genetic approach to the biogeographic history of the montane mammalian fauna in the American Southwest. The mtDNA lineages uncovered in our survey also allow comparisons to subspecific designations for S. aberti. Our data complement and extend recent molecular surveys by Wettstein et al. (1994 Wettstein et al. ( , 1995 , which examined variation of mtDNA to establish a temporal framework for the evolution of the major histocompatibility complex and T-cell receptor genes in S. aberti (Wettstein and States, 1986a, 1986b; Wettstein et aI., 1990) .",

The dietary selectivity of the squirrel is underscored by preferences for particular target trees that exhibit significantly lower levels of oleoresin monoterpenes and reduced rates of xylem flow (Snyder, 1992) . Squirrels also rely on pines for cover, and although individuals occasionally are observed in other habitats, reproducing populations are restricted to forests of ponderosa pine (Hall, 1981; Keith, 1965) . The close ecological ties of squirrels to host trees are clearly revealed in their discontinuous, although largely coincident, distributions in montane settings from southern Wyoming to northern Durango, Mexico. It should be noted, however, that S. aberti is absent from the majority of ponderosa pine forests, which are widespread throughout western North America (Little, 1971) . The discrepancy in respective ranges indicates that this herbivore-host relationship does not involve reciprocal dependency.",

Samples of liver were stabilized in MSB-EDTA buffer (Lansman et aI., 1981) within 10 min of collection and held at 4\u00b0C for 2-7 days before processing. About 1 g of liver was homogenized in fresh MSB-EDTA buffer, from which closed-circular mtDNA was isolated by CsCI-gradient centrifugation (Lansman et aI., 1981) . Purified samples of mtDNA were digested separately with the 18 informative endonucleases listed in Table 2 . Samples also were digested with Bam HI, but this enzyme proved uninformative (Le., generating either one or no restriction fragments), and these data were not included for analysis. Digestion fragments were end-labeled with 35S-dNTPs, separated through 1-1.8% agarose gels, and revealed by autoradiography. Restriction-site changes involving small fragments (200-600 bp) were confirmed using 2.5-3.5% Nusieve GTG aga- Distinct restriction profiles for each endonuclease were identified by an uppercase letter code, with \"e\" designating the most common profile. Each squirrel was assigned a composite genotype of mtDNA (its haplotype or clonal designation) compiled from the restriction profiles across all enzymes. Size polymorphism was negligible, and differences in patterns of fragments could be readily attributed to transformations involving simple losses or gains of specific restriction sites. Inferred site data for the genotypes were assembled in a presence-absence matrix, and estimates of nucleotide-se- quence divergence (P) between genotypes of mtDNA were calculated by the site approach of Nei and Li (1979) . method using arithmetic means (UPGMA), using p-values as input matrix to the NJOIN and SAHN programs. respectively, of NTSYS-pc (Rohlf, 1992) . In addition, maximum-parsimony analysis of the restriction-site data was conducted using the branch-and-bound search procedure",

Once established, however, the pines soon became abundant, dominating the Chaco Canyon site by ca. 6,700 years ago and the Abajo Mountains by ca. 7,200 years ago (Betancourt, 1990) . It is apparent that ponderosa pine experienced a rapid expansion in the Holocene from the south, and although a refugium has yet to be confirmed (Anderson, 1993) , the species likely was \"an important component of montane communities in the highlands south of 35\u00b0 [N] , and probably was most prevalent in the Sierra Madre Occidental\" (Betancourt et aI., 1990:443) . Ponderosa pines presumably reached their present distribution via long-distance dispersal or island hopping during the early Holocene (Betancourt et aI., 1990) . Genetic data for Great Basin populations of Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) support a similar pattern of rapid post-glacial expansion northward (Betancourt et aI., 1991; Schnable et aI., 1993) .",

Indeed, the data from middens suggest that about one-third of the present range was uninhabitable during the Wisconsinan glaciation. Additional evidence against the role of post-Pleistocene vicariance in shaping phylogeographic structure in S. aberti is apparent when the maximumparsimony tree (Fig. 3 ) is compared to a geographical, or area cladogram (sensu Kluge, 1988) . Sullivan (1994) the American Southwest. The area c1adogram that Sullivan (1994) generated for this region depicts the fragmentation sequence of biotic communities from the late Wisconsinan to the present, thereby providing a hypothesis for genetic differentiation among populations of S. aberti sundered by the fragmentation of contiguous pine forests. Figure 4 illustrates the method for constructing an area c1adogram for a series of hypothetical mountain ranges. Range A, separated from other ranges by the lowest elevation, is the first to become isolated and thus forms the lowest branch of the cladogram. Range C is the terminal taxon, the last to sever connections to other ranges. However, ranges Band E are unresolved in the cladogram (despite the fact that they represent different geographic areas) because both experienced isolation at the same elevation. Thus, it is not possible to distinguish cladistically between them; such unresolved nodes cannot be compared using the criteria outlined by Kluge (1988) .",

First, it is nearly impossible to avoid unresolved nodes in any vicariance model for montane organisms. If the elevation limits of biotic communities are altered by climatic change, then coincident fragmentation of geographically disparate mountain islands is inevitable. Second, our vicariance model makes biological assumptions that undoubtedly are violated, most notably that biotic communities are predictable at given elevations. Elevationallimits for both modern and paleo-communities are approximations at best, as local edaphic and microclimatic conditions often support communities that would not otherwise be predicted by elevation (Betancourt et aI., 1990; Pase and Brown, 1994) . For example, at ca. 34\u00b015' and 2,100 m, Rocky Mountain-montane-conifer forest occurs on and below the Mogollon Plateau, but grassland dominates the Plains of San Agustin, New Mexico, which in tum is surrounded by montane-conifer forests of the Rocky Mountains at slightly higher elevations. In other instances, sites separated by low elevations might actually be connected via canyons that support communities associated with higher elevations. Thus, sites that are connected or separated in our area cladogram by objective criteria might not conform with apparent limits imposed by elevation. However, none of this precludes resolution of these conflicts with additional evidence (sensu Kluge and Wolf, 1993) , How do these caveats temper an interpretation of our vicariance hypothesis? The distribution of S. aberti encompasses several mountain ranges whose montane-conifer forests would have been isolated at about the same elevation and time period, yielding an area cladogram with several unresolved nodes (Fig. Sa) . As a result, we cannot compare on a fine scale, i.e., range by range, the level of concordance between the area cladogram and the phylogeny from maximum-parsimony analysis. In broadscale comparison, however, the area cladogram and maximum-parsimony tree display substantial topological discordance (Fig. 5) . First, the maximum-parsimony tree reveals two major assemblages of mtDNA, partitioned east and west, but there is nothing in topology of the area cladogram that predicts an east-west split. Moreover, terminal lineages of the maximum-parsimony tree such as the haplotypes Kaibab Plateau and Sierra Ancha should form basal branches accroding to our geographical hypothesis. Thus, our mtDNA data falsify the hypothesis predicted by our model and indicate that post-Pleistocene vicariance was not a major factor in the evolutionary genetics of S. aberti.",

Davis and Brown (1989) argued that S. aberti dispersed across woodland (non-ponderosa pine) barriers or along corridors in a northward expansion roughly contemporaneous with that of the island-hopping pines during the late Wisconsinan-early Holocene. Lomolino et al. (1989) offered strong support that similar dispersal across woodland barriers at this time played a central role in determining geographic distribution of several montane-forest mammals in the American Southwest. These studies suggest that many of the populations of squirrels in OUf survey derive from a substantive northward wave of dispersal. What aspects of the mtDNA data are consistent with, or have bearing on, a dispersal-dominated history for S. aberti in its northern range? Diversity of haplotypes does appear greater below 36\u00b0N than above (14 haplotypes versus seven) despite a comparable number of sampling locales (11 versus 10). This distribution pattern of haplotypes is consistent with a recent, rapid, range expansion, where effective population size (N e ) and thus diversity of haplotypes of the dispersal contingent are expected to be reduced proportionally.",

Our data speak more clearly to the subspecies S. a. aberti, S. a. chuscensis, and S. a. kaibabensis. According to Hoffmeister and DiersiIig (1978) , S. a. aberti comprises all populations of the Mogollon Plateau, populations in western New Mexico (exclusive of the Chuska Mountains), populations in the San Juan Mountains (formerly S. a. mimus), and populations in the Abajo Mountains-Elk Ridge (formerly S. a. navajo). As presently defined, S. a. aberti includes haplotypes from both eastern and western assemblages, although these respective clones do not OCCur sympatrically. Our data suggest distinct evolutionary histories for the two assemblages, and therefore, challenges the validity of a single S. a. aberti composed of such highly divergent genetic lineages. The distribution of the eastern haplotype contingent of S. a. aberti is largely coincident with the western range of the former subspecies s. a. mimus. Sciurus a. chuscensis also is characterized by haplotypes from both the eastern and western assemblages. However, it differs from the situation for S. a. aberti in a most important respect, and, in fact, provides an empirical example of a rare phylogeographic outcome; one in which pronounced phylogenetic discontinuities (i.e., distinct haplotypes) occur without spatial separation. One tenable explanation for such a pattern involves secondary contact between allopatrically evolved assemblages or geographic races (Avise et aI., 1984) . Admixture of divergent eastern and western haplotypes in the Chuska Range (Chuska Mountains, Defiance Plateau), which lies between 35-36\u00b0N in northeastern Arizona, is consistent with the northern expansion of (and presumably secondary contact between) eastern and western assemblages. Did the contact zone in the Chuska Mountains involve the dispersal of squirrels of the eastern assemblage into a western-assemblage resident population, or vice versa? It is interesting to note that S. a. chuscensis is represented by one western haplotype (g), which differs from other western haplotypes by a single site loss, and by two eastern haplotypes, one differing by a single site gain (k) and the other identical to the haplotype in the Zuni Mountains (j). Thus, minimal divergence of nucleotides observed between the haplotypes in the Chuska Range and their respective assemblages indicate that none have undergone extended isolation in the Chuska Range, and that dispersal of eastern and western ancestral forms to this region may have been roughly contemporaneous. In the absence of nuclear gene markers or morphological indices, conclusions about the extent and direction of mitochondrial gene flow are compromised. A future survey analyzing both nuclear and mitochondrial genes is required to fully disclose patterns of dispersal and introgression in the Chuska Range.",

Confined to the Kaibab Plateau, S. a. kaibabensis originally was described as a separate species (Merriam, 1904) and for years served as a standard example of aIIopatric speciation in college biology texts (e.g., Hardin and Bajema, 1978; Keeton, 1980; Wallace et aI., 1981) . Nash and Seaman (1977) summarized the available literature for S. aberti and continued to recognize S. kaibabensis. More recently, the tenor of the example has been altered, stressing population differentiation in response to geographic isolation (e.g., Campbell, 1993; McFadden and Keeton, 1995) . Both explanations identify an ancestral population sundered by regional events that formed the Grand Canyon and subsequently gave rise to distinctive northern (kaibabensis) and southern (aberti) rim forms.",

                "text": "However, disparate lines of evidence suggest that populations of S. aberti from the Grand Canyon area probably were not in position, spatially or temporally, to have been separated by formation of the Canyon (ca. 4-5 X 10 6 years ago- Lucchitta, 1979) . To reiterate, evidence from packrat middens from the Wisconsinan glaciation demonstrates that ponderosa pines were absent from the southcentral Colorado Plateau, including the Grand Canyon, until ca. 10,300 years ago (Betancourt, 1990; Cole, 1990) . Thus, without a base of ponderosa pines, it is unlikely that the Kaibab Plateau could have sustained an isolated population of S. aberti. In addition, S. a. kaibabensis exhibits limited morphological change relative to populations of S. a. aberti. Hoffmeister and Diersing (1978) stressed that cluster analysis of cranial and external characters revealed little, if any, differentiation between specimens from the Kaibab Plateau (n = 20) and those from the Coconino and Mogollon plateaus (n = 88). Moreover, dark-bellied specimens are observed in other parts of the range, and white-bellied individuals are occasionally sighted on the Kaibab Plateau (Hoffmeister and Diersing, 1978) . Wettstein and States (1986a) have suggested that variation in coat color may involve a single gene, like the agouti locus of Mus, and that aberrant color patterns in S. aberti might result from new retroviral insertions, just as those reported in mice (Jenkins et aI., 1981) .",

With just two unique site changes, the Kaibab haplotype, i, exhibits minimal divergence (p = 0.004) from others in the western assemblage. One would anticipate a p some 20-fold higher (p = 0.090) than the observed value, had an ancestral Kaibab population persisted in continuous isolation following the inception of the Grand Canyon. Complementing the distance analyses, the maximum-parsimony tree depicts the Kaibab haplotype lying well within the western clade. As noted previously, the Kaibab haplotype shares a unique HindIII site gain with haplotype h (in effect, a synapomorphy) found in four of the six individuals from the Coconino Plateau (i.e., South Rim of the Grand Canyon) sample. Collectively, the genetic, morphologic, and paleoclimatic data offer strong support for a late-Pleistocene origin for S. a. kaibabensis via northward dispersal from central Arizona.
