At that time, while surveying mammals near Chumbicha, Catamarca Province, on a field trip with the first author, R. Ojeda collected a specimen that was tentatively identified as an undescribed species of Andalgalomys and extended the known distribution of the genus 150 km to the southeast. Although the distance from the type locality of A. olrogi was not great in kilometers, there were great differences in habitat. The animal was not captured in Monte Desert vegetation, but was in a different biorne, the Chaco, or Great Thorn Forest, a region that supports a mammal fauna distinct from the Monte (Ojeda and Mares, 1989) . Since that time, a number of additional specimens have been collected that support the idea that these pertain to a third species of Andalgalomys and extend the range of the genus southward in central Argentina. In this paper, we describe a new species and extend the range of the genus >500 km to the south of Andalgahi, and into the Chacoan thorn scrub of central Argentina.",

At closer observation hairs are dark neutral gray basally for ca. 5-6 mm followed by an ca. 3-4 mm band of cream buff. Occasionally these hairs may have black tips. Guard hairs are dark neutral gray basally with black tips. Cream buff hairs on the sides have gray bases. The sides are paler than the dorsum, because the hairs lack the black tips, and because the gray-black guard hairs are absent. The venter is white to the base of the hairs. The dorsal surface of the tail is Saccardo's umber to sepia brown and the ventral side is paler, smoke gray to light grayish olive. The subauricular spots, postauricular patches, and tops of the feet are white. The white venter is sharply delineated from the dorsum. The area around the nares and mouth is white. The tail is longer than the length of head-body and ranges from 85 to 135 mm; it is brownish above, whitish below, and moderately penciled, with the hairs ex- tending ca. 5 mm beyond the tip. The basal two-thirds of the tail are moderately haired (scales visible to the naked eye); the distal one-third is well haired, and the scales are not visible. The hairs increase in length toward the tip of the tail, giving the appearance that the tip of the tail is darker in color. The ears range from 17 to 23 mm, the inner surface is clothed with yellowish-brown hairs. The outer surface is sparsely covered with yellowish-white hairs, except for a 4 mm-wide band on the anterior edge that is covered with dark-brown hairs. The hind feet range from 21 to 25 mm, the soles are naked, with six separate, medium-sized plantar pads. External measurements are listed in Table 1 .",

Adult males captured at Chumbicha in July (n = 3) had abdominal testes measuring 3 by 1.5 mm (n = 2) and 5 by 2 mm (n = 1). An adult female captured at Pampa de las Salinas in March had an open vagina. This female had six mammae arranged in three pairs (pectoral, abdominal, inguinal) . An adult and subadult female collected at Pam\"' pa de las Salinas in May were not reproductively active (closed vaginas). A third female was pregnant and gave birth to five young in the trap; four survived and were placed in the animal-care facility at the Laboratorio de Reproduccfon y Lactancia, Mendoza, Argentina. No reproductive data are available for an adult female captured at Chumbicha in July or for a subadult female collected in November. Steppan's (1995) inclusion of Andalgalomys within Graomys based on a cladistic analysis of morphological data, we here detail our reasons for retaining Andalgalomys as the genus of record for the new species. There are trenchant morphological differences between Andalgalomys and Graomys that appear to justify continued generic separation (Olds et al., 1987; Williams and Mares, 1978) . Unfortunately, a number of these autapomorphies were not included in the analyses of Steppan (1995) , yet they are the very characteristics that help to define the differences between the genera-species of Andalgafomys exhibit these characters and species of Graomys do not. These characters include: a whitish subauricular spot; laminate upper molars; large palatal slits formed by the fusion of palatine foramina; a small notch on the postcingulum of Ml; a small, anteriorally directed anteroloph of M2 (Olds et al., 1987; Williams and Mares, 1978) .",

Under every scenario, only one minimum-length tree was produced-Andalgalomys was the sister taxon to a clade formed by both species of Graomys (supporting the generic distinctiveness of both Andalgalomys and Graomys). Moreover, the original data matrix of Steppan (1995) and the information presented in his text are not always in agreement, or in agreement with observations reported by other investigators. For example, in his specimen-character matrix, the alisphenoid strut is said to be present in Andalgalomys; however, Olds et al. (1987) and our own examination of specimens found this feature to be absent. The characters describing the neural spine. of the second cervical vertebra are shown as missing for Andalgalomys in the data matrix, but they are described in detail in the text. Steppan (1995.) reported that the opposing flexi of M3 are variable for both species of Graomys, but the data matrix does not reflect any such polymorphism.",

Heuristic approaches, while necessary when datasets are large, do not produce optimal trees (Swofford and Olsen, 1990) . The standard approach (and the approach used by Steppan,) 1995 has been to produce consensus trees, but the use of such trees as a basis for classification has been widely criticized (Carpenter, 1988; Miyamoto, 1985) . While consensus trees reflect areas of agreement among trees, they generally provide a less parsimonious explanation of the original character data. For both of the published analyses of Steppan (1995) of the tribe Phyllotini, the consistency and retention indices are low (CI = 0.22 and 0.30; RI = 0.55 and 0.58; a consistency index of 1.0 would indicate perfect agreement among trees). This would suggest that actual relationships of taxa may not be resolved. Investigators must resist the temptation to treat consensus trees as phylogenies, for they are not. Additionally, phylogenetic relationships have been shown to be negatively affected by the presence of missing data (Wilkinson, 1995a (Wilkinson, , 1995b . In the analyses of, Steppan (1995) 9.2 and 8.2% of the data were missing for G. domorum and A. pearsoni, respectively. Whether such missing data affected the results of the Andalgalomys-Graomys clade is impossible to determine, but such an occurrence is possible.",

We recently described a new genus and species of desert phyllotine (Salinomys delicatus) from the scrub forests surrounding saline flats in westcentral Argentina (Braun and Mares, 1995) ; Salinomys and A. roigi co-occur. The discovery of yet another new species of rodent from xeric scrublands in northwestern Argentina underscores how poorly the mammals of these drylands are known. We are familiar with few areas likely to yield such diversity of new taxa. Moreover, this was the second time in northwestern Argentina that we had collected more than one new species in the same locality (with different species, and possibly a different undescribed genus). Mares (1992) discussed the fact that drylands of South America were quite rich in mammals, particularly at higher taxonomic levels, when considered from the point of view of endemism. Since 1975, a 45-kg peccary (Wetzel et aI., 1975) and new genera of rodents (e.g., Braun and Mares, 1995; Hershkovitz, 1993; Williams and Mares, 1978) have been discovered in the diverse dry lands of South America. These regions are extensive and have had great orogenic upliftings resulting in the formation of numerous isolated valleys, extensive montane \"islands,\" and complex interdigitations of major habitats. For a zoologist, this area is an exciting region in which a complex evolutionary story remains to be described.",
