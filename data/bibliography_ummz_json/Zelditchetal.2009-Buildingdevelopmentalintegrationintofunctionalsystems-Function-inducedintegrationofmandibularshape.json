    "abstract": "The mammalian mandible is a developmentally modular but functionally integrated system. Whether morphological integration can evolve to match the optimal pattern of functional integration may depend on the developmental origin of integration, specifically, on the role that direct epigenetic interactions play in shaping integration. These interactions are hypothesized to integrate modules and also to be highly conservative, potentially constraining the evolution of integration. Using the fox squirrel (Sciurus niger) mandible as a model system, we test five a priori developmental hypotheses that predict mandibular integration and we also explore for correlations between shapes of mandibular regions not anticipated by any of the developmental models. To determine whether direct epigenetic interactions are highly conserved in rodents, we examine the correlation structure of fluctuating asymmetry, and compare integration patterns between fox squirrels and prairie deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus bairdii). In fox squirrels, we find a correlation structure unanticipated by all a priori developmental models: adjacent parts along the proximodistal jaw axis are correlated whereas more distant ones are not. The most notable exception is that the shape of the anterior incisor alveolus is correlated with the shape of the ramus (FA component) or coronoid (symmetric component). Those exceptions differ between species; in prairie deer mice, the molar alveolus is connected to more parts, and the incisor alveolus to fewer, than in fox squirrels. The structure of integration suggests that the mandible cannot be decomposed into parts but rather is a single connected unit, a result consistent with its functional integration. That match between functional and developmental integration may arise, at least in part, from function-induced growth, building developmental integration into the functional system and enabling direct epigenetic interactions to evolve when function does.",

                "text": "Developmental and functional couplings among traits are widely viewed as the primary causes of morphological integration at the individual level, shaping the patterns of stabilizing selection that direct the evolution of morphological integration at the population level (e.g., Cheverud 1982 Cheverud , 1996a Wagner 1996; Wagner and Altenberg 1996) . In theory, it does not matter whether the couplings are developmental or functional in origin because it is only their impact on the pattern of stabilizing selection that matters. And the two causes of coupling sometimes match each other so precisely that it is virtually impossible to separate function from development because developmental modules are functional modules. That matching appears to be characteristic of the mammalian skull, a classic model system for studies of morphological integration (Cheverud 1982 (Cheverud , 1996b Zelditch and Carmichael 1989; Marroig and Cheverud 2001 ; e.g., Ackermann and Cheverud 2004; Hallgr\u00edmsson et al. 2004; Goswami 2006b) . The skull can be viewed as a collection of functional modules that each serve a specific biological role, such as respiration, vision, or olfaction; these have been termed ''functional matrices,'' which comprise the soft tissues and the skeletal components that protect and support the soft tissues (Moss 1968; Moss and Salentijn 1969) . These modules are grouped into more inclusive units that interact epigenetically, perhaps due to spatial packing constraints (Ross and Ravosa 1993; Bastir et al. 2006; Lieberman et al. 2008) . In light of the functional coupling between soft and skeletal tissues, the adaptive value of a variant skeletal trait, such as a relatively large cranial vault, depends on the phenotype of the associated soft tissue, such as the brain. This dependence is also developmental because the form of the skeletal tissue depends on the growth of soft tissues. It is the ability of bone to receive and adaptively respond to mechanical signals that integrates these functionally coupled tissues, maintaining optimal proportions despite variation in their individual sizes. Functional integration is thus built into the developmental system.",

That simplicity is belied by the mandible's developmental complexity; each of the paired bones comprising the mandible arises from seven mesenchymal condensations, six of which give rise to the structures of the adult. Because mesenchymal condensations exemplify developmental modules (Atchley and Hall 1991; Hall and Miyake 2000; Hall 2003) , the mandible can be viewed as a highly modular developmental system. Yet, it is a functionally integrated one. While the mandible serves three primary functions (mastication, gnawing and ingestion), parts of the jaw cannot be divided up according to a single function they serve, and the functions are not anatomically localized. That the mandible is functionally integrated could be inferred from the fact that measures of chewing or gnawing performance, e.g., mechanical advantage of the masseter muscle, are ratios. Because they are ratios, the adaptive value of one dimension depends on the phenotype of the other. Thus, under stabilizing selection we would expect the functionally significant ratios to be maintained at their optimal value, predicting that they should be correlated. Not surprisingly, the mandible has been a model for an integrated, complex morphology (Atchley and Hall 1991) , raising still unanswered questions about causes of morphological integration.",

Direct interactions, such as the partitioning of a cell population or signaling interactions between developmental pathways, maintain the internal coherence of developmental modules. Parallel variation refers to a factor that affects the development of two or more traits, acting in parallel along two or more pathways. Integration due to direct interactions is thought to be exceptionally difficult to modify by natural selection because that could entail restructuring developmental pathways; in contrast, selection for favorable pleiotropic effects should be readily accomplished (Klingenberg 2004 (Klingenberg , 2005 . Thus, whether the optimal pattern of functional integration can evolve may depend on the developmental origin of integration. For that reason, in our analysis of the structure and causes of integration herein, we examine both overall integration and that component arising from direct interactions.",

We found that none of the available developmental models effectively predicts the structure of mandibular integration in that species and we hypothesized that integration arises from the spatial distribution of masticatory strains. But it is obviously premature to reject all available hypotheses based on a single case. We therefore reconsider those same models in our analysis of fox squirrels. Fox squirrels and deer mice differ substantially in body size, jaw morphology and ecology, including diet. Whereas prairie deer mice are relatively small-bodied (ca. 12-20 g) grassland rodents, fox squirrels are relatively large (ca. 800-1,000 g) arboreal rodents that typically feed on nuts, pine cones and bark. Our samples also differ in that the deer mice are lab-born animals, reared on Purina mouse chow, and sacrificed just on reaching sexual maturity; consequently, their muscles scars are barely visible and their incisors show little wear. In contrast, the fox squirrels were sampled from a natural population, are three to four year old adults, and their muscle scars are pronounced and their incisors are heavily worn. As well as testing a priori hypotheses, we explore the observed correlation structure for patterns unanticipated by the models and we compare the two species to determine whether the structure of direct interactions might be highly conserved in rodents.",

All measured individuals are full adults with complete dentitions; based on tooth wear, they range from 3 to 4 years old. Because mandibles could not be split into right and left halves, the complete jaw was photographed three times, in standard orientation, repositioning it between photographs, to ensure that our assessment of measurement error includes error due to projecting this three-dimensional structure onto a two-dimensional photographic plane. Sixteen landmarks were digitized on each jaw ( Fig. 1 ). Because these 16 points provide little information about the curvature of the jaw, additional points were used to measure the curves along the incisor alveolus, ventral ramus and all three mandibular processes. These additional points (semi-landmarks) are not discrete anatomical loci and contain less information than landmarks because their spacing along each curve is arbitrary; that variation is removed in the course of the superimposition (see below). However, semilandmarks make it possible to study complex curving morphologies where landmarks are sparse.",

A high density of points is needed to model the shape of the curve accurately, which is part of the process of superimposing semi-landmarks. These were superimposed by estimating the tangent to the curve at each semilandmark, then sliding the semi-landmark toward the normal of its respective tangent, minimizing the overall difference from the reference (Sampson et al. 1996; Andresen et al. 2000; Bookstein et al. 2002; Adams et al. 2004; Sheets et al. 2004) .

Consequently, correlations between random deviations from bilateral symmetry, i.e., correlated fluctuating asymmetries (FA), cannot result from parallel variation but must come from direct interactions. The analysis of fluctuating asymmetry (FA) for geometric shape uses the standard two-factor mixed-model analysis of variance, with ''individual'' and ''sides'' as the two main factors (Leamy 1984; Palmer and Strobeck 1986) , Symmetric variation among individuals is quantified by the main effect of ''individuals'' after correction for asymmetry; the consistent difference between sides (directional asymmetry) is quantified by the main effect of ''sides.'' The interaction between the two main factors estimates the random deviations from bilateral symmetry, i.e., FA. The statistical significance of FA is assessed by the F-ratio between the interaction and measurement error mean squares (Leamy 1984; Palmer and Strobeck 1986) . This approach has been adapted to analysis of shape using Procrustes-based methods (Auffray et al. 1996; Klingenberg and McIntyre 1998; Klingenberg et al. 2002) . We test the statistical significance of FA using a permutation test. Analysis of FA was conducted in Sage (Marquez 2007b) , which also calculates the shape coordinates for the symmetric and FA components of shape that are used in subsequent analyses.",

When both partitions show the same pattern of shape differentiation among individuals, the two matrices should be closely associated, yielding a statistically significant matrix correlation. Conversely, when variation in one partition is not associated with variation in another, the two will differ in their structures of variation, and the distances will not be associated, yielding a matrix correlation near zero.

The ramus is a discrete module arising from a cell population that differentiates to form osteoblasts and (when needed for repair) primary chondroblasts. Another expectation of this hypothesis is that the strength of integration among mandibular processes will vary because the coronoid process originates within the mass of the temporalis muscle and is therefore predicted to be less tightly correlated with the condyloid and angular processes than they are with each other (Atchley et al. 1985; Atchley and Hall 1991; Cheverud et al. 1991; Cheverud 1995) .",

Rather than postulating that muscle-loading can affect a whole process, this model proposes that muscles affect only the local region where they insert. Thus, a single mandibular jaw process will comprise more than one module when more than one muscle inserts on it, as in the case of the angular on which both the internal pterygoid and superficial masseter insert. This model also predicts that two mandibular processes could comprise a single module should the same muscle insert on both (Badyaev et al. 2000 (Badyaev et al. , 2005 Badyaev and Foresman 2004) . This hypothesis makes no predictions about integration elsewhere, thus, interpreted strictly, there are no predictions regarding dental alveoli or regions along the mandibular processes where no muscles insert. We cannot test that strict formulation of the hypothesis because our partitions typically span more than a single muscle insertion site. Had we partitioned both coronoid and condyloid so that each partition contained a single insertion site, much of the jaw would not lie within any partition and only information about local curvature would be contained in the data. Thus, our formulation of the hypothesis does not strictly follow that of Badyaev and colleagues. Instead, we predict that parts on which the same muscle inserts will be correlated even if the part spans more than a single insertion site.",

First, as indicated by low cophenetic correlations, the dendrograms produced by hierarchical clustering do not fit the data well. The cophenetic correlation is the correlation between the original correlation matrix (transformed into a distance matrix) and the matrix of distances between objects produced by the clustering method (Sneath and Sokal 1973) . If the distances between objects on the dendrogram represent the data well, the correlation is 1.00; values of 0.85 or lower are usually regarded as indicating poor fit. The highest values are obtained when clustering is done by UPGMA (Farris 1969) , but the cophenetic correlations produced by UP-GMA for our data are merely 0.845 and 0.753 (for symmetric and FA components, respectively). Second, our data appear to be only moderately hierarchical, as estimated by the agglomeration coefficient (AC). This metric ranges from zero to one, and is high when the first traits merged into clusters are far more similar to each other than the last merged objects (Kaufman and Rousseeuw 1990) . A clustering method like Ward's (1963) should produce high ACs because the method yields tight, spherical clusters, but the ACs resulting from Ward's clustering of our data are only 0.411 and 0.344 (for the symmetric and FA components, respectively).",

The basic model is that variation is determined by latent (i.e., unobserved) variables that affect two or more observed variables, plus a latent variable unique to each observed variable (including both the biological factors unique to that variable and unique measurement error). There can be general factors that affect all the variables and others that affect only subsets of them. The objective is to find the latent variables by extracting linear combinations of the observed traits, and, to the extent that latent variables are regarded as real biological factors, to infer their biological identity from the loadings of the observed variables on the factors. The identification of underlying causes can be greatly complicated by the infinite number of equally valid solutions. Unlike principal components analysis, factor analysis has no unique solution. The results can depend heavily on several methodological decisions such as the method chosen for estimating the communalities of the variables (which are estimates of the common variance to explain), the criterion used to decide on the number of factors to extract, the choice of rotation (which can be oblique or orthogonal), and if orthogonal, whether to simplify the factors or the observed variables or both. Another serious problem is the often ad hoc nature of the causal interpretation, which is derived from the perceived latent structure rather than articulated a priori as a causal theory from which predictions are derived and rigorously tested (Zelditch 1987) . Moreover, just because the analysis produces a factor, it does not mean that the cause is a latent variable that is linearly related to the observed variables or even an observed variable. Despite these serious limitations, factor analysis can be a useful heuristic for exploring the correlations in the data, and for determining whether there are multiple independent suites of traits that correspond to biologically interpretable units.",

The search was not restricted to decomposable models, meaning that is did not consider only graphs that can be partitioned into pairwise disjoint subsets. In light of our small sample size, we used an F-test to determine whether an individual edge is significant; to assess the overall fit of the model we used the model deviance, which is a likelihood ratio test of the specified model against the null hypothesis of the fully saturated model, with degrees of freedom equal to the number of excluded edges.

To assess the generality as well as the goodnessof-fit of the model, we fit it not only to the symmetric and FA components of fox squirrels, but also to deer mice. Although there is no general agreement on the optimal measures of model fit; one standard measure is the likelihood ratio test, as discussed above. This value is a function of the difference between the observed correlation matrix and the expected matrix on, i.e., the one implied by the model. One unappealing feature of this measure is that when sample sizes are large, even fairly small differences between observed and expected matrices can yield large and significant values, and therefore indicate poor fit.

Analyses were done using Mx (Neale et al. 2003 ), a versatile program for statistical modeling that can evaluate models fitted to correlation as well as covariance matrices (available at http://www.vcu.edu/mx). Because we analyzed correlation matrices, we standardized the parameter estimates to remove the variances of the variables (by forcing all the diagonals to equal one).

For the symmetric component, the two fit very well (v 2 = 27.72, d.f. = 47; v 2 = 28.48, d.f. = 47 for the graphs shown in Fig. 6a , b, respectively) and they dramatically improve upon the null model of ''no integration'' (Deviance = 95.8, d.f. = 55). The differences between the graphs involve connections from the dental alveoli to the ramus, more specifically, whether the posterior incisor alveolus is connected to the ramus through the molar alveolus (Fig. 6a) or is instead, adjacent to it on the graph (i.e., directly connected, Fig. 6b ). Both models agree on the edges between proximal and distal parts of coronoid, between proximal and distal parts of the condyloid and between the two parts of the incisor alveolus. They also agree on the edge linking proximal incisor alveolus to molar alveolus and the edges linking proximal condyloid, ramus and anterior incisor alveolus to the proximal coronoid. They further agree that the two parts of the angular are conditionally independent of each other and all other parts, as is the condyle. Both graphs suggest that, with the exception of the connection between the anterior incisor alveolus and proximal coronoid, parts not adjacent to each other are conditionally independent. However, not all adjacent parts are conditionally dependent. The two graphs representing relationships among parts of the FA component also fit well (v 2 = 34.25, d.f. = 48, 36.92, d.f. = 48 for the graphs shown in Fig. 6c, d , respectively) and they dramatically improve upon the null model of ''no integration'' (v 2 = 76.29, d.f. = 55). Most of the discrepancies between these graphs involve the dental alveoli and ramus, more specifically, whether the anterior and posterior parts of the incisor alveolus are linked to each other, which of them links to the molar alveolus and ramus, and whether the ramus links to the proximal coronoid or proximal condyloid. Like the graphs for the symmetric component, those for FA show connections between the proximal and distal parts of the coronoid and condyloid and a connection between the proximal parts of these two processes. They also show the same conditional independence of the two parts of the angular and the condyle. They differ from the symmetric component graphs in that the dental alveoli do not connect to the proximal coronoid, and the ramus may connect to the proximal condyloid rather than the proximal coronoid. Despite these differences, the graphs for FA component also suggest that anatomically adjacent parts are connected and that those that not anatomically adjacent are conditionally independent. When drawn on the jaw, the highest correlations reveal a coherent, spatial pattern in both symmetric and FA components (Fig. 7a, b) , much like that seen in the partial correlations (above): Regions nearest each other tend to be strongly associated whereas more distant regions usually are not. The two consistent and notable exceptions are (1) the correlation between relatively distant anterior incisor alveolus and ramus and (2) the independence between neighboring parts of the angular process. In the case of individual variation (Fig. 7a) , the neighboring ramus and proximal condyloid are not correlated, but the ramus and distal condyloid are, as are the anterior incisor alveolus and proximal coronoid. Those last two correlations are absent from FA. In the case of FA (Fig. 7b) , the neighboring ramus and molar alveolus are not correlated, but the molar alveolus is correlated with the distal part of the condyloid process, a correlation absent from the symmetric component. Despite differences involving several parts, the two components are significantly similar (R M = 0.554; P \\ 0.001).",

In the symmetric variation in deer mice, none of the dental alveoli are integrated with each other at r [ 0.24, nor are they correlated with the ramus, in contrast to the pattern seen in the symmetric variation in fox squirrels. The angular process in deer mice is an integrated unit, and one connected to the ramus, not two independent parts as in fox squirrels. In the FA component of variation in deer mice, the molar alveolus is connected to more parts, and the incisor alveolus to fewer, than in squirrels.

Additionally, the model includes correlations between the anterior incisor alveolus and either proximal coronoid (Fig. 8a) or ramus (Fig. 8b) . The model contains only observed variables, which are hypothesized to have direct (causal) effects on each other. These are indicated by the single-headed arrows, but the data cannot distinguish between causal theories that differ solely in the direction of these arrows because these fit equally well. Both models fit both components of both species well; in no case would we reject the null hypothesis that the deviations between the model and data are no greater than expected by chance (Table 6) . RMSEA values are within the range expected under the hypothesis of perfect fit, and the models improve highly significantly on the null model of no integration.

                "text": "We find a simple, spatially coherent pattern of mandibular integration; in general, adjacent parts are integrated with each other, and more distant parts are not. One paradoxical result of this simple pattern is the apparent complexity revealed by our clustering analysis. Because one part can be adjacent to two others that are not adjacent to each other, one part can be correlated with two others that are not correlated with each other. Rather than finding semiautonomous units of correlated traits, we instead find parts that are connected along a continuous path. But there are exceptions to that simple pattern of adjacency, including independence between some adjacent parts (the two parts of the angular in fox squirrels or the two parts of the incisor alveolus in deer mice) and the dependence of some distant parts (such as anterior incisor alveolus and proximal coronoid mentioned in fox squirrels, and the molar alveolus and angular in the FA component of deer mice). These exceptions differ between the species, but an interesting feature of these exceptions is that they typically involve correlations between the dental alveoli and ramus or coronoid. These interspecific differences are evident in the FA as well as symmetric components, and the species are no more similar in the structure of FA, suggesting that the structure of direct interactions is not especially conservative in rodents. Taken together, our results conflict with the available developmental models for mandibular modularity (e.g., Atchley and Hall 1991; Cheverud et al. 1991; Klingenberg et al. 2003; Badyaev and Foresman 2004; Badyaev et al. 2005) and with the general idea that the mandible is modular (e.g., Cheverud 1996b; Mezey et al. 2000) as well as with the hypothesis that direct interactions are particularly conservative (Klingenberg 2004 (Klingenberg , 2005 ).",

That coupling has been viewed as a feasible explanation for the correlations between shapes of ramal and molar alveolus components and between incisor alveolus and coronoid components found in the tropical forest dwelling hystricomorph rodent Trinomys gratiosus (Monteiro et al. 2005) , as well as for the correlation between shapes of the molar alveolus and ramus/superficial masseter partitions in grassland deer mice (Zelditch et al. 2008) and between incisor alveolus and coronoid/ramus in tree squirrels (this study).",

It is possible that all those correlations depend heavily on the magnitudes and directions of strain vectors generated by gnawing relative to chewing. The same muscle can be variously positioned to serve primarily one or the other of these functions, depending on the material properties of food; for example, in squirrels that feed extensively on hard nuts, the anterior deep masseter is positioned to increase the strength of the power stroke of the incisor bite whereas in other squirrels the position of the anterior deep masseter suggests it plays a more significant role in molar chewing (Thorington and Darrow 1996) . The material properties of food may thus predict both the geometry of muscle arrangements and skeletal form and patterns of integration seen in FA even though those properties are invariant across the two sides of the jaw. Should the strains engendered by jaw function be the signals transmitted via direct interactions, the correlation structure of FA should evolve as function does, being no more conservative than the spatial distribution of strain (Zelditch et al. 2008 ). Because of the diversity of their diets and the resultant diversity of food material properties, squirrels are an ideal model system for testing these hypotheses.",

                "text": "One severe limitation of the present analysis is that we do not know the spatial structure of function-induced bone strain; this has not been studied in rodents and we therefore lack a realistic physical model for it. In the absence of a realistic model for the cause of integration, we cannot devise a predictive statistical model based on that physical model much less predict how variation in bone strain is associated from region to region. This limitation could be overcome by combining finite-element analysis with a formal analysis of morphological integration (Strait et al. 2007) . Still another limitation is that we tested only two models derived from the exploratory analyses, both based on the same general theory, when models that are theoretically incompatible with ours could fit equally well. A novel statistical framework for studies of modularity may overcome this problem in that it evaluates the relative fit of numerous models (e.g., 620 models for the mandible) and finds not only the best model(s) but also the consensus Table 6 Measures of goodness-of-fit for the two statistical models (shown in Fig. 8a, b) to the correlation matrices of symmetric and FA components of fox squirrels and deer mice The Dv 2 gives the difference in fit between fit of the null model of no integration and the substantive models of mandibular integration. Dv 2 asymptotically approaches v 2 , with degrees of freedom equal to the difference in degrees of freedom (Dd.f.) for the two models. RMSEA = Root Mean Square of the Error Approximation across multiple data sets (Marquez In press) . Another limitation of the present study is that we analyzed only correlations among shapes when the sizes of partitions might be more germane to some developmental hypotheses, a limitation that can be overcome by analyzing correlations between partition sizes. Our model of the mandible, as a continuously integrated structure that predictably deviates from this continuity due to the balance between masticatory and gnawing forces, contrasts sharply with the conventional model of cranial integration, which posits a hierarchical arrangement of localized functional/developmental modules. Such a contrast is not surprising because the mandible functions as a lever whereas the cranium serves to support and protect vulnerable local functional units. Thus, we would expect mandibular functional integration to be beam-like in organization, whereas the cranium would be organized as modules within modules. Our analysis also suggests that mandibles differ from crania in the relationship between developmental and functional integration even though the same general principal of bone adaptation plays a central role in both. In the case of the cranium, the match between functional and developmental integration arises, at least in part, from localized, growth-induced integration between functionally coupled parts, building functional integration into the developmental system. In the case of the mandible, the match between functional and developmental integration arises, at least in part, from function-induced growth, building developmental integration into the functional system and enabling direct interactions to evolve when function does.",
