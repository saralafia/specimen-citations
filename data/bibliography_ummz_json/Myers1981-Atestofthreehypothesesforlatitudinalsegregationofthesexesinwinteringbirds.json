Using sex, age, date, and location data from specimens collected south of the breeding range in the western hemisphere, I tested predictions of these hypotheses for two scolopacid shorebirds showing reverse sexual size dimorphism, the red phalarope, Phalaropus fulicarius, and the sanderling, Calidris alba. Neither red phalaropes nor adult sanderlings showed any sexual difference in wintering latitude. First-winter male sanderlings tended to winter farther south than first-winter females. Combined with comparative data from other species of shorebirds and passerines, these results are consistent only with hypothesis 2.",

These hypotheses are not mutually exclusive. In fact, Ketterson and Nolan (1979) propose that the pronounced geographic variation in winter sex ratio of dark-eyed juncos, Junco hyemalis, results from a complex interaction among all three proposed mechanisms.",

Because winter residency is the critical period for testing the hypotheses outlined above (see Ketterson and Nolan 1979) , I eliminated specimens taken during migration. On the basis of data from a color-banded wintering sanderling population in central coastal California (Myers 1980) , this period extends in sanderlings from October to March for adults and November to March for first-winter birds. Comparable data are not available for red phalaropes so I assumed that their schedule was similar. Out of the total set of specimen records examined, this culling left 402 sanderlings and 180 red phalaropes for analysis (Table 1) . Birds of both known and unknown ages were considered.",

For neither species is there any reason to suspect a sex-related collection bias during the winter that would vary systematically among regions. Both are plumage monomorphic in winter. Even if an overall sex bias in collecting occurred, without regional variation in the bias the data should reveal changes in the relative abundance of the two sexes reliably. I assume that any errors in sexing specimens also lack regional trends. I ran separate analyses on adults, on first-winter birds, and on both age classes combined.

One site lay adjacent to the Arctic Ocean at Barrow (71'18' N, 156\"42' W) and the other was approximately l00km to the south and inland at Atkasook (70'27' N, 157\"19' W). Data were gathered at Barrow from 1976 to 1980 and at Atkasook from 1977 to 1979. For details of the censusing technique and descriptions of the areas see Comors et al. (1979) and Myers and Pitelka (1980) . Briefly, in each census a single observer walked a systematic zigzag path along each of 10 (Barrow) or 14 (Atkasook) 1000-m X 100-m transects marked permanently by a single row of stakes down the long axis at 50-m intervals. The path brought the observer to within 25 m of all locations on the transect. Passage from one stake to the next was timed to 3-4 min so that each transect took 1-1.5 h. The low stature of tundra vegetation and tameness of birds allowed detection of virtually all nonincubating phalaropes. As the subject for this analysis, migratory arrival, precedes nesting, incubating birds do not affect the data presented here.",

Although there is some variation in the relative abundance of males versus females, no consistent pattern emerges on sexual differences in arrival schedule. For example, at Barrow males were more abundant along the census transects for the first two sampling periods after arrival began for 2 of the 5 years sampled, whereas females were more numerous the other three. The striking fact, however, is how parallel the changes in their abundance are. My observations of red phalaropes in both study areas but away from the sampled transects are consistent with these data. Typically the first sighting of red phalaropes during a particular year involve birds of both sexes together in pairs or small flocks flying over the tundra.",

At issue is whether any of the three hypotheses outlined in the Introduction predict both the specific results for sanderlings and red phalaropes as well as the overall pattern of Table 4 .

GI] one hand, while statistically significant, the difference is small (Fig. 2) compared with differences observed in other species, especially the dark-eyed junco (Ketterson and Nolan 1976) and the ruff, Philomachus pugnax (Greenhalgh 1968 ). Moreover, because the adult sanderling distributions so clearly contradict hypotheses 1 and 3, I favor an alternative, even if post-hoc, interpretation for the differences within first-winter birds. If sanderling males show delayed maturity, then by hypothesis 2 first-winter males should winter farther south. This follows because without breeding, there would be no reason for a first-winter male to migrate north in the breeding season, and certainly not to appear among the first arrivals, so it could winter farther south than first-winter females (see below concerning ideal winter distribution). Individuals of many shorebird species, including sanderlings, remain south of their breeding grounds during the nesting season. Unfortunately, in only a few are data sufficient to test for delayed maturity (Eliot et al. 1976; Myers 1981) , and the sanderling is not among them. I predict that sanderling males show delayed maturity compared with females and do not mate in their first summer after hatching.",

Further, and more importantly, his observations began on 16 June even though he estimated egg laying began as early as 10 June. Thus Ridley did not witness arrival.

They are what is available now. The weakest link is the degree to which the geography of collecting has emphasized north temperate distributions (Figs. 1, 2) . To an unknown degree the shape of those distributions reflects collector activities rather than bird distribution. If nothing else, this emphasizes the continuing need for building museum series even of common species. But fortunately, the analysis does not depend upon a distribution of samples proportional to the underlying geographic distribution of the species; it is based instead on relative comparisons between the sexes. Thus despite limitations in these data, the analysis should have revealed winter sexual segregation were the patterns as conspicuous as those reported for other species.",

Sexually staggered arrival might occur for two reasons. First, the sexes might differ simply in the phenology of resource use. Second, there may be sexual differences in the degree of intrasexual competition for breeding sites, related to the clear importance of priority in obtaining better breeding territories (HildCn 1979) . The most likely interpretation combines these two arguments: In species with territorial defense, the sex establishing territories should arrive as early as possible; how early relative to breeding is set by the availability of food. The other sex, in contrast, will delay until the onset of nesting, modified by the degree to which it also experiences intrasexual competition for breeding sites. This interpretation makes two predictions: (i) nontemtorial species (e.g. phalaropes) should not show staggered arrival schedules; and (ii) for species with similar, territorial breeding social systems, staggering should decrease with increasing latitude because of increased breeding season compression. Sanderlings' lack of staggering may thus result from their high arctic breeding distribution (also see below).",

This implies some sort of ideal winter distribution for each sex.

Both red phalaropes and sanderlings stand out among the species in Table 4 as showing facultative sequential polyandry. Red phalaropes, moreover, are nontemtorial, and sanderlings, although territorial, breed at very low density compared with other sandpipers (Schamel and Tracey 1977; HildCn 1979) . These factors may lessen the importance of early arrival to males. Several other migratory shorebirds share one or the other of these characteristics and thus offer tests for this interpretation compared with the predictions related to resource phenologies outlined above. These species include mountain plover, Eupoda montana (Graul 1973) , dotterel, Eudromias morinella (Nethersole-Thompson 1973), Temminck's stint, Calidris temminckii (HildCn 1975) , northern phalarope, Phalaropus lobatus (HildCn and Vuolanto 1972) , and Wilson's phalarope, P . tricolor (Kagarise 1979 ). Temminck's stints are particularly interesting because (i) their mating system is comparable with sanderling's, (ii) males are smaller and arrive earlier than females ( 0 . HildCn, personal communication), and (iii) early males obtain better territories than do late males (Hildkn 1979) . This species should be compared for latitudinal segregation in winter with the spotted sandpiper, a simultaneously polyandrous species (Oring and Knudsen 1972) with females larger than males, female territorial defense, and females arriving before males (L. W. Oring, personal communication) . I predict that male Tem-minck's stints and female spotted sandpipers winter farther north.",
