    "abstract": "ABSTRAGr.-Variation in litter size was examined in meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus) during a 14-month period in 1979-1980 near Ann Arbor, Michigan. Mean litter size declined sharply each autumn, at the end of the breeding season. This pattern of autumnal decline in litter size is widespread in the genus Microtus. We examined four hypotheses that might might explain the seasonal decline in litter size: the decline reflects possibly adaptive changes in the birth mass of offspring; the decline reflects differential investment in offspring of one sex; the decline reflects a decrease in the mass of mothers; and the decline reflects a change in the average age or parity of mothers. To evaluate these hypotheses, we examined changes in litter size, masses of young and mothers, the sex ratio of litters, and associations among these reproductive variables by bringing live-caught pregnant females into the laboratory and observing their litters. Mean neonatal mass, total mass of litters, and mother's mass varied significantly during the breeding season, but preliminary estimates of age and parity of mothers did not. The number of young in a litter was correlated strongly and positively with the postpartum mass of the mother and correlated weakly and negatively with the mass of neonates. No single hypothesis adequately accounted for seasonal changes in litter size. At best, the first and third hypotheses together could account for about half of the seasonal variation in litter size.",

The general pattern is that mean litter size declines from summer to autumn, remains low if winter breeding occurs, then increases in spring. The major exception to the pattern of decline from spring or summer to autumn occurs in some populations of M. californicus that cease to breed during late spring or early summer (Krohne, 1980 (Krohne, , 1981 . Litter size declines as the dry season approaches in most populations of M. californicus and as the cold season approaches in other vole species.",

If a similar pattern is found in voles, then the seasonal pattern in litter size might reflect changes in a mother's investment in individual young. That is, reduced litter size might be a consequence of mothers producing larger young. This can be tested by comparing litter sizes \"adjusted\" to constant mass of young by covariance analysis. If significant differences in litter size remain among seasons after the average mass of young is made equal by means of regression analysis, then seasonal variation in mass cannot adequately explain seasonal variation in litter size. This hypothesis also requires that the total mass of young born should not decline seasonally, because decreases in litter size would be compensated by increases in the masses of individual young. The finding that changes in litter size are \"explained\" (in a statistical sense), however, by changes in neonatal mass would not provide strong support for the hypothesis, because either litter size or neonatal mass could be the causal variable.",

This was accomplished through the removal of large numbers of female voles from several populations. The populations were manipulated by these removals, and further sampling of the same fields might reflect the influence of this manipulation rather than natural changes in reproduction. This problem has been ignored by several previous investigators of seasonal change in litter size (Anderson and Boonstra, 1979; Keller and Krebs, 1970; Tamarin, 1977) . Rather than sample populations repeatedly, we chose to sample several different local populations in the general area of Ann Arbor, Michigan. This procedure, however, may be misleading if local differences exist among fields (Cockburn and Lidicker, 1983; Myers and Master, 1986) . Such differences existed in only one of the 30-day periods, and this difference accounted for less than a third of the variation in litter size during that period. Similarly, Krohne (1980 Krohne ( , 1981 grouped populations of California voles within a 15-km range for analysis of reproduction.",

Myers and Master (1983) found that larger mothers had larger litters within populations of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus; mother's mass was measured at conception, but the same pattern was evident for mother's postpartum mass). If this hypothesis accounts for seasonal variation in litter size, then \"adjusting\" mean litter size to constant mother's mass by covariance analysis should eliminate seasonal variation in litter size. Postpartum mass of mothers was associated strongly with litter size (Table 2) and declined in autumn, as did litter size (Figs. 1a and 2c) . Regression revealed that a substantial amount of the total variation (seasonal and nonseasonal) in litter size (39%) could be explained by mother's mass. When the influence of mother's mass was removed from litter size, however, adjusted litter size was still significantly heterogeneous among the eight study periods (Fig. 1c) , so that much variation remained to be explained by other factors. Also, analysis of residuals revealed that a minor amount of seasonal variation in litter size was explained by changes in mother's mass. If mothers with large litters lost weight during pregnancy relative to mothers with small litters, then correlation between mother's mass and litter size would be lower at birth than at conception. Thus, the correlation of litter size and postpartum mass of mothers (Table 2 ) might be considered a minimum estimate of the association of the mother's mass and litter size.",

In the deer-mouse study, increases in litter size with age and parity could be explained as a result of increasing mother's mass, especially for younger females. Severalobservations suggested that seasonal changes in the average age or parity of females in populations we studied could not explain the seasonal decline in litter size. Litters born both to younger (=smaller) and older (=larger) females showed a similar pattern of autumnal decline in litter size. The proportion of mothers falling into the younger age class did not change from season to season. The proportion of lactating (therefore not primiparous) females did not differ between autumn and other seasons. Although average litter size of females estimated to be primiparous was small and may not have varied seasonally, the fraction of primiparous females in the Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jmammal/article/70/1/142/901966 by University of Michigan user on 07 October 2021 population did not vary significantly among the study periods. Finally, the mean litter size of primiparous mothers was slightly (though not significantly) higher than mean autumn litter sizes of multiparous mothers. For the autumn decline in litter size to have resulted from a change in average parity of mothers, nearly all females in the autumn populations would have to have been primiparous. This was not the case; 45% of the 33 mothers caught during autumn periods were lactating, and therefore, known to be multiparous. Our tests of influences of age and parity have several weaknesses. Age and parity could not be measured directly in our study; we relied on litters born to wild-trapped females. Age and parity were inferred from evidence including mass, so effects of age, mass, and parity on litter size could not be separated unambiguously. Further, in some species of arvicolines, growth rates vary among seasons or with population conditions (Ford, 1981; Taitt and Krebs, 1985) , so that using specific masses to estimate age possibly resulted in systematic biases. If, for example, growth is slowed during winter, then \"age\" classes based on a 33-g-cutoff value contain older individuals in spring than in autumn. Nevertheless, we found no support for predictions based on seasonal shifts in average age or parity in determining litter size, and we tentatively reject this hypothesis.",

Competition for food resources may be an important factor in life histories of voles (Ostfeld, 1985) . Cole and Batzli (1978) reduced competition for food resources by providing high-quality food pellets to a population of M. ochrogaster, and found that litter size increased significantly relative to a control population.
