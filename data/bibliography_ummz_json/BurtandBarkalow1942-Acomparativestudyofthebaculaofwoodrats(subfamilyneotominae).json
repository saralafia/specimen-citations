Recently, Wade and Gilbert (1940) published on the bacula of some of the Sciuridae. Here, too, significant differences and similarities were found and were considered by the authors to be of importance in determining relationships within the family of squirrels. Bacula of wood rats have accumulated in our collections until we now have represented 26 subspecies of eleven species and the four subgenera, Neotoma, Hodomys, Teonoma, and Teanopus. All of the species groups recognized by Goldman (1910) for the genus Neotoma are represented, but a number of Mexican species are still lacking.",

We are especially indebted to Seth B. Benson for a specimen each of Teanopus and N. juscipes, to Walter W. Dalquest and Harold E. Broadbooks for N. cinerea, Claude W. Hibbard for N. fioridana, and Earl L. Poole for specimens of N. magister. The U. S. Biological Survey kindly loaned a specimen of magister. The drawings were made from photographs by Grace Eager. The history of the baculum is not known, fossil elements being rare in collections. The widespread occurrence of the baculum in diverse groups of mammals suggests, however, that it is not a late acquisition. Our arrangement is not intended to represent a phylogenetic series, but rather a series showing progressive degrees of simplification of the bone which in turn might be interpreted as being farthest from the ancestral type. We realize the fallibility of attempting to construct a true phylogeny on recent material alone. In our arrangement of the wood rats we have considered, in addition to the character of the baculum, other morphological characters as well as the present geographic distribution of the various species. A number of Mexican wood rats, some of which undoubtedly will prove to be races of more widely distributed species, are omitted here because of lack of material. These can be intercalated in their proper places as material becomes available. Wherever our arrangement differs from that given by Goldman (1910) we have thought it necessary to reconsider those characters used by Merriam (1894) and by Goldman (ibid.) and evaluate them in the light of our present knowledge.",

In curved bacula, as those of the species lepida, the length measurement does not represent the actual length of the bone; rather, it is a measurement of a chord with the distal and proximal ends of the baculum as the points of intersection with the arc formed by the bone. The basal measurements are the greatest diameters, dorso-ventral and lateral, of this part of the baculum. Measurements of the shaft were taken near the midpoint of that part of the bone. The diameters of the shaft must be considered as approximations. With a gradually tapering bone, a slight shift of the calipers toward one or the other end will give a different reading. These measurements indicate whether the shaft is circular or compressed, laterally or dorso-ventrally, in cross-section. They also give a rough picture of the relative thickness of the shaft in the different species. Only adult specimens were measured. Measurements are given in Table I .",

Further, the bone differs so markedly from the bones of other groups as to suggest sub generic distinction. The long, ventrally-curved baculum, has a slightly expanded proximal end, usually dumbbell shaped in cross section. The bone tapers from the proximal end, first rather abruptly then gradually, to the tip of the long shaft ( fig. lA) . At the middle of the shaft the bone is oval in cross section, the lateral diameter being slightly greater than the dorso-ventral. Neotoma bunkeri, which was allocated to the \"fuscipes group\" on the basis of skull characters (Burt, 1932) is in fact a member of the lepida group as shown by the character of the baculum. Neotoma lepida insularis is placed in this group provisionally. We have but one baculum of this island rat and although it has an abnormal appearance, it seems best to allocate it to this group. On skull characters and on geographic grounds it fits best here.",

In the extremely short shaft, however, it differs from lepida and resembles the other groups. The shaft is nearly circular in cross-section and slightly constricted in the middle. The skull of Juscipes, so far as now known, differs fundamentally from those of other species of the subgenus N eotoma only in its larger upper third molar with the middle enamel loop partially or completely divided by deepening of the inner reentrant angle. This character is found in bunkeri, the baculum of which conforms with those of the lepida group.

In the subgenus Neotoma proper, the third lower molars vary in enamel pattern from those with the reentrant angles cutting only part way across the tooth, leaving a dentine connection between front and back lobes, to those with a complete separation of front and back lobes, each surrounded by enamel. Because of this variability in the pattern of the third lower molar in N eotoma, the close approach in certain specimens to H odomys, and because we find no additional pertinent characters, we believe it best to reduce H odomys to subgeneric rank.
