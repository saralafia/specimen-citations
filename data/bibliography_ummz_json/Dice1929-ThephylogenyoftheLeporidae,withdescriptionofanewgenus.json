This discontinuous present distribution of the subfamily is corroborative evidence of its antiquity. It is with some hesitation that I establish a subfamily on characters seemingly intermediate between those of the other two subfamilies of the Leporidae. However, no forms are known which clearly connect Archaeolagus and Hupolaqus to either the Palaeolaginae or Leporinae. Also, Hupolaqus seems to have persisted in North America long after the Leporinae had become established in the Old World. It therefore seems probable that Archaeolagus and Hypolagus represent an independent line of evolution which persisted over a fairly long period of geologic time in North America, but disappeared in the Pleistocene. Brachylagus with one species has a restricted, distribution in the Great Basin region of western North America.",
