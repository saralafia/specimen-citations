                "text": "ABSTRACT As climate conditions continue to shift, species assemblages and composition within ecological communities may be reshuffled in unpredictable ways. Some habitat types may cease to exist while others may expand in size; protecting ecosystems and species in their current locations will become increasingly difficult. Threatened and endangered species are likely to be disproportionately affected by climate change because they are often habitat specialists and relatively rare. In the United States, the 1973 Endangered Species Act has prevented the extinction of many species. The identification and conservation of critical habitat is an important tool for species preservation. But how do we designate and preserve habitat for protected species when we are unsure about future habitat conditions? We address this question based upon the concept of managing for anticipated change, rather than focusing on the maintenance of existing conditions. We used an ecological niche modeling program (MaxEnt) to model current and future climatic niche for an endangered mammal endemic to southern California, USA; the Stephens' kangaroo rat (SKR, Dipodomys stephensi). Our results indicate that the climatic niche of SKR was governed primarily by precipitation during the dry season, precipitation seasonality, annual mean temperature, and mean summer temperature. Projecting current species-presence relationships to different scenarios predicted for the future revealed substantial loss in climatic niche with increased emission rates. Areas of future suitable climatic niche were evaluated in relation to land ownership and identified as potential reserves or translocation sites, which can aid in conservation planning for this species. Additionally, species vulnerability assessments and a climate-change analysis tool were utilized to demonstrate how overall understanding of climate change effects can be enhanced. Information presented here can serve as guiding principles for the inclusion of climate change considerations into management plans, and can better inform overall decision-making related to endangered species management. \u00d3 2019 The Wildlife Society.",

Many plant and animal species are responding to altered temperature and precipitation regimes by shifting their geographical ranges (Parmesan and Yohe 2003 , Parmesan 2006 , Chen et al. 2011 . This may lead to alterations in ecological community composition where habitat for some species may increase in size; but, for others, available habitat area may decrease or cease to exist altogether (Hobbs et al. 2009) . Average global temperature is predicted to increase 2-38C by the end of this century, and as a result 20-30% of the world's species may be faced with extinction (IPCC 2014b). Furthermore, the resiliency of current ecosystems may be exceeded by a combination of disturbances associated with climate change (such as flooding, drought, insect outbreaks) and ongoing anthropogenic activities (such as pollution, habitat fragmentation, urbanization; Holling 1973) . Preserving ecosystems and species in their current locations may become increasingly difficult because climate change is emerging as the greatest conservation challenge of the future.",

For example, the endangered Uncompahgre fritillary butterfly (Boloria improba acrocnema) has been found only in willow (Salix spp.) forests located on northeast-facing slopes above 3,780 m in Colorado, USA. The 11 known populations inhabit areas that provide the coolest and wettest microclimates available; climate change appears to be the largest threat to the long-term survival of the species (Britten et al. 1994) . Similarly, a small number of endangered mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei) survive in the wild, and populations currently occur only within 2 protected areas of Africa, where individuals face ongoing threats from anthropogenic deforestation, disease transmission, and poaching. These threats may be exacerbated by future climate change, raising questions about the park's long-term suitability for gorillas (Thorne et al. 2013) . These examples illustrate how threatened and endangered species may be affected both directly (e.g., altered temperature or precipitation regimes) and indirectly (e.g., altered competition or predation levels) by environmental changes resulting from climate change.",

Although there is ongoing debate related to the effectiveness of the legislation, the ESA is one of the strongest environmental laws in the United States and it has been successful at preventing the extinction of the majority of the species it protects (Scott et al. 2005 , Evans et al. 2016 . Federal landmanagement agencies frequently work to avoid, minimize, and mitigate effects on listed species and their habitats, particularly in the western half of the United States that contains a large proportion of public lands. Additionally, federal land managers have been directed to manage for change and focus on sustaining ecological function, rather than preserving historical assemblages of plants and animals within ecosystems. In response, guidelines have been developed for managers and others to incorporate climate change considerations into natural resource management actions (e.g., Stein et al. 2014) . Although much of this guidance applies to threatened and endangered species, management and recovery plans have traditionally relied upon the identification and preservation of species habitat (Table 1; Noss et al. 1997) . This ongoing paradigm shift presents challenges particularly for listed species with a narrow range and relatively small distribution, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat (Dipodomys stephensi).",

It is typically found in grassland habitats with minimal shrub cover, characterized by well-drained, friable soils. Similar to other heteromyid rodents, SKR is well-adapted to arid environments and feed mainly on seeds (Bleich 1977) . Stephens' kangaroo rats select relatively open habitat that has been maintained traditionally by disturbance events such as fire or grazing (Thomas 1975, O'Farrell and Uptain 1987) . Once or twice a year, females give birth to 2-3 offspring (Lackey 1967) ; survival to adulthood is estimated to be 18% (Price and Kelley 1994) . Population size and distribution appear to fluctuate widely over time, and SKR has been classified as following a meta-population dynamic, where spatial and temporal extent of occurrence is perpetually shifting (Price and Gilpin 1996) . The species was listed as endangered in 1988, primarily as a result of their small geographic range (<5,000 km 2 ), ongoing decline in extent of occurrence, and continued habitat loss (Linzey and NatureServe 2008) .",

Specific guidance related to climate change effects, such as the identification of future habitats, aids in overall conservation planning efforts for managers with limited time and resources. We used an ecological-niche modeling program, MaxEnt, to examine present climatic niche of SKR and climate change effects on potential future distribution of SKR. MaxEnt relies upon presence-only records, and is one of the most widely utilized programs for climatic niche modeling because of its user-friendly software and high predictive accuracy (Elith et al. 2006 , Merow et al. 2013 . Biologically relevant information is incorporated into the decision-making process for data input and selection of settings, leading to stronger inference for the target species. We supplemented MaxEnt modeling results with information obtained from several easily accessed, free online tools, including Climate Wizard, the System for Assessing Vulnerability of Species (SAVS) program, and NatureServe's Climate Change Vulnerability Index (CCVI).

The species inhabited isolated habitat patches that occurred across a relatively small area ($2,879 km 2 ), ranging from 55 m to 1,250 m above sea level (Bleich 1977) . The southern California region was topographically complex and contained a variety of ecosystems and microclimates. This resulted in high levels of biodiversity, with the California floristic province designated as a global biodiversity hotspot (Myers et al. 2000) . Precipitation varied greatly by elevation and human settlements were largely dependent on water resources originating in mountainous areas. Southern California was one of the fastest growing regions in the United States, and habitats selected by SKR (e.g., annual grassland or coastal sage scrub) were also very appealing for agricultural and urban developers. Stephens' kangaroo rats typically occurred in rolling grasslands on loamy soils, interspersed with areas of coastal sage scrub or mixed chaparral. Common vegetation included grasses such as purple or nodding needle grass (Nassella pulchra, N. cernua) and common wild oat (Avena fatua), coastal sage scrub species such as California sagebrush (Artemisia californica) and California buckwheat (Eriogonum fasciculatum), and mixed chaparral plants such as scrub oak (Quercus berberidifolia) and manzanita (Arctostaphylos spp.).",

                "text": "We used predictor variables to model the future climatic niche of SKR under 4 different trajectories of greenhouse gas concentration, or Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). The RCPs reflected potential emission levels of greenhouse gases projected over the next few decades, and ranged from optimistic scenarios of emission reductions after 2020 (RCP 2.6) to assumptions that emissions will continue to increase until 2100 (RCP 8.5; Weyant 2009) . We used future climatic projections for the year 2050 under 4 RCPs (2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5), in conjunction with a general circulation model (GCM) known for its accurate climate projections for California (CCSM; Stralberg et al. 2009) . The NDVI was assumed to be constant across these projections because climate change was not likely to substantially alter overall vegetation cover in this area (Kelly and Goulden 2008) . We utilized a Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) approach to model the current and future climatic niche of SKR. We modeled the present climatic niche using current locations along with climatic predictor variables and NDVI, including the linear, quadratic, hinge, and product functions of MaxEnt. We cross-validated the model by using a 20% test sample (n \u00bc 12) drawn randomly from the presence locations. To assess model precision, we conducted 100 bootstrap resampling runs, and compared and validated results using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) statistics. We employed a jackknife simulation to assess the relative contribution of each variable, and removed variables that did not contribute to model predictions. This model established a relationship between SKR occurrence and predictor variables, and estimated the present climatic niche for SKR in southern California. We then projected this relationship to the future (2050) under the 4 RCP climate scenarios. Based upon previous studies, all pixels above the 10th percentile training presence in the output raster were considered as potential niche areas (Elith et al. 2011) . We compared the area estimated by this threshold for each future scenario with the present area to assess the maximum percentage decline. We selected a conservative projection area of 10 km to the north and south of the current distribution of SKR, which is 300 times the known distance dispersed by the species (Price and Kelly 1994) . Climatic projection beyond this area is not recommended because it may be statistically flawed (Rodda et al. 2011 , Merow et al. 2013 , while also ecologically invalid because the species could be influenced by novel biotic factors not previously encountered (Araujo and Guisan 2006) . We obtained land ownership data from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (http://frap. fire.ca.gov/data/frapgisdata-sw-ownership13_2_download, accessed 27 Sep 2017) and overlaid these data on the niche model to examine the climatic niche suitability in relation to land ownership status. These data represented California public land ownership as of 1 July 2013.",

First, we conducted a vulnerability assessment using the System for Assessing Vulnerability of Species (SAVS, http:// www.fs.fed.us/rm/grassland-shrubland-desert/products/ species-vulnerability/; accessed 19 Nov 2016) program developed by the Rocky Mountain Research Station (Bagne et al. 2011) . This tool incorporated life-history traits and other ecological factors into a scoring system to predict vulnerability, resilience, or no change. Results included an overall vulnerability score (ranging from \u00c020 to 20) plus a score for several categories (ranging from \u00c05 to 5) including habitat, physiology, phenology, and biotic interactions. In all categories, a positive score indicated a species was more vulnerable to climate change, while a negative score indicated more resiliency. Table 2 . The source and rationale of climatic and environmental predictor variables selected a priori for use in ecological niche models (MaxEnt) for Stephens' kangaroo rat in southern California, USA. Climatic variables were sourced from the Worldclim bioclimatic data set, which were derived from weather station measurements of temperature and precipitation. Vegetation cover variables were obtained from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS). The spatial resolution of all predictors was 1 km 2 . Daly et al. 1990; 2, Goldingay and Price 1997; 3, Moses et al. 2012; 4, Price and Kelley 1994; 5, Bleich 1977; 6, O'Farrell 1990; 7, Price et al. 1995; 8, Kelt et al. 2005 . Table 3 . Correlation matrix of climatic predictors relevant for niche modeling of Stephens' kangaroo rat in southern California, USA. Red highlighted values were correlated significantly and positively (r > 0.6), while green highlighted values were correlated significantly and negatively (r < \u00c00.6). A combination of b1, b5, b14, and NDVI was used because these were not correlated and ecologically relevant. Second, we used NatureServe's Climate Change Vulnerability Index (http://www.natureserve.org/conservationtools/climate-change-vulnerability-index; accessed 19 Nov 2016) to further investigate the susceptibility of SKR to effects of climate change (CCVI; Young et al. 2016) . This index utilized climate projections, along with data related to current distribution, natural history, and ecological associations of SKR, to predict if there would be range contraction or population extirpations. We assessed sensitivity using factors in 2 main categories: direct and indirect exposure to climate change, and species-specific adaptive capacity. Climate exposure was determined by examining projected temperature and moisture change within the assessment area. Results were grouped into 1 of 5 established categories: extremely vulnerable, highly vulnerable, moderately vulnerable, less vulnerable, and insufficient evidence (Young et al. 2016) .",

Our results indicated comparatively less influence of NDVI (9% [AE7%]) on determining the climatic niche of SKR. Reliability of our results was verified by an AUC mean score of 0.86 AE 0.02 (SD) for the present distribution model. An area the size of 6,061 km 2 was found to be currently climatically suitable for SKR, and the majority of this occurred on privately owned land (Fig. 2) . The amount of climatic niche for SKR was projected to decline with increased greenhouse gas emissions represented by all RCPs. The climatic niche area was predicted to shrink to 3,993 km 2 under RCP 2.6, 3,274 km 2 under RCP 4.5, 5,888 km 2 under RCP 6.0, and 2,040 km 2 under RCP 8.5. The geographic location of climatically suitable areas shifted under different climate scenarios, with a larger percentage of areas occurring on publicly owned lands projected for the future (Fig. 3) . Some eastern areas in southern California were projected to convert from nonhabitat to available habitat under future scenarios (Fig. S1 , available online in Supporting Information). However, this area is novel for most of the predictors (Fig. S2 , available online in Supporting Information), meaning that it is influenced by environmental variables outside the range present in the training data and should be considered cautiously (Elith et al. 2010) . Thus, the species may be faced with a reduction in distribution and shift in the size and extent of area of available habitat in the future.",

                "text": "Modeling results identified precipitation of the driest month (Bio14) as a significant predictor of climatic niche, which may represent a minimum threshold of moisture required by vegetation selected by Stephens' kangaroo rat (SKR). Temperature-related variables that contributed to the climatic niche of SKR, annual mean temperature (Bio1), and maximum temperature of warmest month (Bio5) may represent an upper temperature threshold for both SKR individuals and selected vegetation. Overall vegetation cover as represented by NDVI was not a strong contributor to climatic niche for SKR in MaxEnt models, which may indicate relatively less influence on amount of vegetation cover, and more emphasis on the type of cover. Climate change may not alter NDVI measures in southern California, but community composition could shift away from plant species selected by SKR (Kelly and Goulden 2008) , and specific plant species could be included as predictors in future modeling efforts. SKR will likely be affected by such climate-driven alterations because this species selects forb-dominated grasslands and is not known to occur in large densities in other vegetation communities (Bleich 1977 , O'Farrell 1990 , Price et al. 1995 , Kelt et al. 2005 . Climate change vulnerability of California grasslands has been classified as mid to high, based upon 2 emission scenarios that represented a range of warming between 1.99-4.568C and a 24.8% decrease in precipitation statewide (Thorne et al. 2016) . Other studies in southern California have predicted a 38-44% decrease in coastal sage scrub communities, and a 16-48% loss of grassland habitats by the end of the 21st century (Lenihan et al. 2008 , Thorne et al. 2016 . Furthermore, SKR is dependent on natural fire regimes for maintenance of habitat, and effects from alterations in disturbance patterns are unknown (Price et al. 1995) . Shifts in vegetation community composition and structure could be hastened by changes in fire severity and frequency. For example, studies conducted in San Diego County documented large shifts in vegetation community composition following fires, resulting in part from the prevalence of invasive annual grasses (Zedler et al. 1983) . Additionally, increased drought and aridity could act in conjunction with other factors (e.g., increased insect attacks) to cause permanent shifts in vegetation community composition (Minnich 2007) . Finally, predicted changes in soil erosivity could affect vegetation while also having negative effects on SKR populations because specific requirements related to soil have been identified as an ecological factor limiting species distribution (Bleich 1977 ).",

The thermal sensitivity of SKR is not well-understood, and an increased frequency of extremely high-temperature events may cause direct mortality of individuals. Research related to another kangaroo rat species, the banner-tailed kangaroo rat (D. spectabilis), found that higher daily surface temperatures during the summer negatively affected apparent survival (Moses et al. 2012) . Additionally, higher temperatures may halt or diminish activities essential to population persistence such as foraging, dispersal, and reproduction. Kangaroo rat species have been known to shift reproductive strategies in response to environmental change, and the effect of previously unprecedented temperature increases on SKR reproduction is unknown (Zeng and Brown 1987) . In addition to directly affecting SKR behavior, warmer nights may facilitate increased activity by predators or competitors. Research on other species of kangaroo rats has documented relatively high rates of predation, particularly during the breeding season (Daly et al. 1990) . Habitat loss has been the primary factor driving SKR decline, but accelerating climate change has the potential to introduce new physiological threats that could pose a greater risk.",

Geographic or anthropogenic factors, such as barriers to dispersal or urban development, may restrict actual SKR distribution to smaller areas than those predicted by climatic niche models (Phillips et al. 2006) . Furthermore, the size and location of habitat patches are likely to be influenced by other factors (e.g., fire frequency, urban development), and the exact location and degree of such effects remain difficult to predict. Thus, model results presented here should be perceived as guidelines rather than prescription for future conservation planning efforts.",

                "text": "The climate change vulnerability of a species is not necessarily predicted by its conservation status, and response to climate change varies according to the unique life-history traits, distribution, and habitat requirements of the species. Although results from both vulnerability assessments (SAVS and CCVI) indicate that SKR is not extremely vulnerable to climate change, it is important to remember that these analyses do not account for nonclimatic factors (e.g., habitat loss) that could contribute to species decline. Recognition of this has far-reaching implications for species conservation, especially for federal agencies with a disproportionately large number of listed species such as the Department of Defense (DoD). Although DoD manages a relatively small percentage of public land holdings, federal lands overseen by DoD contain the largest number of threatened and endangered species (Groves et al. 2000) . Out of 729 DoD installations, 224 (31%) contain threatened and endangered species (Stein et al. 2008) . Many military installations are located in undeveloped, biologically diverse areas (e.g., coastal ecosystems) resulting in the creation of habitat refuges for imperiled species. Particularly large numbers of listed species occur on installations in California, Florida, and Hawaii, USA, mimicking global patterns of biodiversity (Stein et al. 2008) . Species vulnerability assessments can be used as a management tool to help prioritize conservation needs, so that actions can be directed in an effective manner while allowing for military training. Anticipation of future effects of climate change can help to ameliorate those effects through early intervention, which is key for cost-effective natural resource conservation. Our results can aid in the identification of management targets for SKR and provide a framework for integrating new research and information about the species.",

The identification and protection of habitat refugia into which future populations could migrate, or use as corridors for dispersal, is another management strategy. Acquisition of conservation lands should focus on terrain that is spatially and topographically complex because these areas have greater potential to harbor climate refugia. Finally, managers may want to consider translocating individuals among areas of occupied habitat or into new habitat, where appropriate. Although translocation is a controversial management strategy with inherent disease and genetic risks, SKR populations have been translocated at Camp Pendleton (USFWS 2015) and locales in Riverside County (O'Farrell et al. 1994) . We do not universally recommend translocation under all circumstances; however, this may be one of the best conservation strategies for SKR because the species appears to be relatively resilient to direct effects of climate change (e.g., warmer temperatures), but may not be able to migrate into more climatically suitable habitats in the heavily urbanized landscape of southern California.
