This wide range may reflect differences in the efficacy of selection due to differences in the effective population size (N e). However, most comparisons have been made among distantly related organisms that differ not only in N e but also in many other aspects of their biology. Here, we estimate a in three closely related lineages of house mice that have a similar ecology but differ widely in N e : Mus musculus musculus (N e ; 25,000-120,000), M. m. domesticus (N e ; 58,000-200,000), and M. m. castaneus (N e ; 200,000-733,000). Mice were genotyped using a high-density single nucleotide polymorphism array, and the proportions of replacement and silent mutations within subspecies were compared with those fixed between each subspecies and an outgroup, Mus spretus. There was significant evidence of positive selection in M. m. castaneus, the lineage with the largest N e , with a estimated to be approximately 40%. In contrast, estimates of a for M. m. domesticus (a 5 13%) and for M. m. musculus (a 5 12 %) were much smaller. Interestingly, the higher estimate of a for M. m. castaneus appears to reflect not only more adaptive fixations but also more effective purifying selection. These results support the hypothesis that differences in N e contribute to differences among species in the efficacy of selection.",

Several methods have been developed to empirically estimate the proportion of amino acid substitutions fixed by positive selection termed a (e.g., Bustamante et al. 2001; Smith and Eyre-Walker 2002;  Eyre-Walker and Keightley 2009) . These methods follow from the neutral expectation that the ratio of synonymous to nonsynonymous mutations should be the same within and between species (McDonald and Kreitman 1991) . Assuming that synonymous variation is not under selection, deviations from this expectation may be used to estimate a (e.g., Smith and Eyre-Walker 2002; Fay et al. 2002) .",

                "text": "The fraction of substitutions fixed by selection is a function of N e s, where N e is the effective population size and s is the selection coefficient (Kimura 1983) . Therefore, differences in estimates of a among taxa may reflect differences in s, differences in N e , or both. N e is expected to influence the contribution of positive selection to amino acid substitution in two ways. First, given an equal rate of mutation, larger populations will have a greater input of new mutations simply due to the greater number of individuals contributing mutations. Second, drift can overwhelm selection in small populations such that mutations with s on the order of 1/N e or smaller will behave as if effectively neutral (e.g., Ohta 1973; Kimura 1983) . Consequently, a is predicted to be larger in larger populations. Indeed, empirical studies provide support for a correlation between N e and rates of adaptive substitution. Taxa with the highest estimates of a tend to have high N e . In Drosophila, estimates of a are consistently above 50% (Smith and Eyre-Walker 2002; Andolfatto 2007; Begun et al. 2007; Maside and Charlesworth 2007; Shapiro et al. 2007; Bachtrog 2008; Eyre-Walker and Keightley 2009 ; for review, see Sella et al. 2009) . Estimates of a in the European Aspen, Populus tremula (N e ; 10 5 ), and the outcrossing crucifer, Capsella grandiflora (N e ; 5 \u00c2 10 5 ), are also large and in the range of 30-40% (Ingvarsson 2010; Slotte et al. 2010) . Among mammals, there is evidence that a is large (up to 57%; Halligan et al. 2010) in the house mouse, Mus musculus castaneus for which N e estimates range from 200,000 to over 700,000 (Geraldes et al. 2008 (Geraldes et al. , 2011 Halligan et al. 2010 ). On the other hand, in Arabidopsis (Foxe et al. 2008) , yeast (Doniger et al. 2008) , and humans (Mikkelsen et al. 2005; Zhang and Li 2005; Boyko et al. 2008) , taxa with low N e , adaptive substitutions appear to represent only a small fraction of amino acid divergence. However, these comparisons are between taxa that differ not only in N e but also in many aspects of their biology. To separate the effects of s and N e , one would ideally like to compare closely related taxa that differ in N e but are otherwise similar. Two recent studies have taken this approach, one comparing two fruit fly species separated by ;2 my (Jensen and Bachtrog 2011) and the other comparing multiple species of sunflowers diverging roughly 8 Ma (Strasburg et al. 2011) . Although the taxa compared are still separated by millions of years, they are more closely related than any previous comparisons and, in both studies, the species with larger N e showed more evidence of adaptive fixations.",

                "text": "The use of a genotyping array rather than DNA sequences of individual genes has both advantages and disadvantages. SNP genotyping has the principal advantage of being a relatively low cost, high throughput method, enabling a survey of coding regions throughout the genome. Therefore, SNP genotyping reduces the biases that might be introduced by sampling a limited set of genes, biases that may be significant for traditional sequencing studies. The chief disadvantage of this approach lies in the potential ascertainment bias of SNPs interrogated by the array. First, although SNPs included are likely to represent variation segregating at higher frequencies, this bias, in and of itself, does not preclude the use of the MK framework. In addition, low-frequency variants are often removed from MK analyses (Fay et al. 2001 (Fay et al. , 2002 because they contain disproportionately more weakly deleterious mutations. Second, bias can result if a chip developed solely from data from one taxon is applied to others. SNPs on the Affymetrix chip were ascertained in a sample of house mice that included all three subspecies, but there is some evidence of ascertainment bias in SNPs used in this study (Yang et al. 2011) . The average minor allele frequency (MAF) was slightly higher for M. m. domesticus, the subspecies in which the majority of SNPs on the Affymetrix chip were ascertained, than for M. m. castaneus or M. m. musculus (MAF (standard error): M. m. domesticus, synonymous 5 0.242 (0.003), nonsynonymous 5 0.234 (0.007); M. m. castaneus, synonymous 5 0.229 (0.004), nonsynonymous 5 0.214 (0.008); M. m. musculus, synonymous 5 0.203 (0.005), nonsynonymous 5 0.203 (0.008)). However, the average MAF for the other two subspecies was also high, and all three subspecies have appreciable numbers of sites segregating at intermediate frequencies ( supplementary fig. 2 , Supplementary Material online). Finally, because the MK framework compares ratios of synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations, bias in the results due to the manner in which SNPs were chosen would require not only that nonsynonymous or synonymous SNPs were preferentially included on the array but also that this was done differently for the three subspecies, which seems unlikely. Empirical evidence that the conclusions are not strongly biased comes from the comparison of our results for one subspecies (M. m. castaneus) to those of Halligan et al. (2010) who conducted analyses based on DNA sequences sampled from the same populations and obtained similar values of a (see Discussion).",

Variation at each coding site was classified as either synonymous or nonsynonymous based on Ensembl notation (Build 63) of base position in the Mus musculus reference sequence (Build 37). If a site had conflicting overlapping designations, fell within noncoding regions in any transcript or fell within a coding region with no stop or start codon, it was excluded from the analysis. To mitigate the effects of nearly neutral mutations that may contribute proportionally more to polymorphism than to divergence, MK tests are often repeated, excluding polymorphisms that fall below a given threshold (Fay et al. 2001 (Fay et al. , 2002 . Although such an approach is arbitrary, it does address the potential underestimation of a and can be applied to SNP data. We repeated all analyses, counting polymorphic sites only when the MAF exceeded 10% or 20%, levels chosen to represent meaningful differences given the number of alleles sampled.

In addition, changes in N e may bias estimates of a. For example, consider a population that has contracted at some time in the past and then expanded to its current size. Weakly deleterious amino acid mutations may have fixed when the population was smaller, inflating estimates of a (McDonald and Kreitman 1991) . Reductions in N e may produce the opposite result, underestimating a (Eyre-Walker and Keightley 2009) . However, the effects of changes in N e on estimates of a are complex, dependent on the number of mutations that are nearly neutral, and thus difficult to predict (Charlesworth and Eyre-Walker 2006; Eyre-Walker and Keightley 2009) . In this study, all subspecies are believed to have expanded in the recent past as human commensals (Rajabi-Maham et al. 2008) and in M. m. domesticus and M. m. musculus, there is evidence that those expansions were preceded by major contractions (Rajabi-Maham et al. 2008; Duvaux et al. 2011) . The ancestral N e of these subspecies has been estimated at ;400,000-500,000 (Geraldes et al. 2011) and is closest to the estimated current N e of M. m. castaneus. Therefore, changes in N e may lead to overestimates of a in M. m. domesticus and M. m. musculus and underestimates of a in M. m. castaneus (see Discussion). Finally, we note that the wild-caught M. m. castaneus were sampled from the presumed ancestral range of house mice, whereas wildcaught M. m. musculus and M. m. domesticus were sampled from derived populations.",

Notably, it is only in M. m. castaneus that CIs for a did not include zero. Estimates of N e were taken from the literature and are based on data from resequencing studies (supplementary table 1 It is important to note that although a is defined as the contribution of positive selection to amino acid substitution, estimates of a are influenced not only by the ratio of replacement to silent fixed differences but also by the ratio of replacement to silent polymorphism. Therefore, more effective positive selection can be confounded with more effective purifying selection. A simple comparison of the ratios of replacement to silent polymorphisms and ratios of replacement to silent fixations among subspecies in our study suggests that both purifying selection and positive selection are more effective in M. m. castaneus, contributing to higher overall estimates of a (table 1). The ratio of replacement to silent polymorphism, which reflects purifying selection, is lower in M. m. castaneus than in either M. m. musculus or M. m. domesticus, whereas the ratio of replacement to silent fixed differences, which reflects adaptive fixation, is higher in M. m. castaneus than in either M. m. musculus or M. m. domesticus.",

There was evidence for subdivision within our samples of M. m. castaneus and M. m. musculus (see supplementary analyses, Supplementary Material online). However, we estimated a again for both subspecies using the largest sample for which there was no evidence of subdivision (eight individuals for M. m. castaneus and six for M. m. musculus) and found very similar results (supplementary table 4 , Supplementary Material online). Estimates of a for M. m. castaneus ranged from 0.39 to 0.43 and for M. m. musculus from 0.07 to 0.09. Changes in N e could also affect the interpretation of our results. However, the fact that similar patterns were obtained using all the data and when low-frequency polymorphisms were excluded (table 1) suggests that the bias introduced by changes in N e may not be great. In addition, we expanded our sample to include wild-derived inbred lines from a larger geographic range for each subspecies (see supplementary analyses, Supplementary Material online). Although this analysis does not address the impact of changes in N e directly, it does mitigate the potential impact of our sampling on the effects of such changes.

The contribution of positive selection to amino acid divergence is expected to depend on both selective and demographic processes. However, previous comparisons of a among taxa have largely been restricted to groups that are relatively distantly related, varying in aspects of ecology and life history and in N e (but see Jensen and Bachtrog 2011; Strasburg et al. 2011) . In this study, we demonstrate that three closely related taxa with similar ecology and life history show marked variation in a. Furthermore, as reported for fruit flies and sunflowers (Jensen and Bachtrog 2011; Strasburg et al. 2011) , observed variation in estimates of a among house mouse subspecies is consistent with differences in estimates of N e . Our analyses were based on polymorphism and divergence in ascertained SNPs rather than in DNA sequence data, allowing us to survey the genome broadly. Ascertainment bias in a form that could affect our results seems unlikely (see Materials and Methods), and comparison of levels of variation among polymorphic sites in the three subspecies provides evidence that ascertainment was not dramatically different among subspecies. In addition, our results for M. m. castaneus are consistent with previously published estimates of a based on DNA sequence analysis. Halligan et al. (2010) used resequencing data from 77 autosomal loci to estimate a for M. m. castaneus collected from the same geographic region surveyed in our study. Using a variety of different methods, their estimates of a based on comparisons among 0-fold and 4-fold degenerate sites ranged from 0.22 to 0.57. Despite using different outgroups, their estimates are in good agreement with ours (0.37-0.43). However, it is worth considering how ascertainment bias could affect our results. If the SNPs were primarily discovered in M. m. domesticus, then they may be expected to be at higher frequencies in M. m. domesticus than in M. m. castaneus. Since deleterious replacement mutations will mostly be in excess on the low-frequency end, ascertainment bias could result in a higher ratio of replacement to silent polymorphism in the subspecies in which the SNPs were not ascertained. In this case, we observed the opposite pattern: M. m. castaneus has the lowest rates of replacement to silent polymorphism.",

In this study, the potential impact of demography is particularly relevant because of the close relationship between the subspecies. Exploring the relationship between N e and the contribution of positive selection to amino acid substitution using recently diverged taxa has the advantage of minimizing the effects of differing biology. However, recently diverged taxa necessarily share evolutionary history, having evolved together away from the outgroup until the time of their divergence. In this case, the three subspecies of M. musculus diverged from each Adaptive Evolution in Wild House Mice \u2022 doi:10.1093/molbev/mss105 MBE other ;500,000 years ago, whereas they diverged from M. spretus ; 1 Ma. Therefore, the time during which they experienced differences in N e is relatively short. As a result, estimates of a may be particularly influenced by the effects of changes in N e reflected in patterns of polymorphism rather than differences in positive selection reflected in patterns of divergence (Keightley and Eyre-Walker 2012) .",

Because there is limited power for such an approach with this data set, it is important to consider the potential impact of shared evolutionary history and changes in N e on the interpretation of results. Estimates of the ancestral N e range from ;400,000 to ;500,000 (Geraldes et al. 2011) , slightly smaller than estimates of N e for M. m. castaneus and substantially larger than estimates of N e for M. m. musculus or M. m. domesticus. Although increases in N e in M. m. castaneus are predicted to lead to underestimates of a, population contractions in M. m. domesticus and M. m. musculus may have resulted in overestimates of a due to the fixation or near fixation of slightly deleterious mutations segregating prior to the bottlenecks. Both of these potential biases suggest that the inference of more positive selection in M. m. castaneus relative to the other two subspecies is conservative. Nevertheless, specific biases are difficult to predict without more detailed information on the demographic history of the subspecies. The nature of ascertained SNPs prevents the application of methods based on the SFS that have been developed to better account for complex demographic scenarios (Keightley and Eyre-Walker 2007; Eyre-Walker and Keightley 2009) . However, we have attempted to test the robustness of our result repeating our analysis with different thresholds for polymorphism, with subsamples to reduce population subdivision within subspecies, and with additional sampling of wild-derived inbred lines to cover a broader geographic range across the subspecies. We consistently found evidence of a significant contribution of positive selection to amino acid substitution for the subspecies with the largest N e , M. m. castaneus, whereas finding little evidence of positive selection in the other two subspecies.",

The wide range of values for N e for each subspecies reflects uncertainty in the generation time and associated estimates of mutation rate as well as differences in the methods employed. Nonetheless, there is broad agreement between estimates of N e and a; estimates of a and N e are largest in M. m. castaneus, whereas estimates of both N e and a for M. m. musculus and M. m. domesticus are smaller. To account for the variation in N e introduced by differences in assumptions regarding generation time and mutation rate, we plotted estimates of a against published estimates of nucleotide diversity (supplementary table 1, Supplementary Material online) as a proxy for N e(fig. 1).",
