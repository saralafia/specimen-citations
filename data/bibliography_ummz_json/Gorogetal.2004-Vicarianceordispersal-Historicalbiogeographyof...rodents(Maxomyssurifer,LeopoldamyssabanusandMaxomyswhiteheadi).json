    "abstract": "The Sunda region of southeast Asia comprises the Malay Peninsula and the islands of Java, Sumatra and Borneo, all of which lie on a shallow continental shelf projecting from Indochina. Pleistocene glacial cycles caused sea levels to drop repeatedly, exposing vast areas of the Sunda shelf and creating land bridges among the islands and mainland. These land bridges, the latest of which connected all three of the major Sunda islands to the Malay Peninsula as recently as 9500 years ago, may have enabled mammalian migrations across the Sunda shelf. Pleistocene land bridges on the Sunda shelf have been invoked to explain the current distributions of mammalian taxa occupying ranges corresponding with the Pleistocene limits of land and the appearance of new mammal species in the Pleistocene fossil record. The ability of mammals to move throughout the exposed shelf during periods of low sea level would, however, have been influenced by topographic and ecological features, which have been variously described as savanna-like or as moist tropical rain forest. Using a phylogeographical approach, we test the hypothesis that Pleistocene land bridges enabled widespread movements in three rainforest restricted murine rodents of the Sunda shelf: Maxomys surifer, Leopoldamys sabanus and Maxomys whiteheadi. Our results do not support the hypothesis of broad Pleistocene migrations in these taxa, but instead suggest a deep history of vicariant evolution that may correspond with the Pliocene fragmentation of the Sunda block.",

The Indonesian archipelago, in particular, has fascinated biogeographers since Alfred Russell Wallace's pioneering studies in the 1850s documented extremely high levels of diversity in the region and the sharp biogeographical divide between the Sunda islands (the western part of the archipelago) and Sulawesi (Wallace, 1869) . Because they lie on a shallow continental shelf that has been exposed repeatedly to create land bridges between islands in relatively recent geological history (Heaney, 1991; Voris, 2000) , the Sunda islands are distinct from other well-studied island systems such as the Galapagos (Grant, 1999) and are especially interesting for biogeographical studies. The importance of these periodic connections to the evolution of the Sunda shelf fauna has been studied in detail for some groups (e.g. Heaney, 1986 for non-volant mammals; Ruedi & Fumagalli, 1996 for gymnures; Ruedi, 1996 for shrews; Schmitt, Kitchener & How, 1995 The Malay Peninsula and the major islands of Borneo, Java and Sumatra lie on the shallow continental Sunda shelf. These regions existed as a continental block with Indochina from the early Eocene (~50 Mya) to the late Oligocene (~25 Mya), after which Java and Sumatra were submerged until the middle Miocene (~15 Mya). By the early Pliocene (~5 Mya) the Sunda islands had obtained an essentially modern formation. Connections among the islands and peninsula/mainland had disappeared or had been reduced to narrow corridors, although the exact margins of the shallow sea and low-lying adjacent areas are unknown (Hall, 1998) .",

Phenetic tests of faunal similarity and fossil data support the hypothesis of large-scale faunal movements and provide a latest date for a number of colonization events, but neither represents an explicit test of this question. By contrast, a phylogeographical approach in which multiple groups are examined for common patterns of relation-ships across a landscape (Avise et al., 1987) can enable us to reconstruct the evolutionary histories of Sunda shelf rain forest taxa, and thus the history of isolation and fragmentation among forested regions of the shelf. The phylogeographical patterns that emerge from such a reconstruction can provide a test of the hypothesis that Pleistocene land bridges explain current distributional patterns in the Sunda region. The patterns found may also suggest alternative hypotheses.",

The red spiny rat M. surifer is a terrestrial medium-sized murine with a body mass up to 284 g, the long-tailed giant rat L. sabanus is a semiarboreal murine of maximum body mass 532 g, and the spiny mouse M. whiteheadi is a small-bodied terrestrial murine with body mass as great as 83 g (Medway, 1969 (Medway, , 1977 Payne & Francis, 1998) . All three of these taxa prefer forested habitat and appear not to exist commensally with humans, and therefore are unlikely to display phylogeographical patterns that are a result of human-influenced dispersal. Both M. surifer and L. sabanus are found on Borneo, Sumatra, Java, the Malay Peninsula and Indochina. Maxomys whiteheadi has a smaller, Sunda-restricted range: it is found on Borneo, Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula south of the Isthmus of Kra, but is absent from Java (Musser & Carleton, 1993) . The possible multispecies nature of the two taxa with widespread continental and Sunda distributions (M. surifer and L. sabanus) has been mentioned (Musser, Marshall & Boeadi, 1979; Musser, 1981) , but none of these three species has been critically revised.",

Phylogenetic analysis of LINE-1 elements places Maxomys in a clade that is sister to a Leopoldamys/ Niviventer group and another comprising Rattus, Berylmys, Bandicota and Sundamys (Verneau, Catzeflis & Furano, 1998) . Both the distinctiveness of Maxomys and the close relationship of Niviventer and Leopoldamys are consistent with the results of a DNA-DNA hybridization study (Ruedas & Kirsch, 1997) , but again it is important to stress that the sister groups to Maxomys and Leopoldamys will remain ambiguous until comprehensive analyses encompassing the broad diversity of murine genera are performed.",

Borneo, Sumatra, Java and the Malay Peninsula were isolated from one another between 7000 and 9500 years ago. If large-scale migrations occurred periodically until this time, the subsequent period of isolation (7000-9500 years) is unlikely to have resulted in complete lineage sorting and pronounced genetic differentiation among populations in these regions. Hence, the observation of distinct, monophyletic lineages associated with each of these regions in the three taxa studied would reject the hypothesis of migrations up to and through the late Pleistocene. This pattern would instead be consistent with a vicariance scenario, in which M. surifer, L. sabanus and M. whiteheadi share a history of diversification resulting from barriers arising within their formerly continuous ranges.",

Borneo occupies a central position on the Sunda shelf with long coastlines facing all other major regions (Indochina, the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra and Java) and a history of broad Pleistocene connections to these regions. Despite the smaller samples from Sumatra and Java, the sampling of south-western Borneo, southern Sumatra and western Java for M. surifer provides a good test of the monophyly of populations in these regions. The former two may have been connected by riverine gallery forests in the Pleistocene and the latter two are separated today only by the narrow Sunda Straits. The sampling of the other Sunda regions and mainland is not extensive but provides initial evidence concerning our hypotheses; the patterns we find can be tested with additional data in the future.",

Further analyses were conducted in NONA and our initial results rigorously tested using the Parsimony Ratchet (Nixon, 1999b) spawned from Win- clada. By iteratively reweighting a subset of characters, the Ratchet improves the efficiency and speed of tree searching by enabling the search to move from an island of equally most parsimonious trees, where it can become 'mired' in branch-swapping on almost identical trees, to a new island that may possess more parsimonious trees. The trees collected during the iterations of the Ratchet represent a broader sample of tree space than does the sample collected from a single island (Nixon, 1999b) . Each data set was subjected to 10 000 iterations of the Parsimony Ratchet with one starting tree and 15% of the characters reweighted per iteration. Because the Ratchet itself can become stranded on islands of similar trees (Nixon, 1999b) , we also performed a set of analyses in which the data sets were subjected to 1000 iterations of the Ratchet ten times. For each of the taxa studied, heuristic analysis, 10 000 iterations of the parsimony Ratchet and ten repeated Ratchet analyses of 1000 iterations produced the same consensus topologies.",

Sympatric L. sabanus and L. edwardsi from the Malay Peninsula are distinct serologically, immunologically, karyotypically, behaviourally and morphologically (Yong, 1970) . The paraphyly of Indochinese L. sabanus with respect to L. edwardsi may represent a case of mitochondrial introgression (Ferris et al., 1983; Ruedi, Smith & Patton, 1997) or it may be indicative of a greater evolutionary and taxonomic complexity among Leopoldamys species than is currently understood. Although we recognize that more data are required to address this question, this study provides initial insight into the relationships between Sunda shelf L. sabanus and Indochinese populations. A more distant relative, R. norvegicus, was designated as the outgroup and S. muelleri, N. cremoriventer and N. rapit were also included in the analysis.",

A similar pattern of distinct lineages is observed for almost all of the other regions sampled, although more intensive sampling from regions other than Borneo will be needed to provide a rigorous test of, for example, Pleistocene movements between Java and Sumatra in M. surifer and L. sabanus. The analyses of all available data presented here, however, show no evidence of migrations over these land bridges, but rather provide strong support for a deeper history of vicariant diversification. The depths of divergence among regional groups suggest that populations on Borneo, Java and Sumatra were isolated from one another and from the mainland well before the most recent glacial maximum (11 000 years ago) and quite possibly before the Pleistocene. Although we do not attempt a precise dating of the diversification of lineages in M. surifer, L. sabanus and M. whiteheadi, the cyt b data may be useful in obtaining a rough estimate of divergence times among the lineages identified (whereas the control region data, from which multiple hypervariable regions have been pared, are more difficult to consider). A standard molecular clock of 2% Myr -1 for mammalian mitochondrial DNA (Brown et al., 1979) , a rate that is consistent with that estimated from raw differences in Rattus and Mus cyt b sequence calibrated with the fossil split of these two genera (Jacobs & Downs, 1994) , would place the divergences among islands at 3.1-4.7 Mya and between the islands and mainland at 4.8-6.0 Mya. A faster clock, such as the highest average rate for the whole mitochondrial genome (10% Myr -1 ) estimated for species of Mus (She et al., 1990) , would date the island divergences at 0.61-0.93 Mya and the island/mainland divergence at 0.96-1.19 Mya. If regional monophyly were to reflect postglacial vicariance, the rate of change required to account for the levels of divergence observed in our data (up to ~12% in the cyt b data) following isolation only 10 000 years ago is two orders of magnitude greater than would be predicted by either the standard 2% Myr -1 rate calculated for primates (Brown et al., 1979) or the 10% Myr -1 rate calculated for some species of Mus (She et al.

The only information that could be used for this purpose is the geological timing of the fragmentation and reconnection of the Sunda shelf and mainland, events that are not independent of the evolutionary events that we seek to date. Thus, it was not possible to estimate independently the rough ages of the lineages identified without recourse to published rates of divergence in other mammal lineages. Moreover, estimates based on the rough clocks above (ranging from 2 to 10% Myr -1 ) cannot be reconciled with the known date for the last breakup of the shelf and the fragmentation of populations on different islands. A greater understanding of palaeoecological conditions on the Sunda shelf and the timing of changes in these conditions, in addition to the chronology of geological events, is needed to understand the precise timing of the evolution of independent lineages in the taxa studied.",

Although relationships among regional lineages of M. surifer and L. sabanus are not fully resolved, neither displays this pattern. Rather, both show a closer relationship between peninsular and island lineages than between peninsular and Indochinese groups. This pattern was also observed in gymnures (Ruedi & Fumagalli, 1996) and is consistent with the sequential dispersal model proposed by these authors, wherein the mainland source area is represented by the most pleisiomorphic lineage and more recently colonized islands are represented by more derived lineages. However, the observation of this pattern in multiple, unrelated taxa is better explained by the occurrence of an older vicariance event affecting the northern Malay Peninsula followed by the vicariant isolation of island populations. We caution that alternative hypotheses involving postglacial vicariance among the Sunda islands layered onto an earlier vicariant event in the northern Malay Peninsula would also result in a sister group relationship between the Indochina group and the island/peninsula group. Again, to accept this scenario we would necessarily have to accept a rate of mitochondrial evolution in our data that is several orders of magnitude greater than those previously recorded.",

First, they indicate that, at least for these rodent taxa, barriers between Borneo and the other islands and peninsula existed during some periods when Pleistocene land bridges connected these landmasses. This finding is in accordance with accumulating palynological evidence suggesting that the Pleistocene Sunda shelf was cool, arid and covered in large part by savanna-like vegetation (Heaney, 1991; Morley, 1998 Morley, , 2000 ) rather than by contiguous humid tropical forest. Second, the results indicate that, despite apparently inhospitable conditions on much of the exposed shelf, suitable rain forest habitat must have persisted throughout the Pleistocene in each region represented by a distinct lineage in the phylogenetic analyses. Previous studies of animals reached similar conclusions concerning the occurrence of refugia: first, studies of disjunct populations of leaf monkey (Presbytis and Pygathrix), proboscis monkey (Nasalis), loris (Loris and Nycticebus) and gibbon (Hylobates) species concluded that current populations represent relict groups that were confined to rain forest refugia during Pleistocene glacial periods (Brandon-Jones, 1996 ; the refugia suggested by the distributions of these primates are in north-eastern Indochina, northern Sumatra, western Java and northern Borneo. Second, a study of termite community composition found evidence of former refuges in northern Sumatra and northern and eastern Borneo based on information about rain-forest-and savannatype termite faunas (Gathorne-Hardy et al., 2002) . The data presented here suggest the presence of an additional refuge in the Malay Peninsula.",

In M. surifer, haplotypes from the south-western localities (BB, GP and PK) form a clade that is sister to one composed of haplotypes from the north-east (KM). Neither of these clades is represented on any other island or mainland Indochina. In M. whiteheadi, a lineage composed of haplotypes from BB and GP is sister to a lineage composed of those from the north and north-east (TL, TW and KM), and haplotypes from the south-east (BS) appear in both groups. This may be indicative of glacial rain forest fragmentation on Borneo and the restriction of these animals to suitable habitat in the north and south-west of the island. Evidence from some mountainous regions of the Sunda shelf (Newsome & Flenley, 1988; Stuijts, 1993) suggests that these areas were less subject to Pleistocene aridification than lowland areas; the Schwaner Range of south-western Borneo and the topographically complex north may similarly have maintained pockets of moist forest that allowed rain forest mammal populations to persist through glacial maxima. In such a scenario, the mixing of M. whiteheadi northern and south-western lineages in the south-east (at BS) could be indicative of a re-invasion of the south-east following the last glacial maximum. Alternatively, this pattern could result from the persistence of ancestral polymorphisms in the BS animals. The large-bodied arboreal L. sabanus shows no such pattern on Borneo (Fig. 5) ; this taxon instead demonstrates a complete lack of phylogeographical structure on the island, with identical haplotypes found at distant localities in the north and south-west. The differences in the degree of phylogeographical structure on Borneo among the three taxa studied may derive from a greater ability to disperse in forested environments in L. sabanus than in M. surifer and M. whiteheadi. Alternatively, the lack of structure in L. sabanus could indicate that it survived arid periods in a single refugium and subsequently dispersed throughout the island. The dispersal abilities of M. surifer, L. sabanus and M. whiteheadi have not been studied under comparable conditions, nor have the possible influences of Pleistocene habitat fragmentation and refugia on Borneo been examined in populations of small mammals.",

This pattern might indicate limited dispersal between the two regions during glacial maxima.

                "text": "The results presented clearly indicate that island and peninsular populations within M. surifer, L. sabanus and M. whiteheadi were isolated prior to the breakup of the last Pleistocene land bridges, an event that took place 7000-9500 years ago. Although we do not attempt to provide a precise estimate of dates for the origin of distinct regional lineages, we argue that the depths of divergence may be consistent with preglacial events and, thus, that an alternative scenario explaining the colonization of the Sunda shelf and subsequent diversification of these taxa must be considered. Given accumulating evidence that Pleistocene Sunda conditions were inhospitable for rain forest species, we discuss the possibility of an earlier invasion of the Sunda shelf and fragmentation of Sunda island populations. When might the Sunda region have been characterized by (1) broad connections among the islands, peninsula, and mainland and (2) widespread rain forest habitat that would enable the dispersal of the ancestors of these groups throughout their current ranges? What conditions changed that would then isolate the island groups long before the last glacial maximum? Throughout the Miocene, Borneo was connected via the Malay Peninsula to Indochina, and, following their emergence from the seas about 10-15 Mya, to Java and Sumatra as well. These connections persisted for several million years until the beginning of the Pliocene (Hall, 1998) . South-east Asia experienced a perhumid, or extremely moist, climate during the Miocene, with palynological records showing a predominance of rain forest species punctuated by only short maxima of Poaceae pollen representing brief dry intervals. These maxima increased in frequency in the Pliocene (Morley, 2000) . Sediment cores from a 12-Myr record in Lake Baikal indicate that global climatic conditions deteriorated suddenly in the early to mid Pliocene (approximately 3 Mya), when the amplitudes of regular 1-Myr, 0.6-Myr and 0.4-Myr climatic oscillations increased dramatically (Kashiwaya et al., 2001) . Quartz flux records from the Sea of Japan corroborate these findings, with evidence of humid climates at the Miocene-Pliocene boundary and a marked increase in aridification about 2.5 Mya (Dersch & Stein, 1994) . This history of a relatively stable tropical environment through the Miocene followed by the early mid Pliocene deterioration of conditions in south-east Asia may provide an explanation for the vicariant patterns documented above.",

One M. surifer lineage is composed of haplotypes from the coastal side of the northern Annamitique Range, which extends from Laos to southern Vietnam. This area represents a unique biogeographical region from which several new large mammal species have been described in the last decade (e.g. Schaller & Vrba, 1996) . The second lineage is composed of haplotypes from the western side of the range at its southernmost limits.

Fossil evidence supports the early presence of Maxomys and Leopoldamys in the region: the putative sister taxon of Maxomys, the extinct Ratchaburamys ruchae, is known from the late Pliocene to early Pleistocene northern Malay Peninsula (Chaimanee, 1998) . Maxomys is known from early Pleistocene deposits on eastern Java on the basis of a single molar (van der Meulen & Musser, 1999) . Furthermore, M. surifer has been recorded from early to mid Pleistocene deposits south of the Isthmus of Kra (Chaimanee, 1998) . Leopoldamys minutus, an extinct relative of L. sabanus, appears in late Pliocene to early Pleistocene deposits in the northern Malay Peninsula, and L. sabanus is known from the mid Pleistocene Kra region (Chaimanee, 1998) . These fossil data corroborate the hypothesis of an early, preglacial presence of M. surifer and L. sabanus and their close relatives in the peninsular Sunda region.",

Differences in the Sunda and Indochinese faunas on either side of the isthmus have been noted at both taxonomic and intraspecific levels in many groups: in lowland birds (Wells, 1971; Medway & Wells, 1976) and amphibians (Inger, 1966) the isthmus represents a peak in the number of species limits of taxa associated with Indochina and those associated with the Sunda shelf. In murid rodents, 11 of the 17 species found in peninsular Malaysia have their northernmost limits at the Isthmus of Kra (Musser & Newcomb, 1983) , and at least one of these (N. cremoriventer) is the sister taxon of an Indochinese species (Musser, 1973) . Of the six that are found in Indochina as well, populations of Berylmys bowersi, Chiropodomys gliroides, M. surifer, L. sabanus and L. edwardsi north and south of the isthmus are morphologically distinct (Musser et al., 1979; Musser, 1979 Musser, , 1981 .",

Some of the phylogenetic results ( Fig. 4 in M. surifer and Fig. 8 in M. whiteheadi) suggest that Borneo was isolated first, and that connections between the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra (and Java, in the former case) were maintained for an additional period, resulting in a deep split between the Bornean and other Sunda lineages.",

Thus, in this scenario, the phylogenetic patterns we observed and the high levels of genetic differentiation are the result of several million years of isolation.",

Greater sampling and additional data, including nuclear DNA sequence and morphology, are required to conduct additional tests of regional monophyly and to assess the depth of divergences -indeed, to test if the lineages observed here may represent distinct species. However, the results clearly refute the hypothesis of widespread migration across the Late Pleistocene Sunda shelf and suggest a deeper history of preglacial vicariance in south-east Asia for M. surifer, L. sabanus and M. whiteheadi. These results challenge a long-standing idea that Pleistocene glacial cycles commonly erased pre-existing evolutionary and distributional patterns, and that the patterns we observe today are the results of these relatively recent events. The vicariance patterns observed in this study more likely have their roots in the Pliocene fragmentation of the Sunda block. support in the field and throughout the writing of this manuscript.
