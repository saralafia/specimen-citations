                "text": "The mammalian X and Y chromosomes presumably evolved from an homologous autosomal pair soon after the origin of mammals. Distinguishable sex chromosomes are found in monotremes, marsupials, and in eutherian (placental) mammals (for review, see Graves 1995 ). There is conservation of genes on the X chromosome across these taxonomic groups, suggesting a single origin of the mammalian X (and Y) chromosomes (Ohno 1967) . Over time, segments of homologous autosomes are thought to have been translocated to both the X and Y chromosomes. Eventually most of these segments lost recombination, and many Y genes deteriorated (for review, see Graves 1995) . Lahn and Page (1999) measured K S , the synonymous evolutionary distance, between related genes on the human X and Y chromosomes, and discovered that the distances fell into four distinct groups referred to as \"strata.\" Remarkably, the groups corresponded to the order of the genes along the human X chromosome. They hypothesized that sequential inversions of segments of the mammalian Y chromosome could have formed the four X chromosomal strata by ending recombination between groups of contiguous X chromosomal genes and their Y chromosomal homologs. These formerly recombining X-Y gene pairs will be referred to as gametologs, as suggested by Garcia-Moreno and Mindell (2000) . An inversion is probably not responsible for the formation of the fourth stratum, because the break between strata three and four in human, chimpanzee, squirrel monkey, ring-tailed lemur, greater bushbaby, cow, pig, and horse is within an intron of the AMGX (also called AMELX) gene (Iwase et al. 2001 (Iwase et al. , 2003 .",

The fourth stratum is hypothesized to have been formed after the divergence of simian and prosimian lineages (30-50 Mya; Lahn and Page 1999) .

Because the mouse X chromosome is rearranged relative to the human X, strata in mice are not found in physical or genetic map order along the mouse X ( Fig. 1) . Instead, they are recognized by their similar K S values ( Table 1) . The M. musculus K S values are higher than the human K S values for the same gene pairs (Fig. 3 ). This probably reflects the higher neutral mutation rate in mice after the human and mouse divergence (Wu and Li 1985 ; Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium 2002). The K S values are similar to those published for some of the same mouse genes (Utx/y, Zfx/y, Usp9x/y, Ube1x/ Ube1y1; Hall et al. 2003) . The visually apparent breaks between strata were statistically significant between strata 2 and 3, but not between strata 1 and 2. Smcx was the only mouse gene that did not fit into the same stratum as in human. As the difference between the strata was slightly below the P < 0.05 significance level (P = 0.0672 in two-tailed tests), more research in other organisms will be needed to determine whether Smcx belongs in stratum 1 or 2. If Smcx is in stratum 1, it may be X-linked in monotremes. To be sure that Smcx/y in M. musculus is representative of the genus Mus, a small fragment of this gene pair was examined in other Mus species. Surprisingly, this smaller (657-nt) fragment had a lower K S (0.661) than the whole gene. The Smcx/y fragment's low K S was similar in all of the Mus species examined. Similarly, another partial (1764-nt) fragment of Smcx/y from M. musculus had a K S of 0.696 (Hall et al. 2003) , which is also low compared to the K S of the whole coding sequence.",

First, the shorter fragments may, by chance, have a lower neutral mutation rate. Second, Smcx/y may cross the breakpoint between two strata, as was discovered in the case of the AMGX/Y gene pair in humans (Iwase et al. 2001) . This possibility was examined by calculating synonymous differences (p) for 100-nt windows of exon sequences. If there were a breakpoint between two strata within the gene, we would expect to see a step-like rise or fall in p along the sequence, which would not reverse itself. Instead, p begins high at the 5\u0408 end of the gene, falls in exon 23, and rises again in the 3\u0408 exons (Fig. 2) . Because p falls, then rises again, Smcx/y probably does not span a stratum boundary. A third explanation is gene conversion in exon 23. If Smcx is a stratum 1 gene as it appears to be in mice, a gene conversion event at about the time of the formation of stratum 2 (130-170 Mya) may account for the synonymous divergence pattern of Smcx and Smcy.",

Thus, this gene pair is expected to have diverged with other stratum 2 genes 130-170 Mya (Lahn and Page 1999) , in the ancestor of human and mouse. Our data suggest that Eif2s3y was probably lost secondarily from primates. Rps4x is X-linked in mice, but Rps4y is not found on the mouse Y chromosome (Omoe and Endo 1996) . Rps4y has been found in human, macaque, and opossum, but not in pig, cow, dog, horse, rabbit, or rat (Jegalian and Page 1998) . Because RPS4X is in stratum 1 in humans and Rps4y is found in opossum, it must have been ancestral in mammals, but may have been lost early in the mammalian radiation. As more X and Y chromosomal genes are sequenced in other species, a more complex history of the formation of the strata will be constructed, including gene pairs such as Eif2s3x/y and Rps4x/y that have been secondarily lost from some mammalian lineages.",

As Lahn and Page (1999) suggested, this is additional evidence supporting Foster and Graves's (1994) hypothesis that the sex chromosomes were formed, and the other sex chromosomal genes diverged, after the differentiation of Sox3 to form Sry. Because only the HMG box region of Sox3 and Sry are alignable, only 231 nt could be compared in mice. Our analysis of a 657-nt fragment of Smcx/y shows that one part of a larger gene may not reflect the behavior of the whole. Therefore, we suggest that the results of analyses of Sox3 and Sry should be interpreted with caution. When the genomic sequence for the mouse Y chromosome is published, it will be interesting to compare the X and Y sequences to each other, as has been done by Iwase et al. (2003) with human X and Y sequences. Those authors found that the percent nucleotide divergence between the sequences increased at the boundaries between the pseudoautosomal region and stratum 4, as well as at the boundary between stratum 4 and stratum 3. It may be more difficult to make alignments between large noncoding regions of the sex chromosomes in mouse than it was in human, because the mouse X and Y sequences have diverged more rapidly than the human sequences (e.g., the K S of a gametologous pair in mouse is higher than it is for the same pair in human; Fig. 3 ). We were unable to align mouse Smcx/y introns unambiguously, and Hall et al. (2003) report being unable to align mouse Zfx/y introns. We may find that mouse noncoding regions have diverged greatly over time, particularly in the older strata.",

Evidence from studies of birds (Garcia-Moreno and Mindell 2000; Ellegren and Carmichael 2001) and plants (Atanassov et al. 2001) , which evolved sex chromosomes independently from mammals, is also consistent with the evolution of their sex chromosomes in strata. Only two gametologous gene pairs have been studied on the bird W-Z chromosomes, and a separate two pairs on the plant X-Y, and so although the evidence does not conflict with the strata hypothesis, neither does it show more than that the gene pairs did not diverge at exactly the same time. To be a convincing demonstration for strata formation on the X chromosome in these organisms, it would be necessary to identify more than one gene pair per stratum in birds and plants. If found, it will suggest a common mechanism for the independent evolution of heteromorphic sex chromosomes across a broad phylogenetic spectrum.",

For the analysis of multiple species of Mus, Zfx and Zfy-2 were taken from Tucker et al. (2003) . (GenBank acc. nos. for Zfy-2, AY159976-AY159980, AY159983, and AY159987; for Zfx, AY160013-AY160018 and AY160022, see Table 3 ). Smcx and Smcy sequences of several Mus species were collected using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing. The genus Mus is a member of the rodent family Muridae and the subfamily Murinae, the Old-world Mice and Rats. Muridae is the largest mammalian family, containing 281 genera and 1326 species (Musser and Carleton 1993) . DNA was collected from seven Mus species and subspecies (Table 3) .",

The statistical significance of the boundaries between these clusters was determined using twotailed Z tests comparing the smallest value in a cluster with the largest value in the cluster immediately below it. Iwase et al. (2001) used nonoverlapping 100-nt windows to determine whether there were differences in the synonymous divergence across the AMGX/Y gene. We made a similar analysis of 100-nt windows of Smcx/y sequence from Mus musculus, using the Nei-Gojobori (1986) uncorrected (p) distance method in MEGA 2.1 (Kumar et al. 2001) . Intron sequences from Smcx/y could not be aligned unambiguously, and thus only exon synonymous sites were used in this analysis.",
