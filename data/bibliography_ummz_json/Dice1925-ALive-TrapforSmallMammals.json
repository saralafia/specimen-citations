Not only does this slope receive the full force of the sun's rays, which thereby melt the winter snows within a short time after they fall, but there is a prevailing southwest wind that usually sweeps loose snow away. Hence many of the rocks of this slide are bare most of the time even during severe weather. Wherever the conies can reach these bare spots and sun themselves in a warm nook sheltered from. the wind, they do so throughout the winter. I have seen them out repeatedly on mild winter days and on-February 7, 1921, they were out on a bright, sunny morning when the temperature was actually far below zero Fahrenheit. Although feet of conies are well protected, they do not seem to like to cross snow. Nevertheless ",
