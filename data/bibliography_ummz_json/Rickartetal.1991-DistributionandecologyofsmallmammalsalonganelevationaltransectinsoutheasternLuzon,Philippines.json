    "abstract": "Small mammals were surveyed along an elevational transect on Mount Isarog (summit at 1,966 m) in southeastern Luzon, Philippines. Removal trapping was conducted at six sites ranging from remnant dipterocarp forest (475 m) to mossy forest (1,750 m). A total of 255 small mammals was captured in 9,001 trap nights. Species captured were one shrew (Crocidura grayi) and seven rodents (Apomys musculus, Apomys cf. microdon, Archboldomys luzonensis, Batomys sp., Chrotomys gonzalesi, Rattus everetti, and Rhynchomys isarogensis). Five species are nocturnal, one diurnal, and two have variable diel activity. On the basis of trap success with two kinds of bait, analysis of stomach contents, and captive feeding trials, we recognize four trophic groups: omnivorous (three species), insectivorous (two species), granivorous-frugivorous (one species), and vermivorous (two species). Species richness and relative abundance followed predicted patterns of increase with elevation. Four species endemic to Mount Isarog were found only at high elevations. The influence of elevation and associated climatic and biotic characteristics on local variation in animal community structure is well recognized. For many vertebrate groups, species richness and relative abundance vary with elevation (Diamond, 1972; Graham, 1983; Heaney et aI., 1989; Terborgh, 1977). However, the ubiquity of elevational patterns and the underlying processes promoting them are unclear, and appear to vary with geographic region, taxonomic group, and trophic assemblage (Heaney et aI., 1989; Patterson et aI., 1989). An understanding of these topics is limited in part by the paucity of standardized surveys along elevational transects that provide data needed to identify patterns and investigate underlying prOcesses. The need to conduct such surveys is accentuated by the rapid destruction of forest communities, particularly in the tropics. In the Philippines, where the basic ecology of most mammals remains unknown, primary forest cover has been reduced from ca. 60% of the total land area in 1945 to ca. 8% currently (Myers, 1988). Our goal in this and other recent studies has been to document the ecology of Philippine mammals while some large tracts of forest remain, to develop and evaluate procedures that allow rapid but accurate assessment of local faunas, and to investigate general ecological and evolutionary phenomena (Heaney, 1986; Heaney and Rickart, 1990). Luzon, the largest island in the Philippine Archipelago, supports a remarkable array of endemic murid rodents. First documented by Thomas (1895, 1898), this fauna is now known to include 24 species representing 14 genera. Twenty of these species are restricted to Luzon (Heaney, 1986). The Luzon fauna is also noteworthy for its broad range of morphological diversity, with arboreal, scansorial, and semifossorial species ranging from 20 g to > 2 kg (Musser, 1982b; Sanborn, 1952; Thomas, 1898). However, in the century following their initial discovery, little information was forthcoming on the ecology of most species. Between 1 March and 7 May 1988 we surveyed small mammals along an elevational transect in Mount Isarog National Park, on the Camarines Peninsula, Camarines Sur Province, southeastern Luzon Island. Mount Isarog is an extinct volcano surrounded by lowland plains. Rising to 1,966 m, it is one of the highest and most isolated forested peaks in southern Luzon. Previous work on Mount Isarog (Rabor, 1966) yielded two new taxa of murid rodents, Archboldomys luzonensis and Rhynchomys isarogensis (Musser, 1982b; Musser and Freeman, 1981). We trapped eight species of non volant small mammals, including seven murid rodents and one soricid insectivore.

Limited data from the central Philippines indicate that mid-elevation mountain regions (800-1,100 m) receive up to 3 times as much rainfall as adjacent lowlands . Therefore, average annual precipitation high on the mountain probably exceeds 500 cm. During our study, rain was frequent and often heavy, and soils generally were saturated in March. In late April and early May, rain was infrequent, mean subcanopy air temperatures were higher, and lower elevations were conspicuously drier. On rainless days, however, areas above 1,500 m elev. had regular, dense fog with high nocturnal condensation on all surfaces. During the study period, subcanopy air temperature ranges (measured 1.5 m above ground surface) were l7.5-30\u00b0C at 475 m and 10.0-23.9\u00b0C at 1,750 m elev.",

Remnant dipterocarp forest below 800 m was heavily disturbed and confined to river banks, but was contiguous with primary forest at higher elevations.

Trees growing on the steepest slopes had horizontal main trunks bearing vertical branches that formed the low canopy. Dominant trees included species of Lauraceae with small lobate, serrate, or lanceolate leaves, and large, branching tree ferns. All surfaces below the canopy were covered with thick mats of moss and liverworts.",

Other traps were placed on fallen trees, horizontal branches, and in other elevated situations to 2 m above the ground surface. Individual traplines of 30-50 traps typically were operated for 4 consecutive days, occasionally for 3-5 days. Traps were examined and rebaited immediately after dawn and in late afternoon, and occasionally were examined at other times during the day.

                "text": "There was significant variation in the proportional abundance of species between the six elevationalsites (G-test; G = 222.02, d.!. = 35, P < 0.005). Crociduragrayi, Apomys d. microdon, and Rattus everetti occurred either over the entire transect or at five of the six sites, Apomys musculus and Rhynchomys isarogensis occurred in montane and mossy forest at 1,125 m and above, and Archboldomys luzonensis, Batomys sp., and Chrotomys gonzalesi occurred at 1,350 m and above (Table 1) . Comparisons of capture frequencies at low-, middle-, and high-elevation pairs of sites (representing dipterocarp forest, montane forest, and mossy forest habitat zones, respectively) showed significant elevational biasing for several species (X 2 tests, expected frequencies based on number of trap nights). Rattus everetti was most abundant in low-elevation dipterocarp forest, Crocidura grayi and Apomys musculus in middle-elevation montane forest, and Batomys sp. and Rhynchomys isarogensis in high-elevation mossy forest (Table 1) . Number of species trapped per site ranged from two at 900 m to eight at 1,350 m elev. At 900 m and 1,550 m, the presence of rare species was inferred from their occurrence at both higher and lower elevations (Table 1) . Although the number of species per site was not significantly correlated with elevation (rs = 0.80, P > 0.05), a strong positive trend was indicated by the significant association between ranked elevation and ranked species richness (P < 0.05, Olmstead-Tukey test- Sokal and Rohlf, 1969) . The two types of bait provided two separate measures of relative abundance of small mammals along the transect, both expressed as percent trap success (number of animals trapped per 100 trap nights). There was a significant positive rank correlation between elevation and trap success with earthworm bait (Table 2) . Conversely, there was a trend toward a negative correlation between elevation and trap success with coconut bait. For Rattus everetti alone (the most common species, accounting for nearly one-half of all captures), the negative correlation between elevation and trap success with coconut bait was significant ( for the two bait types), were not significantly correlated with elevation (Table 2) . However, deletion of the anomalous l,550-m site resulted in a significant correlation for unweighted overall success for the remaining sites (rs = 0.90, P < 0.05). The fact that total capture frequencies in montane and mossy forest habitats were significantly higher than expected (Table 1) also indicated a general increase in overall abundance with elevation. Substantial differences in trap success were noted between the two trapping sessions. At the 1,350and l,750-m sites, success with coconut bait was significantly higher during the second session (Table 3 ). Compared to adjacent sites, the l,550-m site was anomalous in that trap success with both baits was consistently low (Table 3) . The same eight species were recorded in both sessions (Table 4) , and the rank orders for number of captures with coconut bait were significantly correlated between sessions (rs = 0.755, P < 0.05). Most individual sites yielded similar numbers of species during the two sessions. However, rare species were added to the three highest elevational sites during the second session. The 1,550-m site also was anomalous in this respect, with a three-fold increase in the number of species captured during the second session (Fig. 1) . For some species, there was significant temporal variation in trap success. For Crocidura grayi, Batomys sp., and Apomys musculus, trap success with coconut bait was higher during the second session, Trap success with earthworm bait was higher during the first session for Crocidura grayi and Chrotomys gonzalesi (Table 4) . There were significant differences in diel activity patterns of six species (X 2 tests, assuming equal probabilities of nocturnal-crepuscular capture and diurnal capture), Both species of Apomys, Batomys sp., Rattus everetti, and Rhynchomys isarogensis were predominantly nocturnal, whereas Archboldomys luzonensis was diurnal. Crocidura grayi and Chrotomys gonzalesi were active day and night (Table 5) .",

Observations on general morphology and behavior of captive animals indicate that the two vermivorous species use different foraging modes. Chrotomys gonzalesi, with relatively strong forelimbs and a robust skull, is probably semifossorial, whereas Rhynchomys isarogensis is more gracile, has stronger hindlimbs, and is an agile jumper. Earthworms sampled at the five primary-forest sites (900-1,750 m) were members of the acaecate group of genera in the family Megascolecidae (S. James, pers. comm.). Estimated density of earthworms increased progressively with elevation, for a perfect rank correlation (2, 6, 18, 20 , and 32 worms/m2 ; r. = 1.0, P < 0.05). Total sampled biomass varied in a parallel, but not identical fashion \u00ab1,2.5,5.0,12.5, and 22.0 g, respectively), and the number of null samples (of 30) declined with elevation (26, 23, 9, 9, and 1, respectively). High densities of earthworms in mossy forest also were evident from the abundance of fresh casts on the ground surface. Among the five primary forest sites, earthworm abundance and percent trap success with worm Species varied in reproductive condition during the 2-month period of study. Adult Batomys sp. were reproductively inactive. Rattus everetti also was non breeding, although by the end of the study (early May) reproductive tracts of adults taken at 475 m were undergoing recrudescence. The remaining six species exhibited some reproductive activity (large testes, pregnancies, and lactation). For Rhynchomys isarogensis, simultaneous presence of females in early pregnancy, lactating females, and independent juvenile animals indicated a long breeding season.",

That the number of species recorded for the mountain reached an asymptote early in the study (Fig. 1, bottom graph) indicates that the presence of additional species was highly unlikely. Had our early survey efforts been evenly distributed over the entire transect (rather than concentrating in the species-poor lowlands), the total would have been reached much sooner.

Ambient conditions favorable to earthworms include high relative humidity, moderate temperatures, and abundant organic detritus (Lee, 1985) . These conditions continuously prevail in high-elevation tropical forests. On Mount Isarog, earthworms reached peak densities in mossy forest. A study on Borneo showed similar results, with greatest numbers and biomass of earthworms occurring in montane forest between 1,000 and 1,900 m elev. (Collins, 1980) . Unfortunately, we have no direct data on the seasonality of earthworm abundance along our transect. However, the high densities we recorded occurred during the driest (and presumably least favorable) portion of the year. This indicates that densities may remain high and relatively stable year-round. If true, this would affect the life histories of vermivorous mammals. That Chrotomys gonzalesi and Rhynchomys tsarogensis were reproductively active when some non-vermivores (Batomys sp. and Rattus everetti) were inactive indicates that the vermivores may be less influenced by resource seasonality.",

Three of these concern nonvolant small mammals. A predicted pattern of increasing species richness with elevation is supported by data from Mount Isarog that demonstrate maximum species richness in montane and mossy forest, with lower richness in lowland forest (Table  1) . This contrasts with the widespread pattern seen for bats (Chiroptera) and birds, where maximum species richness occurs in lowland forest (Diamond, 1972; Graham, 1983; Heaneyet aI., 1989; Terborgh, 1977) .",

Our trapping data on murids provide partial support for this prediction. Rattus everettt, the only murid on Mount Isarog not a member of an endemic Philippine genus (Musser, 1982b) , was also the only small mammal species that reached peak abundance in lowland forest (Table 1) .",

On this basis we make the additional prediction that on old, species-rich islands, small-mammal communities at high elevations should consist predominantly of local endemics, including species with relatively specialized trophic adaptations. Additional studies in the Philippines and elsewhere in Indo-Australia would help to clarify these patterns and the processes promoting them.",
