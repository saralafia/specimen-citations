However, the relationship of these phenomena to functional organization of the genome in the context of reproductive isolation remains unexplored. Here, we examine genomic characteristics of the species boundaries between two house mouse subspecies (Mus musculus musculus/M. m. domesticus). These taxa form a narrow semipermeable zone of secondary contact across Central Europe. Due to the incomplete nature of reproductive isolation, gene flow in the zone varies across the genome. We present an analysis of genomic differentiation, rate of recombination, and functional composition of genes relative to varying amounts of introgression. We assessed introgression using 1,316 autosomal single nucleotide polymorphism markers, previously genotyped in hybrid populations from three transects. We found a significant relationship between amounts of introgression and both genomic differentiation and rate of recombination with genomic regions of reduced introgression associated with higher genomic differentiation and lower rates of recombination, and the opposite for genomic regions of extensive introgression. We also found a striking functional polarization of genes based on where they are expressed in the cell. Regions of elevated introgression exhibit a disproportionate number of genes involved in signal transduction functioning at the cell periphery, among which olfactory receptor genes were found to be the most prominent group. Conversely, genes expressed intracellularly and involved in DNA binding were the most prevalent in regions of reduced introgression. We hypothesize that functional organization of the genome is an important driver of species divergence.",

                "text": "Thanks to advances in high-throughput technologies research on the genetics of speciation has shifted in the last few years from a study of a few genes to a study of whole genomes. The shift from the genic to genomic level enables us to better understand the patterns of genomic differentiation between diverging species which ultimately give rise to reproductive isolation (Nosil and Feder 2012) . Genomic regions of high differentiation-varyingly referred to in the literature as \"islands of speciation\" or \"islands of differentiation\" (Turner et al. 2005; Harr 2006; Nosil et al. 2009 )have been attributed to limited gene flow due to reduced recombination and/or diversifying selection in sympatry (reviewed in Butlin 2005; Feder et al. 2012) . Alternatively, genomic regions of high differentiation may result from the faster sorting of alleles due to selection at linked sites in allopatry (Noor and Bennett 2009; Nachman and Payseur 2012; Cruickshank and Hahn 2014) . Reduced recombination is viewed in both scenarios to play an important role in species divergence. However, its role in the evolution of reproductive isolation is still unclear.",

For example, Ruegg et al. (2014) , studying two parapatric species of songbirds, reported no overlap between loci linked to putative isolating traits and genome differentiation. In this study, genome differentiation was attributed to reduced recombination. Ellegren et al. (2012) found no overlap between regions of high differentiation and reduced recombination for parapatric populations of flycatchers. Interestingly, Renaut et al. (2013) found the same genomic regions of high differentiation between pairs of sympatric as well as allopatric populations of sunflowers. These authors attributed differences in differentiation across the genome to heterogeneous rates of recombination, possibly associated with the functional organization of the genome.",

The majority of these genes were identified in the genus Drosophila (Sawamura and Yamamoto 1997; Ting et al. 1998; Barbash et al. 2003; Presgraves et al. 2003; Brideau et al. 2006; Bayes and Malik 2009; Ferree and Barbash 2009; Phadnis and Orr 2009; Tang and Presgraves 2009) . The only mammalian speciation gene (Prdm9) identified to date is in the house mouse system (Mihola et al. 2009) . Functionally, these genes are often involved in DNA binding (Presgraves 2010) and thus they may be a cause of Dobzhansky-Muller Incompatibilities (DMIs; Dobzhansky 1936; Muller 1940 Muller , 1942 Coyne and Orr 2004) . Some authors hypothesize that they are likely to be involved in various forms of genetic conflict (reviewed in Presgraves 2010) . Despite these recent advances, there has been no systematic study assessing the role of the higher functional organization of the genome in species differentiation and in the evolution of reproductive isolation.",

However, as Duvaux et al. (2011) pointed out, there has still been enough time in allopatry for incompatibilities to evolve. Indeed, there is substantial evidence for intrinsic postzygotic reproductive isolation from laboratory crosses (Forejt and Iv anyi 1974; Storchov a et al. 2004; Britton-Davidian et al. 2005; Good, Dean, et al. 2008; Good, Handel, et al. 2008; White et al. 2011) as well as from wild-sampled hybrid individuals (Turner et al. 2011; Albrechtov a et al. 2012) , in both cases affecting mostly males.

The genomic regions of reduced introgression exhibit a lower male-specific (MS) rate of recombination and higher genomic differentiation, the opposite of regions with elevated introgression. Also, we found striking differences in the functional composition of genes with respect to amounts of introgression. Genomic regions of high introgression tend to have a higher prevalence of genes with functions associated with cell surface and signal transduction, whereas genomic regions of reduced introgression tend to have a higher prevalence of genes with their functions acting at the intracellular level and most notably in transcription factor activity. Our work thus supports recent findings on the importance of genomic functional organization in species divergence (Renaut et al. 2013; Ruegg et al. 2014) and is the first to report these patterns for mammals. In addition, our work suggests that functional characteristics and their distribution in the genome may also be important in the evolution of reproductive isolation in the house mouse. We find that some functional classes of genes are more prone to be involved in reproductive isolation and other classes are more prone to cross species boundaries.",

We found a considerable number of outliers, both positive and negative values, for both parameters (, ) (table 1; see fig. 2 for examples of genomic clines). The distributions of the actual and parameter values merged over the five Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chains along with their most conservative credible intervals are provided (supplementary fig.

The parameter exhibited more outliers for positive parameter values (i.e., those under putative selection against hybrids) than outliers for negative parameter values (i.e., those which escape the effect of a reproductive barrier). This may result from using differentially fixed SNP markers between two house mouse subspecies which may bias marker choice to those with reduced amounts of introgression (i.e., those under putative selection in the house mouse hybrid zone). The size of credible intervals (supplementary fig.

For negative parameter values, parameter values are generally deviating from zero, the lower the parameter, the greater the deviation of the parameter from zero. In general, this means that genomic clines for markers associated with parts of the genome under selection against hybrids do not shift their position from the genome-wide expectation. This observation is likely a result of coincidence of markers associated with genes involved in reproductive isolation. In contrast, markers associated with genomic regions which freely cross the hybrid zone, that is, those that are not affected by reproductive barriers, tend to be shifted on either side of the genomewide expectation. We also found significant differences between the three transects. The CZ and SX transects exhibited generally more symmetry with their negative tails having both positive and negative values, with the SX transect having the inverted U-shaped curve wider likely as a result of higher variation in the data due to poorer sampling in this transect. The BV transect was rather asymmetric with negative values having mostly positive . This discrepancy between the BV and the other two transects can be explained by their different dynamics as shown by Wang et al. (2011) , that is, the BV transect exhibits genome-wide patterns suggesting hybrid zone movement in the direction of the M. m. domesticus range. In figure 3, the BV transect lacks SNP markers having negative and introgression into M. m. musculus range ( < 0). Wang et al. (2011) showed that the BV transect has moved as a result of demographic changes in a westward direction (i.e., into M. m. domesticus range) and as such it has left behind a footprint comprising genomic regions not involved in reproductive isolation. This interferes with distinguishing potential adaptively introgressing alleles from the ones that remain behind as the zone is moving.",

For models with a significant effect for the parameter category, the genomic differentiation for SNP markers which do not cross the house mouse hybrid zone tends to be higher than for those corresponding to the genome-wide expectation. The opposite is true for SNP markers which cross the hybrid zone more extensively than the genome-wide expectation, even though the difference is not as pronounced as for SNP markers with reduced amounts of introgression. For rate of recombination on the 1-Mb window scale, the difference in explanatory power between the model with the parameter as a fixed effect and the model without this effect was largest and statistically significant for the MS recombination map and less so, though still significant, for the sex-averaged (SA) recombination map. There was no difference for the female-specific (FS) recombination map (MS: LL null =\u00c0639.6, LL = \u00c0632.5, LLR = 14.16, P = 8 E-04; SA: LL null = \u00c0256.2, LL = \u00c0251.2, LLR = 9.974, P = 0.0068, FS: LL null = \u00c0774.5, LL = \u00c0772.5, LLR = 3.899, P = 0.1423; supplementary table S5, Supplementary Material online).

No effect was found for the FS rate of recombination ( fig. 4B and  supplementary fig. S4B , Supplementary Material online). For SA and MS rates of recombination, we found that SNP markers exhibiting limited introgression tend to be associated with a lower rate of recombination than those with introgression corresponding to the genome-wide expectation in the BV and SX transects. In contrast, SNP markers with greater amounts of introgression tend to be associated with rates of recombination that are higher than the genome-wide expectation.

Based on 1,000 bootstraps we found this distinction to be significant (supplementary fig.  S5A , Supplementary Material online). The similar functional distinction between categories was also found using other agglomerative clustering methods (supplementary fig. S5B , Supplementary Material online). The average-linkage and complete-linkage agglomerative methods provided very good resolution between the negative and the other two categories. The single-linkage method provided a less clear picture; however, this method is generally considered to be more sensitive to outliers (Tan et al. 2005) . We also conducted a principal component analysis on GO profiles, identifying again a clear distinction between the gene lists of negative and the other two categories (supplementary fig. S5C , Supplementary Material online). Further, we constructed a heat map based on GO profiles to visualize differences in individual GO terms between gene lists of various categories ( fig. 5A ). We found that some GO terms that are prevalent in gene lists associated with negative values are rare in the other two categories and vice versa. This pattern was the most pronounced in two clusters (#112 and #113; supplementary fig. S8A , Supplementary Material online) consisting of 7 and 24 GO terms, respectively, with a considerable number of them having significantly higher/lower prevalence for various window sizes (P 0.05; fig. 5B ). For other GO terms (e.g., #114 with 86 GO terms; supplementary fig. S8A , Supplementary Material online) , the contrast between the categories was less striking or none. We explored all terms with their P values equal or lower than 0.05 as we were looking for trends and consistencies between transects and window sizes. Nevertheless, we considered two other more conservative thresholds (P 0.01, P 0.001) and found the most prominent GO terms significant in at least one transect (data not shown). 4 .

Genomic differentiation was plotted for three window sizes (250, 500 kb, and 1 Mb) and rate of recombination was plotted for three conditions (SA, MS, and FS). The average estimates with 95% confidential intervals were plotted along with significance (***P 0.001; **P 0.01; *P 0.05) of the effect of the category for each transect separately. Significance of the category effect over all three transects is plotted as well. All of the measures were estimated using mixed-effect linear models where individual markers were nested within genomic regions to treat for underlying linkage structure (see Materials and Methods). Rate of recombination was transformed using a Box-Cox transformation to normalize the data.

Genes associated with SNP markers of negative are mainly associated with GO terms such as plasma membrane (GO:0005886), intrinsic to membrane (GO:0031224), cellular response to stimulus (GO:0051716), cell periphery (GO:0071944), and signal transducer activity (GO:0004871). These GO terms are rarer for genes associated with SNP markers with a positive or a equal to zero. This suggests that genes in genomic regions introgressing at a higher rate than the genomewide expectation tend to act mainly at the cell periphery. The only exception is the BV transect, for which genomic regions with greater amounts of introgression ( < 0) differed slightly in function from the other two transects. As mentioned earlier, the asymmetry in the BV transect due to hybrid zone movement reported by Wang et al. (2011) might have caused problems in distinguishing adaptive introgression. Despite the difference, both hierarchical clustering and principal component analyses grouped genomic regions exhibiting a greater amount of introgression ( < 0) in the BV transect with the other two transects ( fig. 5A and supplementary fig. S5 , Supplementary Material online). In contrast, genes associated with SNP markers of positive or equal to zero tend to act mainly at the intracellular level as suggested by GO terms such as intracellular (GO:0005622), intracellular organelle (GO:0043229), and intracellular part (GO:0044424). As for GO terms that would distinguish between genes associated with SNP markers of positive and those with equal to zero, we found sequence-specific DNA binding transcription activity (GO:0003700) as the GO term most consistently showing higher prevalence for genes associated with SNP markers of positive . Given the polarization of GO terms, we suggest that the underlying functional structure of the genome is an important player in forming the species genomic boundaries.",

The relationship very likely reflects the nature of hybrid zones as described by theoretical models (Barton 1983 ; Barton and Bengtsson 1986; Bierne et al. 2011) . In general, we found that SNP markers with steeper clines form the center of the hybrid zone with no shift from the genome-wide expectation, whereas markers with elevated amounts of introgression tend to be shifted on either side of the genome-wide expectation. The SNP markers with steep clines are hypothesized to be near genes involved in reproductive isolation and, as such, are possibly under selection in hybrids. According to theory (Barton 1983; Barton and Bengtsson 1986; Bierne et al. 2011) they tend to be coupled and form a barrier to gene flow. Conversely, SNP markers with shallow clines shifted away from the genome-wide expectation are likely near genes which actively cross the hybrid zone due to processes such as adaptive introgression. Such genomic regions have been reported from house mouse populations by Staubach et al. (2012) . When alleles move adaptively from one species to another one assumes it occurs in the same direction in different parts of the hybrid zone. This is suggested by the correlation of parameter values between transects. Some of the patterns observed here may also result from neutral ancestral polymorphism. However, our observation of a functional link with the amounts of introgression (see below) makes it unlikely to be simply a result of neutral processes.",

We found systematically higher differentiation in genomic regions of reduced introgression and, in some instances, lower differentiation in regions of extensive introgression. Also, the rate of recombination tends to be reduced for genomic regions of limited introgression and the opposite for genomic regions of extensive introgression. Our data are in accord with results by Geraldes et al. (2011) who found genomic regions of reduced recombination to have higher differentiation for 27 autosomal loci in the mouse genome. The same result was shown by Phifer-Rixey et al. (2014) for the testes transcriptome. When we compare our observations of varying genomic differentiation and rate of recombination with amounts of introgression in the context of current speciation theory, there are two ways to interpret our data according to the geographic context. In general, genomic regions of higher differentiation have been hypothesized to harbor genes involved in reproductive isolation (Turner et al. 2005; Harr 2006; Nosil et al. 2009) . Higher differentiation has been previously attributed to locally reduced gene flow due to reduced recombination and/or diversifying selection in sympatric and parapatric models of speciation (reviewed in Butlin 2005; Feder et al. 2012) . In the face of gene flow reduced recombination can prevent the break-up of coadapted genes involved in reproductive isolation (reviewed in Butlin 2005), leading to elevated genomic differentiation. A similar pattern of genomic differentiation by a different process, that is, the faster sorting of alleles due to selection at linked sites, can be observed in cases of allopatry (Noor and Bennett 2009; Nachman and Payseur 2012; Cruickshank and Hahn 2014) . In allopatry, the association between rate of recombination, genomic differentiation, and reproductive isolation may result from genetic conflict. This model suggests that incompatibilities involved in genetic conflict may preferentially accumulate in genomic regions of reduced recombination as the linkage between distorter and responder loci in these regions is less likely to break away (reviewed in Seehausen et al. 2014) . Given the observations by Duvaux et al. (2011) , gene flow between the two house mouse subspecies occurred long before the secondary contact in Central Europe. However, since divergence, the two subspecies have spent most of the time in allopatry, suggesting the majority of incompatibility loci accumulated during this period. Although a role for gene flow in the evolution of reproductive isolation in the house mouse has been suggested (see Vo slajerov a-B \u0131mov a et al. 2011), direct observations from the hybrid zone suggest that the main cause of hybrid inferiority is postzygotic isolation due to reduced fertility of hybrid males (Turner et al. 2011; Albrechtov a et al. 2012) . Regardless of the speciation model, our observations suggest rate of recombination and genomic differentiation are important players in species divergence.",

We also found that olfactory receptor genes were a prominent group of genes enriched in genomic regions of extensive introgression but depleted in genomic regions of reduced introgression. The functional polarization remained even after the removal of olfactory genes suggesting that cellular compartment (i.e., intracellular vs. cell periphery) is driving the pattern.

These genes may traverse species boundaries as a result of balancing selection (e.g., transpecific polymorphisms) or adaptive introgression (reviewed in Hedrick 2013). Olfactory receptor genes in the house mouse may represent a good example of these genes as they are known to be involved in chemical communication with the external environment and they often undergo rapid molecular evolution and extensive segmental duplications (Godfrey et al. 2004) .

It utilizes genomic cline models to describe patterns of introgression between two parental species at focal markers. The models describe the probability of ancestry of one parental species at a focal marker given the hybrid index with respect to a null model (see Gompert and Buerkle 2011 for details). The genomic cline model has two basic parameters-and . Following Gompert and Buerkle (2011) , the genomic cline parameter measures the change in probability of ancestry relative to a null expectation. For example, increasing (positive values) or decreasing (negative values) parameter values reflect shifts in genomic clines either to one of the two parental populations or vice versa. The genomic cline parameter reflects the rate of change in probability of ancestry from one parental population to the other. Positive values of the parameter denote an increase in the rate of change (steeper cline), whereas negative values denote a decrease in the rate of change (wider clines). For both parameters, a zero value corresponds to the null model. These two parameters dissect the pattern of introgression at a focal marker into two components which are not, however, fully independent. In our study, we use the parameter as a proxy for \"direction of introgression\" and the parameter as a proxy for \"amounts of introgression.\" Positive and negative parameter values represent directional movement of alleles into M. m. domesticus and M. m. musculus, respectively. The parameter reflects the strength of the barrier to gene flow between the two species. For positive values of , the higher the , the stronger the barrier. Negative values reflect the ability of alleles at a focal marker to escape the effect of the barrier, the greater the negative , the greater the ability to escape the barrier.",

The necessary scripts to extrapolate the genetic map used to estimate rate of recombination in sliding windows of a given size (1 and 10 Mb) were kindly provided by Gary Churchill, The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME. We used SA and sex-specific rates of recombination. We analyzed sex-specific rates of recombination due to known differences in the overall rate of recombination (Davisson et al. 1989) as well as in local variation in rate of recombination between the two sexes (Shifman et al. 2006; Cox et al. 2009) . To get an estimate of genomic differentiation between the two house mouse subspecies, we used publicly available genotypes of the Mouse Diversity Array (~500,000 SNPs; Yang et al. 2011) . From the array, we pulled out only European samples of the two house mouse subspecies (M. m. musculus, M. m. domesticus; supplementary table S2, Supplementary Material online). SNPs for the analysis were chosen by two criteria: 1) Those for which genotypes were available for all nineteen samples and 2) those that were polymorphic within these nineteen samples.

The method enables one to construct mixed-effect linear models which were used to take into account the hierarchical structure of genomic data. The SNP markers were nested within genomic regions which represented levels of random effect (i.e., chosen from a larger population of regions). When calculated over all three transects, individual transects were treated as random effects as well. The category for each SNP marker was treated as a fixed effect.

We assessed functional composition of genes for all three transects separately and also included genes within three window sizes (250, 500 kb, and 1 Mb) around the SNP markers. The genes were retrieved from the Ensembl Core database (Database Version 75; Flicek et al. 2014) . To characterize functional composition of these genes, we used the Gene Ontology (GO) term classification which was retrieved from the Gene Ontology MySQL server (downloaded March 24, 2014; Ashburner et al. 2000) . To reduce redundancy in functional terms, we used only GO terms at the second level of the GO hierarchy. The genes formed gene lists based on transect, window size and category (i.e., < 0, = 0, 4 0), and their functional composition was assessed for each list separately. In our analysis, we calculated functional profiles for each gene list in the manner of S anchez-Pla et al. (2007) . The functional profiles are composed of differences between expected and observed prevalence of genes within a gene list for each GO term separately. In order to use some statistically meaningful entity, we chose the negative decadic logarithm of P values (\u00c0log 10 (P)) based on a Fisher exact test of GO term enrichment/depletion. The appropriate sign (+/\u00c0) was further assigned according to whether the difference between expected and observed gene counts was negative or positive. The functional profile for each gene list thus represented a vector of modified P values and we worked with this set of functional profiles as multidimensional data. Each functional profile represented a response variable and the set of GO terms represented explanatory variables.",

For the clustering of functional profiles, we used agglomerative methods of which the Ward's minimum variance method based on the Euclidean distances between individual profiles provided the best results. However, we used other agglomerative methods including complete-linkage, averagelinkage, and single-linkage methods to test whether the results are robust enough with respect to the choice of method. The data were plotted using a \"heatmap\" function in R (a function included in the basic R release). The significance and robustness of the tree were based on 1,000 bootstraps and were obtained using the \"pvclust\" function implemented in the \"pvclust\" R package (Suzuki and Shimodaira 2006) . For the second approach, we used principal component analysis implemented as a \"PCA\" function in the \"FactoMineR\" R package (L\u00ea et al. 2008) .",
