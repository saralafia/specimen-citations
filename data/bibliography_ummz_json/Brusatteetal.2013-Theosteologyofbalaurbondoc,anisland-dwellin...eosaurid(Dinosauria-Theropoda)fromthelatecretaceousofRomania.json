The terrestrial vertebrates inhabiting these islands, especially the ''Ha\u0163eg Island,'' are among the most morphologically peculiar dinosaurs in the global fossil record. Dating back to the pioneering studies of Baron Franz Nopcsa, it has been widely recognized that many herbiv-orous dinosaurs from the Ha\u0163eg fauna were dwarfed, morphologically aberrant, and/or strikingly primitive relative to contemporaries from mainland continents (e.g., Nopcsa, 1914; Weishampel et al., 1991; Benton et al., 2010; Weishampel and Jianu, 2011) . These fossils are often touted as a prime example of the ''island effect'': the evolutionary phenomenon where island-dwelling species are often smaller and anatomically distinct compared to close mainland relatives (e.g., Foster, 1964; Van Valen, 1973; Lomolino, 1985 Lomolino, , 2005 Lomolino et al., 2006; Benton et al., 2010) .",

These specimens have formed the basis for almost all previous discussion of the ''island effect'' in dinosaur faunas. In contrast, very little is known about the carnivorous dinosaurs that inhabited Ha\u0163eg Island, or any other Mesozoic islands, as their fossils are mostly restricted to isolated teeth and other fragmentary remains (Weishampel et al., 2004) . It has long been unclear whether island-dwelling predatory dinosaurs were also dwarfed, aberrant, or primitive, or whether the ''island effect'' had little influence on these animals. The recent discovery of a substantially complete skeleton of a Late Cretaceous Romanian theropod, Balaur bondoc, provides the first clear glimpse at an island-dwelling carnivorous dinosaur. This specimen was briefly described in a short paper by Csiki et al. (2010a) , who showed that it represented a dromaeosaurid theropod, closely related to Velociraptor, which was morphologically aberrant but not primitive and apparently not dwarfed ( fig. 1 ).",

We update the diagnosis of Balaur based on new preparation of the holotype and comparisons with other dromaeosaurids, and use histological techniques to assess the age and growth stage of both the holotype and putative referred specimens of Balaur from another locality in Romania. We also present an updated appraisal of the phylogenetic relationships of Balaur based on the comprehensive new coelurosaurian cladistic dataset of Turner et al. (2012) . Finally, we review the fossil record of European Late Cretaceous theropods, discuss the biogeographic history of European terminal Cretaceous dinosaur faunas, and comment on the extreme morphological specializations of Balaur, which were likely due to the island effect.",

Fragmentary skeleton found partly articulated and belonging to a single individual, including: 8 dorsal vertebrae (7 in articulated series); rib fragments; sacrum and associated caudosacral vertebrae; 4 proximal-middle caudal vertebrae; both left and right scapulocoracoids, humeri, ulnae, and radii; complete right carpometacarpus as well as left metacarpals I and II; complete right manus and complete digits I and II of left manus; articulated pelvis with acetabular region of both ilia together with fragmentary left and right pubes and ischia; left tibiotarsus and fibula, tarsometatarsus, and complete foot in articulation; and almost complete right tarsometatarsus. Associated sternal plates were observed and mapped in the field, but were recovered in a fragmentary state. Neurocentral sutures are closed in all dorsal and caudal vertebrae, suggesting that the holotype individual was mature or nearing skeletal maturity. This is corroborated by histological evidence: the presence of dense Haversian bone and substantially diminished spacing between lines of arrested growth (LAGs) near the periosteal surface suggests that this individual was somatically mature (see below for full explanation of histology), and no less than seven years of age (based on LAGs). A skeletal reconstruction of the holotype is presented M.V. (September 2009) from red floodplain mudstones of the lower-middle part of the Late Cretaceous (late early Maastrichtian) Sebe\u015f Formation, exposed at the Sebe\u015f-Glod locality (figs. 2-3). The Sebe\u015f-Glod locality (abbreviated as SbG/A-D) encapsulates a suite of restricted outcrops located 1.5 to 3.0 km north of Sebe\u015f city (SW Transylvanian Basin, Alba county, Romania), downstream along the Sebe\u015f River ( fig. 2 ) (Codrea et al., 2010; Csiki et al., 2010a) . These outcrops expose a roughly 50 m thick profile from the mid-lower section of the Sebe\u015f Formation (SBF), 300 to 350 m below the major middle-Miocene (Badenian) unconformity that caps the Sebe\u015f Formation at its type section (R\u00e2 pa Ro\u015fie/Red Cliff), and approximately 100 m above the top of the conformably underlying marine Boze\u015f Formation (late Santonian-lowermost Maastrichtian), which is well exposed at the nearby Petre\u015fti-Arini (PT) section (Vremir, 2010) . The Sebe\u015f Formation succession is dominated by coarse, mainly cross-bedded channel fills (gravels, sandy gravels, cross-laminated sandstones) with occasional interbeds of finer grained red or brownish-red overbank and floodplain associations (fine laminated sandstones, silty claystones, massive mudstones), all of which was formed by a high-sinuosity fluvial system. The SbG/B site is a small waterlogged riverbed outcrop, exhibiting a 6 m thick profile that dips slightly eastward (figs. 2, 4). The basal channel association is built up by fining upward, medium-to-coarse, occasionally pebbly, light pinkish-gray sandstones, grouped in progressively thinner trough cross-laminated sets (dunes) that show internal truncation (St/Sp), characterizing a lateral accretional facies (LA).

Many preserved bones suffered long-term subaerial biodegradation, disarticulation, effects of sca-venging (possibly from crocodylomorphs), and prefossilization weathering (weathering stage 3-5), including occasional insect-related surficial modifications. Most insect marks may be assigned to coleopterans (Dermestidae?) and isopterans (termites), pointing to long-term subaerial exposure of bones, a low water table, a sparsely vegetated environment, and relatively dry conditions. Episodic flood-related fine sediment input then covered the drifted and partially degraded carcasses. As indicated by the bone map ( fig. 4B ), the partially decayed Balaur carcass (probably still bearing some soft tissues) was probably transported in a low-energy current during a waning flood, then subaerially exposed (weathering stage 1-2), partially disarticulated, and finally buried due to additional sediment input. As suggested by the quarry map, lithological profile, and sedimentological analysis, more extensive excavations at the site may lead to the recovery of some remaining bones of the Balaur holotype, particularly hind-limb elements, or eventually the neck region and skull. The distal caudal series, however, was destroyed and washed away by recent fluvial erosion.",

Two pelvic characters that Csiki et al. (2010a) originally considered as autapomorphies of B. bondoc-a laterally everted pubic peduncle and the reorientation of the lateral surface of the pubis to face ventrally-are here reinterpreted as artifacts of crushing. Reexamination and additional preparation of the holotype pelvis indicates that the specimen has been subjected to extensive dorsoventral crushing, which has caused the ilium to break along the margins of the cuppedicus fossa (making it seem as if the pubic peduncle is laterally everted) and the pubis to artificially rotate ventrally. This crushing, which is described in further detail below, fully explains the presence of the two supposed autapomorphies, which we no longer consider valid. Furthermore, a third autapomorphy listed by Csiki et al. (2010a) , extremely retroverted pubes and ischia whose long axes are nearly horizontal, is here considered only potentially valid because it may also be explained partially, or entirely, by crushing. The Tu\u015ftea (also referred to as Oltoane Hill) nesting site, north of the Tu\u015ftea locality, Ha\u0163eg Basin, Hunedoara County, Romania. The nesting site is located in a 1 m thick, red silty mudstone bed overlying a thin, mediumgrained crevasse splay sandstone, and covered by a thick, poorly sorted conglomeratesandstone unit locally showing tabular or trough cross-bedding, as well as graded bed-ding. According to the local stratigraphic framework, the nesting site is placed in the unnamed middle subunit (member) of the Densu\u015f-Ciula Formation, a continental detritic-volcanoclastic unit of Maastrichtian age (Bojar et al., 2011) ; more detailed information on the sedimentology and paleoenvironmental setting of the Tu\u015ftea site is given by Bojar et al. (2005) , Grigorescu et al. (1994 Grigorescu et al. ( , 2010 , and Therrien (2005) .",

Although most of these fossils are found disarticulated, several instances of associated (even articulated) remains have also been recorded (e.g., Csiki et al., 2010b . All of the Balaur referred material was discovered during the same excavation season (1997) , and all the bones were spread across a small area roughly along the same stratigraphic level within the fossiliferous bed. No futher postcranial remains referrable to Balaur or close relatives were subsequently discovered at the Tu\u015ftea site, despite continuous excavations. Moreover, all referred Balaur material belongs to the forelimb, all elements are commensurate in size, and all show the same peculiar surface texture, a characteristic feature of Balaur (see below).

First, all bones of the referred specimens possess the characteristic rugose surface texture of the Balaur holotype (this is also present in other isolated theropod bones from Romania). Second, the humerus exhibits a sinuous ridge on the lateral surface of the distal end, which extends for approximately 1/3 of the length of the bone, as well as a prominent ridge on medial surface of distal half. Third, the ulna possesses a flat anterior surface that is bisected by a longitudinal ridge. Fourth, metacarpal II possesses a distal ridge that laterally overhangs metacarpal III, as well as a distal articular surface that does not extend onto the plantar surface (the latter an autapomorphy of Balaur among dromaeosaurids but not among all theropods). Therefore, these specimens can be united with the holotype of B. bondoc based on synapomorphies, and for this reason, Csiki et al. (2010a) considered them to represent a referred specimen of B. bondoc. Although these specimens share unique derived characters with the B. bondoc holo-type, Csiki et al. (2010a) noted a peculiar fact: the referred material is substantially larger than the holotype. The referred humerus is 1.45 times the length of the holotype humerus, whereas the referred ulna is 1.65 times larger. Csiki et al. (2010a) suspected that the holotype of B. bondoc was a mature individual, because of extensive fusion across the skeleton, but were unable to provide a histological estimate of absolute age and growth stage because of extensive fungal damage to the interior regions of the long bones commonly used for these estimates. As part of this monograph we attempted to take further histological samples and were able to obtain samples from the holotype fibula and referred ulna. As detailed below, these Measurements of appendicular bones (in mm) of additional referred specimens of Balaur sp.",

It seems unusual that two mature and slow-growing adults of the same species would vary in size to the degree noted between the two specimens of Balaur. It is difficult to test whether this may be the case in other dinosaur species, because sample sizes are usually too low to permit histological examination of large numbers of individuals. Sander and Klein (2005) did find that fully grown individuals of the basal sauropodomorph Plateosaurus may differ in size by up to 50%, but it is worth noting that this determination is based on specimens from a single locality (not multiple localities like the two specimens of Balaur) and hinges on a single outlier specimen that is much larger than a tight cluster of several similarly sized mature individuals (Sander and Klein, 2005: fig. 3B ). Furthermore, Plateosaurus is distantly related to dromaeosaurids, is hypothesized to have had a less active metabolism than the birdlike dromaeosaurids, and its great variability in adult body size is hypothesized to have been related to local environmental conditions (Sander and Klein, 2005) . In summary, it is not clear whether the case study of Plateosaurus growth and variability is applicable to dromaeosaurids in general or the case of the two Balaur specimens in particular.",

We emphasize, however, that this removal is based on a biological argument (the improbability of a biological species varying in adult size to this degree) and not an anatomical argument (a lack of synapomorphies). Indeed, the two specimens share several unique derived characters and are therefore hypothesized to be close relatives, and surely sister taxa among all currently known theropods. Because these shared characters are autapomorphies of Balaur, we now assign the referred material to Balaur sp., with the prediction that it belongs to a larger species closely related to B. bondoc. Therefore, the size differences between the holotype and referred specimen should not be used as evidence that a single dinosaur species can vary greatly in adult body size or continue growing after extensively fusing its skeleton . Fowler et al. (2011) recently used Balaur as an example of the latter phenomenon, and thus as support for their hypothesis that some tyrannosaurids may also undergo dramatic size changes after fusing portions of their skeleton. We strongly caution against this line of argument.",

Such marked dimorphism cannot be ruled out for Balaur, and it is hoped that this possibility can be tested as more specimens become available.

This is the infraprezygapophyseal fossa (5 hapidocoel of Ostrom, 1969) , which is a broader fossa in more anterior dorsals (e.g., dorsal C), but takes the form of a deep notch here because it occupies less space due to the dorsal migration of the parapophysis.

The size, shape, and position of the foramina are highly variable along the column and between the left and right sides of a single vertebra (dorsal F, the only vertebra exposed on both lateral sides). The left foramen of dorsal F is ovoid, much deeper, and larger (3.5 mm anteroposteriorly by 3 mm dorsoventrally) than the more circular right foramen (1.5 mm by 2 mm). Furthermore, the foramen on dorsal C is large and deep (3 mm anteriorposteriorly by 2 mm dorsoventrally), whereas that on dorsal D is a tiny circle (diameter of 0.75 mm), and some foramina are positioned immediately below the neurocentral suture (e.g., dorsals C, D) whereas others are positioned further ventrally (e.g., dorsal F). Pneumatic features are also present on the neural arch. Above the lamina linking the postzygapophysis and transverse process of dorsal G is a collapsed region that exposes large internal chambers, which would have been covered laterally in life ( fig. 7 , denoted by arrows). Other broken surfaces, especially on dorsals C, D, and H, also reveal extensive hollow internal cavities.

The lateral depressions are not present on more posterior sacral vertebrae, so if the sacrum is pneumatic then there is little external evidence of this morphology.

Its anterior surface, which is well visible on the left side in anterior view, is smooth and concave; the concavity appears to be very deep, but this may be exaggerated by crushing. The third rib contacts the ilium immediately anterior to the level of the acetabulum and expands in anteroposterior length as it continues laterally to meet the ilium. The fourth rib is preserved on both sides and extends laterally, without twisting. It is clearly shallower dorsoventrally than the third rib, and hence is not as greatly expanded where it meets the ilium. The fourth rib is the longest of the sacral series in the mediolateral dimension, and as a result the sacral vertebrae and ilium are widely separated in this region, as in Velociraptor (Norell and Makovicky, 1999: fig. 17 ) and Microraptor zhaoianus (Hwang et al., 2002) . In dorsal and ventral views there are large, ovoid fenestrae between the sacral ribs; these openings are bounded medially by the sacral vertebrae and laterally by the ilium.",

Furthermore, there is an unfused single vertebra between the fused sacrum-plus-caudosacral block and the first caudal vertebra. We also refer to this as a caudosacral vertebra, based on comparison to Velociraptor, in which the first caudal is located between the postacetabular blades of the ilium and becomes incorporated into the sacrum late in ontogeny (Norell and Makovicky, 1999) .

These latter two vertebrae are identified as anterior caudals because they retain transverse processes, which disappear posterior to caudal 11 in Deinonychus (Ostrom, 1969) and Velociraptor (Norell and Makovicky, 1997, 1999) . In comparison with Deinonychus (Ostrom, 1969) , caudal E of Balaur appears to be approximately equivalent to caudal 8-9, due to the fact that the transverse process is reduced to a thin longitudinal ridge and the neural spine to a sharp, anteroposteriorly short ridge that also appears to have been dorsoventrally short in life. The caudal centra lengthen posteriorly and their anterior and posterior articular faces, where well preserved, are concave. The ventral surfaces of caudals 3, D, and E are excavated by a longitudinal groove that is deepest at its center and shallows anteriorly and posteriorly before abruptly terminating at the articular face. Unfortunately, the ventral surfaces of caudals 1 and 2 are embedded in matrix and are not visible. The lateral surfaces of the caudal vertebrae are smoothly and slightly depressed, but there are no pneumatic foramina or other features of obvious pneumatic origin. The centrum and neural arch are coossified in all specimens and their suture has been obliterated.",

The postzygapophysis is well preserved on the right side of caudal D. It is shorter than the prezygapophysis and extends only slightly posterior to the posterior articular face.

There is a sharp lamina, preserved only on small regions of caudals D and E, that extends from the prezygapophysis to the postzygapophysis along the lateral surface of the vertebra.

This feature is characteristic of paravians, including other dromaeosaurids and avialans (e.g., Turner et al., 2007a Turner et al., , 2012 , and allows increased humeral abduction, a necessary component of the avian flight stroke (Gauthier and Padian, 1985) .

As in paravians generally, the coracoid is L-shaped, due to a discrete ventral process that is inflected medially to articulate with the anterior margin of the sternum (e.g., Norell and Makovicky, 1999; Hwang et al., 2002; Turner et al., 2007a Turner et al., , 2012 . The ventral process is large and robust, and measures 28 mm long as preserved on the more complete left coracoid, but its anterior edge is broken and it would have been larger in life (figs. 10-11: cvp). Anteroventral to the glenoid, on the posterolaterally facing surface of the ventral process, is a shallow subglenoid fossa (figs. 10-11: sgf). This triangular fossa is present in other paravians, as well as some ornithomimosaurs (e.g., Norell and Makovicky, 1999; Turner et al., 2007a Turner et al., , 2012 . Compared to the morphology of other dromaeosaurids the subglenoid fossa of Balaur appears to be shallowly inset, but this may be an artifact of poor preservation. The fossa of Tsaagan is also described as shallow, however, so there may be phylogenetically informative variation in the depth of the fossa among dromaeosaurids (Norell et al., 2006) .",

The lateral surface of the blade is flat or shallowly convex across most of its length, but becomes more strongly convex anteriorly as the scapula curves medially ventral to the acromion to articulate with the coracoid. The medial surface, on the other hand, is flat anteriorly and becomes convex posteriorly, and there is no medial ridge as present in many theropods (e.g., Brochu, 2003) . The acromion is broken dorsally, but the entire preserved portion has a smoothly concave lateral surface, as is characteristic of dromaeosaurids such as Velociraptor (Norell and Makovicky, 1999) (fig. 10: ac) . Furthermore, the acromion is clearly everted, such that it projects anteromedially relative to the parasagittal long axis of the scapular blade, which is readily apparent in dorsal view. As a result, the lateral surface of the acromion faces not only laterally but also anteriorly as well. Such eversion is a characteristic feature of paravians and is present in other dromaeosaurids (e.g., Ostrom, 1969; Norell and Makovicky, 1999; Burnham et al., 2000; Hwang et al., 2002; Norell et al., 2006) , troodontids (e.g., Xu et al., 2002) , and avialans (Clarke and Norell, 2002; Zhang, 2002, 2003; Clarke et al., 2006) .

The humeral head is missing on the right humerus and only half remains on the left, but it is clear that it is bulbous and strongly overhangs the posterior, but not the anterior, surface of the humerus ( fig. 12 : hh). This is also the case in other dromaeosaurids such as Bambiraptor (Burnham, 2004) , Deinonychus (Ostrom, 1969) , and Velociraptor (IGM 100/985). Medial to the head, and separated from it by a groove on the posterior surface, is an enlarged internal tuberosity ( fig. 12 : it). The elongate morphology of the internal tuberosity is characateristic of dromaeosaurids (e.g., Ostrom, 1969; Novas and Puerta, 1997; Burnham et al., 2000; Calvo et al., 2004; Makovicky et al., 2005) and is also present in other coelurosaurs (e.g., Choiniere et al., 2010) . The enlarged nature of the tuberosity is readily apparent in medial view, in which the internal tuberosity appears as a convex, bulbous structure that is expanded anteriorly and posteriorly. Lateral to the head there is a small tuberosity on the proximal surface, which projects proximally as a discrete, conical structure, but is not expanded anteriorly or posteriorly (fig. 12: et) . This tuber likely corresponds to the external tuberosity, but comparison with other dromaeosaurids is difficult due to poor preservation in most taxa.",

The crest extends straight anteriorly, such that in proximal view it is approximately perpendicular to the long axis of the proximal surface of the humerus ( fig. 12 : dpc). This is also the case in most other dromaeosaurids, but the deltopectoral crests of the unenlagiines Austroraptor (Novas et al., 2009) , Buitreraptor (Makovicky et al., 2005) , and Unenlagia (Calvo et al., 2004) project anteriorly and laterally, and hence form an obtuse angle relative to the proximal surface. Proximally the crest is thin and sheetlike, with a mediolateral width of 2 mm, but distally it thickens and expands in width to 5 mm. The humeral shaft immediately distal to the deltopectoral crest is marked by a sinuous crest following the edge where the posterior and lateral surfaces meet ( fig. 12 : slc). This crest parallels the lateral margin of the bone for 22 mm. Medial to the crest, on the posterior surface of the humerus, is a deep and elongate groove. A nearly identical crest and groove are present in Bambiraptor (Burnham et al., 2000) , Deinonychus (Ostrom, 1969), Linheraptor (Xu et al., 2010) , and Velociraptor (Norell and Makovicky, 1999) , and likely represents a derived character shared by these taxa. A ridge is also present in Buitreraptor (MPCA 245) and Unenlagia (Calvo et al., 2004) , but it is located more proximally, such that it follows the trend of the deltopectoral crest itself, and does not demarcate a groove (Calvo et al., 2004 : figs. 9-10).",

The fossa, which extends approximately 25% of the proximodistal length of the humerus, is bordered laterally and medially by pronounced crests, which originate from the proximal tips of the ectepicondyle and entepicondyle, respectively (fig. 12: ec, en). The medial ridge is oriented straight proximodistally, extends to the midpoint of the humeral shaft, and gradually becomes sharper and more prominent as it continues proximally (fig. 12: mrid). At its most proximal position, before abruptly merging with the shaft, the ridge forms a sheetlike shelf that overhangs the medial surface. The lateral crest is oriented obliquely, proximomediallydistolaterally, and is shorter than the medial crest. Where it terminates proximally it merges with a third ridge, which extends straight proximodistally to bisect the fossa ( fig. 12 : brid). This ridge does not separate the fossa into two equal partitions, but is located closer to the medial margin and terminates distally at the proximal tip of the ulnar condyle. A deep fossa, demarcated by lateral and medial ridges, is present in other dromaeosaurids and troodontids (e.g., Ostrom, 1969; Burnham et al., 2000; Currie and Dong, 2001; Calvo et al., 2004) . However, the prominent, shelflike morphology and extreme proximal extent of the medial ridge are autapomorphic for Balaur.",

However, portions of the radial (lateral) condyle are present, and these poorly preserved regions indicate that this structure was located on the anterior surface of the humerus ( fig. 12 : rc). This is unique among dromaeosaurids, which otherwise have the normal theropod condition of a distally placed radial condyle, but is also seen in therizinosauroids and often is considered a diagnostic feature of that clade (e.g., Zanno, 2006) . The ectepicondyle is mostly eroded on both humeri, but is clearly present as a discrete structure, separated from the radial condyle ( fig. 12 : ec). The entepicondyle is preserved on the right humerus and takes the form of a robust ridge that is oriented proximodistally and extends for a total length of 10 mm (fig. 12: en). It is separated from the base of the ulnar condyle by a groove on the anterior surface of the humerus; although the ulnar condyle is missing, the groove itself is well preserved. A subtle fossa is present immediately medial to the entepicondyle, but it does not extend further proximally than the entepicondyle itself. In general, the morphology of the distal humerus is extremely similar to Deinonychus in overall morphology (Ostrom, 1969) .",

Beginning near the distal termination of the humerus is a thin, sharp, sinuous ridge that continues proxi-mally for 1/3 of the length of the bone ( fig. 12 : lrid). This ridge is not present in Bambiraptor (Burnham et al., 2000) , Buitreraptor (Makovicky et al., 2005) , Deinonychus (Ostrom, 1969) , Unenlagia (Calvo et al., 2005) , or Velociraptor (IGM 100/985), and is therefore an autapomorphy of Balaur. A ridge is present on the lateral surface of the distal end in Bambiraptor, but this is simply the ridge defining the lateral margin of the anterior fossa, as described above, which is somewhat reoriented relative to other dromaeosaurids such that it is also visible in lateral view (Burnham et al., 2000: fig. 3 Additionally, it has a radial condyle located on the anterior surface of the distal end, which is also present in the holotype but otherwise unknown among dromaeosaurids (fig. 13: rc). Finally, it possesses dromaeosaurid features such as the groove distal to the deltopectoral crest and the deep fossa on the anterior surface of the distal end. Although this bone can be referred to Balaur it does exhibit some differences compared to the much smaller holotype humeri. For instance, on the posterior surface of the proximal end there is a distinct oblique crest that rises to the base of the head, which is absent in the holotype. Furthermore, on the anterior surface of the proximal end there is a ridge bisecting the deep fossa, whereas there is no median ridge in the holotype. Finally, the detailed morphology of the fossa differs between the two specimens: the entire fossa is excavated as a smooth concavity in the holotype, but in the referred specimen the region between the novel bisecting ridge and the medial ridge is convex.",

The coronoid process is continuous with a long, sharp crest that extends for 32 mm proximodistally and is only 2 mm thick anteroposteriorly at its midpoint (fig. 14: cpr). It is bordered both anteriorly and posteriorly by shallow fossae that parallel the crest across its entire length. A similar morphology is present in Deinonychus (Ostrom, 1969), but is difficult to assess in other dromaeosaurids because many specimens lack ulnae or because the ulna is often preserved flattened on slab specimens (especially in the Chinese Jehol material). The olecranon process of Balaur is mostly eroded (fig. 14: oc), but was clearly large, distinct, and conical, as in other dromaeosaurids (e.g., Ostrom, 1969; Forster et al., 1998; Norell and Makovicky, 1999; Hwang et al., 2002; Turner et al., 2007a) .",

Furthermore, the lateral and medial margins of the bone, where the flat anterior surface meets the more convex lateral and medial surfaces, are defined as sharp ridges due to the abrupt change of surface orientation. The flat anterior surface is bisected by an elongate, sharp ridge that is oriented proximodistally (fig. 14: arid). The ridge begins proximally at the level of the distal termination of the coronoid process and extends distally before terminating against an eroded surface 31 mm from the distal end of the bone. However, based on the morphology of the referred ulna (see below), it is likely that the ridge continued to the distal end of the bone. The flat anterior surface and bisecting ridge together comprise an autapomorphy of Balaur, as the anterior ulna is more convex and lacks a sharp, elongate ridge in other dromaeosaurids (e.g., Ostrom, 1969; Burnham, 2004) . Unfortunately, surface preservation is not fine enough to assess the presence or absence of quill knobs for the attachment of secondary flight feathers, as are present in extant avialans and have been identified in the dromaeosaurids Rahonavis (Forster et al., 1998) and Velociraptor (Turner et al., 2007b) . It is clear, however, that there was no pronounced bicipital tuberosity on the anterior surface of the proximal end of the shaft.",

The number of fused carpals is difficult to determine due to the extreme fusion of the carpometacarpus, which has obliterated sutures between individual bones. Similarly, the morphology of the carpals cannot be described in detail. The metacarpals themselves are fused proximally but diverge from each other distally, and much of their morphology is visible. Despite the heavy fusion, the first two metacarpals of Balaur are similar to those of other dromaeosaurids and show no affinity with the stocky metacarpals of alvarezsauroids (Perle et al., 1994; Choiniere et al., 2010) or the avialan condition in which metacarpals II and III are fused proximally and distally and metacarpal I is reduced to a nubbin. In the Balaur holotype, the right carpometacarpus is essentially complete (figs. 17-18), whereas only fragments of the left metacarpals I and II are present, broken and separated from each other ( fig. 19 ).",

Posteriorly the distal surface divides into two condyles. The medial condyle is an elongate oval, with a long axis oriented ventromedially, which tapers posteriorly to a rounded point. The lateral condyle is smaller, more strongly convex distally, and has a long axis that is oriented closer to straight dorsoventrally (extensor-flexor direction). The condyles continue onto the flexor (ventral) surface and are separated by a deep flexor groove ( fig. 18 : fg), which excavates both the distal and flexor surfaces of the articular region. However, separate condyles do not extend onto the extensor (dorsal) surface, and in extensor view the distal margin appears as a slightly convex, continuously rounded margin. This is an autapomorphy among dromaeosaurids, and is associated with more limited manual extension relative to closely related taxa. In contrast, dromaeosaurids such as Deinonychus (Ostrom, 1969) , Graciliraptor (Xu and Wang, 2004) , and Velociraptor (Norell and Makovicky, 1999;  IGM 100/982) possess a metacarpal I with distal condyles that extend onto the extensor surface, and are clearly apparent in extensor view as discrete structures separated by a concave margin.

Therefore, limited manual extension was possible. The flexor surface of the bone is concave proximally as a triangular fossa, then convex at midlength, and finally becomes concave again distally at the flexor groove.

Further distally it curves ventrally (i.e., toward the flexor direction), and in doing so defines a flat, triangular facet dorsal to it (i.e., toward the extensor direc-tion). This facet articulates against the distal end of metacarpal III. Between their proximal fused contact and distal unfused articulation ( fig. 18 : ucII-III), the two metacarpals parallel each other and are separated by approximately 2 mm. The web on metacarpal II is most pronounced at approximately one third of the length of the shaft, where it is visible in extensor view as a rugose crest that projects laterally, and in lateral view as a thickened ridge that is dorsally convex (toward the extensor direction).

On the flexor surface, the proximal fused region is projected below the remainder of the metacarpus and extends to approximately the same level as the lateral edge of metacarpal I. Together, these two ventrally projected regions define a deep depression between them, which covers the entirety of the flexor surface of the proximal portion of metacarpal II and much of the flexor surfaces of the proximal regions of metacarpals I and III. Distally, the articular surface of metacarpal III is a single, rounded structure that is not divided into separate condyles. This is an unusual condition, departing from the double condyles present in other dromaeosaurids (e.g., Ostrom, 1969; Norell and Makovicky, 1999; Burnham, 2004; Xu and Wang, 2004) , and is related to the atrophied morphology of the phalanges of the third digit (see below PV.313 ). These include: the restriction of the intercondylar groove to the flexor surface of the distal end, so that the distal articular end is straight in extensor view; the widely divergent distal condyles on the flexor surface; and, especial-ly, the unique raised web that would have overhung metacarpal III distally. As this referred specimen is disarticulated from the remainder of the (presumably) fused carpometacarpus, it also reveals some details of the lateral and medial surfaces that are hidden in the holotype by the closely appressed metacarpals I and III.",

On the medial surface, a short, flat, triangular area faces ventromedially along the proximal region of the bone; it is bordered ventrally (in the flexor direction) by an oblique and subtly pronounced ridge ending at approximately the same level as the ridge that bisects the portion of the flexor surface that is exposed laterally (see above). The subtle ridge on the medial surface begins in a ventral position proximally and extends toward the midline of the medial surface as it continues distally, before eventually terminating in a small protuberance. Based on comparisons with the holotype metacarpus, the flat triangular facet on the medial surface is an articulation site for metacarpal I. Due to the ventromedial orientation of this articular surface, the line of contact between the two metacarpals would have been more laterally displaced on the flexor surface, as metacarpal II has a wider exposure in extensor view than in flexor view; this condition is also seen in the articulated carpometacarpus of the holotype of B. bondoc.

In general, the lateral ligament pits are deeper and larger than the medial pits on all phalanges, and deep flexor grooves and the great extent of the distal condyles onto the flexor surface of the phalanges is indicative of substantial manual flexion abilities. On the contrary, the lack of deep extensor pits and the absence of any migration of the distal articular surface onto the extensor surface of the phalanges suggest that manual extension was limited relative to that of other dromaeosaurids (e.g., Ostrom, 1969; Norell and Makovicky, 1999 21-22 , A-F). The saddle is asymmetrical to match the condyles of the metacarpal: the lateral portion is deeper to accept the more convex lateral condyle of metacarpal I, and the two lateral and medial portions are oriented obliquely to each other. The long axis of the proximal surface is dorsomedially oriented, such that it appears twisted relative to the long axis of the phalanx itself. There are no flexor or extensor tubercles on the proximal surface, but there is a pronounced lip surrounding the entire proximal region, which is especially prominent ventrally (in the flexor direction). The flexor surface of phalanx I-1 is concave, defined laterally and medially by longitudinal ridges on the edges of the shaft. The concavity is most pronounced proximally and distally adjacent to the articular ends. The extensor surface of the phalanx is convex and the lateral and medial surfaces are subtly convex but nearly flat. Distally there are ligament pits on both sides, unlike metacarpal I, which possesses only a lateral pit. The pits are extensively visible in extensor view because the distal end is expanded relative to the shaft.",

The flexor tubercle is smaller than that of the first ungual, and the presence or absence of the ventral foramina cannot be assessed due to breakage and poor preservation. One notable difference with the first ungual is that the lateral and medial grooves are Yshaped, as the single groove that is present across most of the length of the bone bifurcates proximally into two short grooves that are oriented obliquely to each other ( fig. 23: ygr) . This feature is not present in Deinonychus (Ostrom, 1969) or Velociraptor (IGM 100/982; Norell and Makovicky, 1999) , which possess a standard single groove on each surface, and is therefore an autapomorphy of Balaur fig. 26A-E) . The ventral lip delimiting the proximal articular surface is well developed and extends slightly more proximally on the left side; a similar asymmetry is also evident on the dorsal lip. In flexor view, the phalanx is transversely concave between the raised lateral and medial margins. The concavity is especially deep proximally and distally. Far proximally, underneath the ventral lip of the articular surface, the concavity grades into a nearly flat platform. This platform is bounded laterally and medially by small, moundlike prominences, which are the proximal terminations of the raised lateral and medial edges of the flexor surface. Immediately above the medial prominence there is a smooth, teardrop-shaped pit that excavates the medial surface of the phalanx. The medial surface is marked by an angular ridge along its midline; this ridge begins dorsal to the teardropshaped pit (i.e., further in the extensor direction) and extends longitudinally to approximately the midpoint of the shaft, where it is most prominent. The extensor surface is marked by another angular longitudinal ridge that begins at the halfway point of the dorsal lip of the proximal articular surface and flattens as it extends distally to a point slightly beyond the middle of the bone. The more proximally extended and thickened dorsolateral corner of the dorsal lip gives the proximal end of the bone a markedly asymmetrical shape, and also makes it appear as if the proximal region is offset laterally from the longitudinal midline of the shaft. Distally, despite poor preservation, it is apparent that similarly sized distal condyles are divided by a flexor groove that appears to extend onto the distal articular surface, identical to the condition in the holotype phalanx I-1 of B. bondoc.",

                "text": "PELVIC CRUSHING: The block containing the holotype pelvis and sacrum of Balaur is dorsoventrally crushed ( fig. 27 ). Additional preparation after the original description of the specimen (Csiki et al., 2010a) , along with detailed reexamination undertaken as part of this monograph project, reveals that this crushing is more extensive than originally appreciated. On both sides, crushing has cracked the pelvis along the dorsal and posterior bounding ridges of the cuppedicus fossa on the pubic peduncle (these pronounced ridges seem to have acted as local strong points). The deformation appears to be stronger on the left side, however, as there are several noticeable breaks on the left ilium and pubis, and because the left sacral rib is noticeably displaced ventrally relative to the right sacral rib (both ribs are in articulation with the ilium). This extreme deformation explains two supposed autapomorphies described by Csiki et al. (2010a) , which we here consider invalid. First, the cuppedicus fossa, which would have faced laterally in life, now faces almost entirely ventrally because of the crushing. The crushing is so extensive that Csiki et al. (2010a) mistook the broken dorsal bounding ridge of the cuppedicus fossa (which in life Fig. 27 . Pelvis and sacrum of Balaur bondoc (EME PV.313) in left lateral (A) and right lateral (B) views. Photographs taken before final preparation. Abbreviations: acet, acetabulum, anti, antitrochanter; cf, cuppedicus fossa; dcfr, ridge demarcating dorsal edge of cuppedicus fossa; df, dorsal flange of proximal ischium; ic, ischial crest; it, ischial tubercle; obrid, oblique ridge extending anterodorsally from the antitrochanter; p, pubis; pa, pubic apron; pcfr, ridge demarcating posterior edge of cuppedicus fossa; pospr, postacetabular process of ilium; prepr, preacetabular process of ilium; s1, first sacral vertebra; sac, supraacetabular crest.

Abbreviations: acet, acetabulum; arid, anterior ridge on dorsal surface of pubic shaft; mdrid, medial ridge on dorsal surface of pubis that contributes to pubic apron; mvrid, medial ridge on ventral surface of pubis that contributes to pubic apron; pa, pubic apron; prepr, preacetabular process; prid, posterior ridge on dorsal surface of pubic shaft. Scale bar equals 1 cm. also defines the ventral margin of the iliac preacetabular process; fig. 27 : dcfr) to be the ventral margin of the pubic peduncle. As a result, they misidentified the preacetabular process as the pubic peduncle, and the fossa covering it as the cuppedicus fossa, and regarded the laterally projecting nature of this part of the ilium to be autapomorphic. Indeed, a laterally (instead of ventrally) projecting pubic peduncle would be unusual, but the ventral portion of the preacetabular process does project laterally as a sheetlike flange in other dromaeosaurids (e.g., Velociraptor: IGM 100/986). Therefore, the condition in Balaur is similar to that in close relatives and is not autapomorphic. Csiki et al. (2010a) interpreted the supposed autapomorphy of Balaur as an attachment site for increased femoral extensor musculature, but our reinterpretation confirms that there was nothing unusual about the size or position of this muscle attachment site (at least compared to closely related dromaeosaurids such as Velociraptor and Adasaurus).",

The break appears to occur slightly proximal to where the pubic peduncle of the ilium and the pubis are fused together. After the pubis was detached, it then rotated somewhat ventrally, such that its lateral surface now faces primarily ventrally. Csiki et al. (2010a) considered this to be a genuine feature of the anatomy, and hence an autapomorphy, but we here reinterpret it as an artifact of crushing, due to the obvious break in the pubis on the left side and the more traditional orientation of the pubis (lateral surface facing more strongly laterally) on the right side.",

The left ilium is 75 mm long anteroposteriorly as preserved, but would have been much longer in life because it is broken both anteriorly and posteriorly (table 2) . The preserved regions are enough to indicate that the two ilia did not approach each other and make contact with the sacral neural spine apron, but rather diverged from each other laterally, as is the case in all dromaeosaurids (Norell and Makovicky, 1997; Turner et al., 2007a) . The most prominent feature of the acetabular region of the ilium is the laterally extensive and swollen antitrochanter. This is eroded laterally and consequently would have been even more pronounced in life (fig. 27, 30: anti) . A large antitrochanter is normal for dromaeosaurids (Norell and Makovicky, 1997; Turner et al., 2007a; Brougham and Brusatte, 2010; contra Alexander et al., 2010) . Anterior to the antitrochanter is a thin supraacetabular crest ( fig. 27: sac) , which is subtle and overhangs the acetabulum only slightly, as is normal for dromaeosaurids and many other coelurosaurs (e.g., Norell and Makovicky, 1997, 1999; Turner et al., 2007a) . The delicate morphology of the supraacetabular crest has been described as permitting a greater ranger of femoral abduction (Longrich and Currie, 2009; Alexander et al., 2010) , but the large antitrochanter of Balaur and other dromaeosaurids would in fact have precluded extreme lateral movement of the femur (Brougham and Brusatte, 2010) . In lateral view, the supraacetabular crest of Balaur is nearly horizontal, and is not as arched as in Bambiraptor (Burnham et al., 2000) , Deinonychus (Ostrom, 1969) , Velociraptor (Norell and Makovicky, 1997, 1999) , and other dromaeosaurids (e.g., Novas and Puerta, 1997; Hwang et al., 2002; Turner et al., 2007a; Longrich and Currie, 2009) . In concert with the shape of the crest, the acetabulum of Balaur has more of an anteroposteriorly elongated oval shape, compared with the more circular acetabula of other dromaeosaurids. This may be an unusual feature of Balaur, but we suspect that it is largely, or entirely, an artifact of dorsoventral crushing, and do not interpret it as an autapomorphy.",

Most of this region is smooth and slightly depressed, but posteriorly there is a pronounced oblique ridge extending anterodorsally from the antitrochanter; this ridge is mostly eroded on the specimen and only its ventral base is preserved (figs. 27, 30: obrid). This ridge is extremely well developed and much larger than similar oblique ridges present in Mahakala (Turner et al., 2011) , Unenlagia (MCF PVPH-78), and Rahonavis (US 8656). In these dromaeosaurids, the oblique ridge terminates dorsally in a large supratrochanteric process. Therefore, given the size of the ridge in Balaur, it is likely that an enlarged supratrochanteric process (relative to closely related taxa such as Velociraptor and Adasaurus) would have been present at the eroded dorsal end of the ridge.",

Unfortunately, fine details of the pubic and ischial peduncles are not observable due to poor preservation, crushing, and complete fusion of the pelvic bones. It is clear, however, that the anterior region of the acetabulum is not open, but rather formed by an enlarged, anterposteriorly extensive fossa, which would have formed part of the articulation with the femur. This fossa is located on the posterior portion of the pubic peduncle, as in Velociraptor and other dromaeosaurids (e.g., Norell and Makovicky, 1997, 1999; Novas and Puerta, 1997; Turner et al., 2007a Turner et al., , 2012 . It is separated from the more anterior cuppedicus fossa ( fig. 27: cf) by the dorsoventrally trending ridge on the lateral surface of the pubic peduncle (the ''posterior bounding ridge'' of the cuppedicus fossa, described above; fig. 27 : pcfr). Unfortunately, the posterior fossa is largely covered by unremovable matrix on both sides of the pelvis, so it is not visible in the figures.",

                "text": "PUBIS: At first glance, the most remarkable feature of the pubis, which is also true of the ischium, is the extreme degree of retroversion ( fig. 27 ). With the iliac blade held horizontal for reference, the pubis and ischium are oriented at more than 55u from the vertical, and the ischium in particular appears to nearly parallel the long axis of the ilium. Although all dromaeosaurids and other basal paravians have a retroverted pubis, it is usually oriented at 10u-20u from vertical (e.g., Ostrom, 1969; Novas and Puerta, 1997; Forster et al., 1998; Longrich and Currie, 2009) . Velociraptor exhibits the most extreme retroversion of any other dromaeosaurid, with a pubis backswept at a 35u angle (Norell and Makovicky, 1997, 1999) , but this is still far less extreme than the condition in Balaur. Therefore, the pronounced retroversion of the pubis and ischium is considered an autapomorphy of Balaur, although some degree of increased retroversion may be shared by Balaur and Velociraptor, which are sister taxa, due to common ancestry. However, we consider this autapomorphy only tentative, because it is likely that the extreme degree of retroversion in Balaur is at least partially due to dorsoventral crushing. That said, we do not completely dismiss this character as artifactual. Two lines of evidence suggest that at least some degree of greaterthan-average retroversion is present: (1) the pubis is still extremely retroverted on the less deformed right side; and (2) the shape of the left ischium (also highly retroverted) appears to be less affected by crushing. The more complete right pubis is 146 mm long as preserved, but the posterior margin is eroded, and comparison with close relatives suggests that several centimeters are missing. Therefore, based on these comparisons, the pubis would probably have been at least 170 mm long in life (table 2). Distal to the acetabular region the pubis tapers into an elongate, thin shaft. At its midsection the shaft is ovoid in cross section and measures 11 mm in mediolateral width by 9 mm in dorsoventral depth. The shaft is strongly curved when seen in dorsal or ventral view, with a convex lateral margin and a concave medial surface. The two pubes eventually meet on the midline and together define a wide region between them. Anteriorly, there is a pronounced ridge on the dorsal surface of the shaft, which dissipates posteriorly as the bone becomes wider mediolaterally and thinner dorsoventrally ( fig. 28: arid) . Farther distally, approximately 20 mm before the two pubes meet, another ridge emerges ( fig. 28:  prid) , which becomes more prominent as it continues distally and forms the lateral bounding wall of the dorsally concave pubic apron ( fig. 28: pa; fig. 31 ).",

The apron is separated from the shaft by a distinct change of curvature, and its ventral surface is nearly horizontal. Further distally, however, the ventral surface curves upward such that it also faces posteriorly, and based on the shape of the broken posterior surface it is likely that the distalmost portion of the ventral pubis would have faced almost entirely posteriorly. The apron is wider than the remainder of the pubis and the actual contact between the pubes is made by two discrete ridges of bone. The medial surface of the shaft is marked by a thin ridge, which begins immediately posterior to the acetabulum and becomes thinner as it continues distally, before meeting its counterpart to form the apron ( fig. 28:  mdrid) . This ridge is centered on the medial surface proximally, but migrates further dorsally as it extends distally. On the ventral surface, there is a ridge that begins at approximately midshaft, becomes more prominent distally, and eventually curves medially and migrates dorsally to join with the medial ridge forming the apron ( fig. 28:  mvrid) .",

The greatest interpubic width occurs slightly posterior to the acetabulum, where the two bones are separated by 72 mm. The intervening space remains wide for a considerable distance distally, in concert with the strongly laterally bowed pubes. Because each pubis is bowed to such a pronounced degree, the interpubic distance only begins to narrow at approximately 2/3 of the length of the bone. The narrowing occurs abruptly once it begins, unlike the condition in Velociraptor where the narrowing between the two pubes is more gradual over a long distance (IGM 100/986; Norell and Makovicky, 1999: fig. 17 ).",

It is 70 mm long as preserved and 15 mm deep dorsoventrally near its midpoint. Although both ischia are broken posteriorly, it can be inferred that they did not make broad contact at a symphysis, as there is no room for such a contact due to the intervening caudal vertebrae. This is also the case in most other maniraptorans, whereas in more basal theropods the ischia meet each other across a broad contact to form a symphysis (e.g., Madsen, 1976; Xu et al., 2006; Brusatte et al., 2008) . The long axis of the ischium parallels that of the pubis and the two are separated by a 12 mm gap at the midpoint of the ischium. The ischium is dorsoventrally deep proximally, where it forms the posteroventral corner of the acetabulum, due to dorsal and ventral expansions. The ventral expansion is formed by a greatly enlarged ischial tubercle, whose size and morphology are autapomorphic for Balaur (figs. 27, 30: it). A tubercle is present in Deinonychus (Hutchinson, 2001) and Velociraptor (Norell and Makovicky, 1997, 1999) , and is a synapomorphy that unites Balaur and these genera as a dromaeosaurid subclade. However, in these other taxa, the tuber is expressed as a small, discrete, rugose bulge (e.g., Norell and Makovicky, 1997, 1999) . In Balaur, in contrast, it takes the form of a large, thin flange that projects ventrally and nearly contacts the pubis. Since the ventral surface of the tuber is broken, it is possible that this flange actually did contact the pubis in life, which would comprise a further autapomorphy of Balaur. The dorsal expansion of the proximal region is formed by a separate flange, which is thin and concave laterally ( fig. 27: df) . It is not present in Velociraptor, but is seen in an undescribed dromaeosaurid (Norell and Makovicky, 1999: fig. 24 ; Montanari and Norell, in prep.). Between the dorsal and ventral expansions, the lateral surface of the ischium is deeply convex and smooth.",

The posterior expansion is due to a reorientation of the lateral surface, which here curves ventrally such that it now faces both ventrally and laterally. A similar, although less striking, twisting of the lateral surface is present in Velociraptor (IGM 100/986). The middle and posterior region of the ischium has a strongly rugose lateral surface, which is bisected by a crest that begins on the dorsal surface of the ischium near its midpoint, migrates posteroventrally up to a sharp inflection point, and then extends posteriorly along a nearly horizontal trend (figs. 27, 30: ic). The crest is most prominent at the inflection point, which forms a discrete corner. This ridge is present in many, but not all, dromaeosaurids, including Deinonychus and Velociraptor (Norell and Makovicky, 1997, 1999; Turner et al., 2007a) , Buitreraptor (Makovicky et al., 2005) , and Sinornithosaurus (Xu et al., 1999) .",

The right hind limb, in contrast, is represented only by a fragmentary metatarsus (fig. 37) . The distal portion of the hind limb of Balaur is substantially modified relative to other dromaeosaurids (and indeed all other dinosaurs) in regards to fusion, size, shape, and the development of the digits. The tibia, fibula, and proximal tarsals are fused into a tibiotarsus and sutures between individual bones have mostly been obliterated, although they can be traced in some places as raised ridges. The distal tarsals and metatarsals II-V are fused into a stout tarsometatarsus, which is proportionally short in comparison to the metatarsus of closely related taxa such as Velociraptor (Norell and Makovicky, 1997, 1999 Makovicky, 1999) . Comparisons between the hind-limb ratios of Balaur and other dromaeosaurids are provided in table 6 (see also figs. 45-46) . The proximal surface of the tibia is heavily eroded, but much of the cnemial crest is preserved ( fig. 33: cn) . The crest is prominent, 10 mm wide mediolaterally by 10 mm long anteroposteriorly as preserved, and curves laterally as it continues anteriorly, as is normal for dinosaurs (Gauthier, 1986; Novas, 1996; Brusatte et al., 2010; Nesbitt, 2011) . The proximal surface of the crest slopes laterally, and as a result the medial region of the crest is higher than the lateral region, suggesting that the lateral condyle of the femur extended further distally than the medial condyle. Distally, the cnemial crest gradually merges with the shaft, and in doing so twists medially such that it terminates along the anteromedial edge of the shaft. Posteriorly, the proximal surface separates into lateral and medial condyles, both of which are heavily eroded. The incisura tibialis, the notch between the cnemial crest and lateral condyle along the lateral surface of the tibia, is visible as a concave margin in proximal view. This notch is moderate in size, 6 mm long anteroposteriorly and inset 2 mm into the lateral surface. Both the cnemial crest and lateral condyle project to the same level laterally, and as a result the incisura tibialis opens only laterally and is not visible in anterior or posterior views.",

The crest begins at, or immediately ventral to, the proximal articular surface and curves slightly anteriorly, while expanding in width, to nearly merge with the anterior surface of the cnemial crest. Between this crest and the cnemial crest, and facing anteriorly and medially, is a smooth fossa, which dissipates distally as both crests merge with the shaft ( fig. 33: fo) . The medial crest and associated fossa are unusual features that also appear to be present, albeit much more subtly, in Deinonychus (Ostrom, 1969) , Velociraptor (IGM 100/986), and Rahonavis (UA 8656), and may be present in other taxa (but perhaps sometimes are imperceptible due to the delicate nature of the crest or poor preservation in this area). The medial crest may be homologous at some level with the medial cnemial crest of alvarezsaurids, which is a unique character present in derived members of this clade (Perle et al., 1994; Turner et al., 2007a) . However, the alvarezsaurid crest is positioned at the anteromedial corner of the cnemial crest itself, not on the medial surface of the tibia as in Balaur. Furthermore, basal alvarezsaurids lack a medial cnemial crest, as do other coelurosaurs, suggesting that the crests of derived alvarezsaurids and dromaeosaurids evolved independently (Choiniere et al., 2010) .",

The anterior surface of the crest is smoothly concave, and is essentially a ventral extension of the smooth incisura tibialis. This concavity faces solely laterally on the proximal portion of the fibular crest, but twists distally such that it terminates on the anterior surface of the tibial shaft. The medial surface of the shaft bordering the fibular crest is damaged, but a region of collapsed bone indicates that there may have been a fossa here, as in Velociraptor (IGM 100/986). Further distally on the shaft it is unclear how much contact there was between the fibula and the tibia, as the former bone is largely eroded in this area. It is clear that the fibula is separated and unfused to the tibia immediately distal to the fibular crest (up to about 2/3 of the length of the tibiotarsus), and then further distally it appears as if the two bones abut each other and fuse into a common element (with indistinguishable sutures).",

The medial surface of the proximal end is smoothly concave and lacks the discrete, deep fossa present in more basal theropods, including basal coelurosaurs such as tyrannosauroids and ornithomimosaurs (e.g., Madsen, 1976; Brochu, 2003; Makovicky et al., 2004; Brusatte et al., 2008) . Although the proximal region is somewhat eroded, it appears that the fibula was more expanded posteriorly than anteriorly. As seen in lateral view, the anterior margin of the shaft is approximately straight, whereas the posterior margin is concave and curves strongly posteriorly as it continues proximally, in concert with the more expanded posterior end of the proximal fibula. The iliofibularis tubercle is proximally positioned, beginning approximately 41 mm distal to the proximal end of the bone. It is expressed as a slight, convex bulge on the posterior surface of the shaft, not a large rugosity as in some basal coelurosaurs, especially tyrannosauroids (e.g., Brochu, 2003) . The morphology of the distal fibula is not clear, as the tibia, fibula, and proximal tarsals are strongly fused here ( fig. 34 ). There is a pronounced lateral tubercle on the distal end of the tibiotarsus ( fig. 35: lt) , which is in the same approximate position as the distal end of the fibula in Velociraptor (IGM 100/986) and therefore may represent the distalmost extent of the fibula.",

Complete fusion between the proximal tarsals and the tibia and fibula is rare among coelurosaurs, present otherwise only in Buitreraptor (Makovicky et al., 2005) and Graciliraptor (Xu and Wang, 2004) among dromaeosaurids (see Norell and Makovicky, 1997; Turner et al., 2007a) . Because fusion is so extreme in this region, it is possible to describe only the various surfaces of the distal tibiotarsus without reference to the individual bones. The distal surface of the tibiotarsus is saddle shaped, comprised of medial and lateral condyles that are separated by a wide and deep sulcus, which continues onto the posterior surface of the bone as a flexor groove. The anterior surface is deeply notched at its center as an extensor groove, which is visible in distal view as an inset, concave margin. This groove is inset approximately 8 mm into the bone as preserved, but was likely deeper since the anterior surfaces of the lateral and medial condyles, which define its anterior extent, are eroded. Although deep, the groove is only 5 mm wide mediolaterally. The prominent and deep extensor groove is an unusual feature among dromaeosaurids, present otherwise in Buitreraptor (Makovicky et al., 2005) . Other dromaeosaurids, including Velociraptor (IGM 100/986; Makovicky and Norell, 1999) have a much shallower groove, which is considerably wider than deep. A deep groove is present, however, in some alvarezsaurids, troodontids, and basal avialans (Turner et al., 2007a) , and therefore is homoplastic within coelurosaurs.",

The ridge is most pronounced anteriorly, where it terminates at a discrete rounded tubercle ( fig. 35: lt) located at the point where the lateral condyle merges with the shaft of the tibiotarsus. This ridge may represent the line of fusion between the calcaneum and tibia, as its shape and position approximates the trace of this suture in many theropods (e.g., Velociraptor: IGM 100/986). If this is the case, then the fibula would contact these bones on, or near, the discrete tubercle, suggesting that the tubercle itself may represent the distal end of the fibula. Ventral to the ridge, the lateral surface of the tibiotarsus is smoothly concave. However, the ridge is kinked at its midpoint ( fig. 35: vk) , forming another small tuber that projects ventrally. Additionally, there is a sharp ridge along the anterior margin of the lateral surface, which forms the anterolateral corner of the bone ( fig. 35:  arid) . This ridge begins at the proximal tip of the large tuberosity and extends proximally until it terminates against a broken surface. It is most pronounced distally and becomes less prominent and thinner as it continues proximally. It is likely that this crest represents the portion of the fibula that tapers distally before slightly expanding to articulate with the tarsus. The medial surface of the distal tibiotarsus (presumably formed by the medial condyle of the astragalus) is marked by a deep, circular pit ( fig. 35: mp) . This feature is generally prevalent among dromaeosaurids, as it is present in Velociraptor (IGM 100/986), Deinonychus (YPM 5226), Neuquenraptor (MCF PVPH 77), Microraptor (IVPP V13352), and Mahakala (IGM 100/1013). The presence or absence of this feature in Adasaurus cannot be determined because the relevant portion of the astragalus is not sufficiently prepared. The especially deep morphology of the pit of Balaur may be unusual among dromaeosaurids, but the depth of this depression is variable in other taxa, and is sometimes even variable between left and right sides in individual skeletons (e.g., Velociraptor IGM 100/986).",

Fusion between the distal tarsals and metatarsals, as well as between the proximal ends of the metatarsals, is rare among nonavialan coelurosaurs. It is present in the oviraptorosaurs Elmisaurus (Osm\u00f3 lska, 1981) and Avimimus (Vickers-Rich et al., 2002) , and the alvarezsaurid Albinykus (Nesbitt et al., 2011) ; in dromaeosaurids it is also present in Velociraptor (Norell and Makovicky, 1997, 1999) , Adasaurus (IGM 100/21), and Microraptor (Hwang et al., 2002) , albeit to a much less extensive degree, as in these taxa the sutures between elements of the tarsometatarsus are often visible. In Balaur, only the line of fusion between the tarsal cap and the metatarsus is visible, and it is clear that the tarsals are thickened proximodistally. The proximal surface of the tarsus is convex and smooth ( fig. 36-37) . Metatarsals II-V are heavily fused to each other proximally and sutures between individual bones are not clear (figs. 36-37: fus). The fused region is approximately 8 mm in proximodistal length, and further distally the individual metatarsals separate from each other. However, it is possible that fusion continued distally, as the individual metatarsals are in close contact throughout their lengths. Furthermore, in both the left and right feet the regions between metatarsals II-IV are poorly preserved. Each metatarsal thins dramatically in dorsoventral (extensor-flexor) depth toward its lateral and medial margins, and these surfaces are largely broken. Therefore, it is possible that the broken surfaces may have contacted each other in life. Regardless, it is clear that the metatarsals were separated at their extreme distal ends, as the individual distal articular surfaces are unfused and diverge from each other.",

As in most other theropods, including all other dromaeosaurids, this bone is a small, wedgelike element with a flat lateral surface that articulates along the midpoint of the medial surface of metatarsal II (e.g., Ostrom,1969; Forster et al., 1998; Norell and Makovicky, 1997, 1999; Hwang et al., 2002; Novas and Pol, 2005) . Although metatarsal I supports large and functional phalanges (see below; fig. 36 ), it does not reach the tarsus, as is the case in derived therizinosauroids that independently evolved a large pedal digit I (e.g., Perle, 1979; Barsbold and Perle, 1980) . The enlarged nature of the first digit of Balaur is reflected in the size of metatarsal I, however, which although still smaller than the other metatarsals is proportionally larger than in all other dromaeosaurids (e.g., Deinonychus: MCZ 4371, Ostrom, 1976 ; Velociraptor: IGM 100/986, Norell and Makovicky, 1999) . Indeed, while in these velociraptorines the length of metatarsal I varies between 25%-28% of that of metatarsal III, in Balaur it reaches 60% (table 6 ; see also fig. 47 ). This ratio is well below 25% in other derived dromaeosaurids and drops below 20% in the microraptorines and unenlagiines (table 6 ; see also fig. 47 ).",

Its lateral margin, on the other hand, thins into a platelike flange that may have made contact with metatarsal III (see above). As a result of this morphology, there appears to be a strong ridge, oriented proximodistally, along the medial edge of the bone in extensor (dorsal) view ( fig. 37: rid) . This ridge is not a discrete structure, but rather reflects the difference between the thick medial edge and thin lateral half of the bone. Similar ridges are present on metatarsals III and IV, also a result of the thinning of the metatarsals toward one or both edges, and are autapomorphic of Balaur. In contrast, the metatarsals of other dromaeosaurids, including Deinonychus (Ostrom, 1969), Microraptor (Hwang et al., 2002) , Rahonavis (Forster et al., 1998) , Unenlagia (Novas and Pol, 2005) , and Velociraptor (IGM 100/985) do not thin toward their edges, and hence do not appear to possess large ridges on their extensor surfaces. Velociraptor has an oblique ridge on metatarsal III, but this does not extend across the length of the shaft and is not associated with thin edges of the bone, nor with similar ridges on metatarsals II and IV (Norell and Makovicky, 1999) . Furthermore, in some dromaeosaurids, including Velociraptor (IGM 100/986) and Adasaurus (IGM 100/21), a tubercle is present on the extensor surface just proximal to midshaft that likely corresponds to the insertion of M. tibialis cranialis. No such tubercle is present in Balaur.",

It is most deeply inset distally, where it is invaginated underneath the distal condyles, which extend onto the extensor surface to slightly overhang the pit. The anterior margin of the pit is smoothly convex and its lateral and medial edges are formed by thin ridges that continue proximally from the corner of each distal condyle. The flexor (ventral) surface of metatarsal II is collapsed proximally on the right metatarsus in which this surface is visible, indicating that a fossa was present in this region. Further distally, around midlength, the flexor surface flattens out, then becomes slightly convex, and eventually is concave as a small flexor cleft where it terminates against the distal condyles.

This morphology is indicative of less extreme hyperextensive abilities compared to close relatives, but several troodontids also are capable of hypextension without a ginglymoid metatarsal II (e.g., Xu et al., 2002; Turner et al., 2007a) . The distal condyles are, however, separated on the flexor surface of the metatarsal. Here, the medial condyle, which is nearly circular, projects further ventrally (toward the flexor direction) than the lateral condyle, which is ovoid, larger than the medial condyle, and extends farther proximally and distally. The long axis of both condyles projects mediodistally, and as a result, digit II curves medially away from digit III, as is normal for dromaeosaurids (e.g., Ostrom, 1969; Norell and Makovicky, 1997, 1999) . Unusually, the width of the distal articular surface is less than the width of the entire distal end of the metatarsal. This is especially evident in extensor view, where a large nonarticular region is present both lateral and medial to the smooth articular surface. This is not the case in other dromaeosaurids, including Deinonychus (Ostrom, 1969) and Velociraptor (Norell and Makovicky, 1997, 1999) , and therefore is an autapomorphy of Balaur.",

The ridge is most pronounced at the center of the shaft, and lateral and medial to it are smooth fossae that slope away from the long axis of the bone. Distally, the portion of the extensor surface between the bifurcated ridges is depressed as a shallow extensor fossa, which is deepest distally adjacent to the distal articular surface. As in metatarsal II, the fossa is invaginated due to the overhanging distal articular surface, and the articular surface itself is slightly narrower than the total mediolateral width of the distal end.

The articular region divides into medial and lateral condyles on the flexor surface, but these are much smaller than the corresponding condyles in metatarsal II and are only visible in flexor view. The condyles are symmetrical, extend to the same level distally, have long axes that are oriented straight proximodistally, and continue proximally as thin ridges which merge with the lateral and medial edges of the bone. They are separated by a narrow flexor cleft. Further proximally, the flexor surface flattens out and then eventually becomes concave adjacent to the proximal articular surface. The flat portion is bisected by a subtle, proximodistally extending ridge, which abruptly ends distally against the flexor cleft. Distally, the distal articular end of metatarsal II abuts the medial edge of the shaft of metatarsal III, and this contact is reinforced by a small, convex tuberosity on metatarsal III.",

Shallow fossae border the ridge both medially and laterally, the latter of which is small and narrows in width distally in concert with the lateral migration of the ridge.

The hooklike morphology of this bone is the result of a concave extensor margin and convex flexor edge. Moreover, metatarsal V of Balaur is uniquely shortened among dromaeosaurids, at less than 30% of metatarsal III length, whereas this ratio exceeds 40% in all derived dromaeosaurids and approaches 50% in the more basal microraptorines (table 6; fig. 47 ). In articulation, it is positioned only slightly lateral to metatarsal IV and is displaced ventrally (toward the flexor direction) relative to the level of the other metatarsals, and as a result there is a deep notch between metatarsals IV and V. The lateral surface of the bone is smooth and the muscle attachment sites that are so apparent in many large theropods (e.g., Currie and Zhao, 1993; Brusatte et al., 2008) are not present. There does, however, appear to be a slightly convex tuber on the distal portion of the flexor margin.",

In addition we used histological examination to infer whether the heavily sculptured external cortical texture characteristic of all the long bones is a genuine biological feature (related to osteogenesis) or the result of postmortem erosion or other taphonomic alteration ( fig. 39) . Histological examination was carried out by two of us (A. W. and G.M.E.) . A diaphyseal section of the left fibula of the holotype (EME PV.313, a fragment from the distalmost end of the broken shaft) and a hemisection of the isolated left ulna (LPB [FGGUB] R.1581) (48 mm from the proximal end and 83.3 mm from the incomplete distal end) were extracted and embedded in clear epoxy resin (EpoxySet: Allied High Tech Products, Inc., Rancho Dominguez, California). The segments were then serially sectioned at 1.5 mm intervals transverse to the long axes of the bones using a slow-speed bone saw fitted with a diamond-tipped blade (Isomet, 1000; Buehler Inc., Lake Bluff, Illinois). The sections were subsequenly affixed to petrographic slides using cyanoacrylate adhesive. They were then sanded on a rotary polisher (RotoPol11 polisher; Struers Inc., Cleveland, Ohio) to 60-100 mm using descending grades of silicon carbide paper with water as an irrigant. The thin sections were viewed using a polarizing petrographic microscope and the histological patterning described (cf. Francillon-Vielliot et al., 1990) . Unfortunately, the microstructure of both specimens was heavily damaged by postmortem extensive fungal damage, remodeling, and the hollow nature of the bone, the primary cortical bone types deposited early in ontogeny were indeterminable. The outer third of the cortex is composed of parallel-fibered matrix with sparse longitudinal vascularization. The matrix is interrupted by lines of arrested growth (LAGs). At least seven are present and their spacing diminishes nearer the periosteal surface. The deepest LAGs show negligible folding, whereas the outermost ones follow the contours of the external bone sculpturing manifest at the perisoteal surface ( fig. 40A) .",

The presence of dense Haversian bone, diminished spacing between LAGs near the periosteal surface, parallel-fibered bone deposited just prior to death, and negligible vascularization suggest that this individual is a skeletally mature individual (i.e., nearly full grown at the time of death). The extensive folding seen only in the outermost LAGs shows that the peculiar scultured texture of B. bondoc long bones is not a result of diagenesis or taphonomic alteration (e.g., chemical or biological erosion), but rather is a natural osteogenic developmental feature, one that manifested itself very late in the life of EME PV.313. Whether this feature is a nondebilitating or debilitating product of senescence, a response to disease, or even a functional attribute is indeterminable at this time, but is worthy of further study as new specimens are found and comparative histological datasets (of both extinct and extant taxa) are expanded. 40C ). This shows fibro-lamellar matrix with circumferential vascularization. The outer two-thirds of the cortex is composed of parallel-fibered matrix with sparse longitudinal vascularization ( fig. 40B ). The matrix is interrupted by LAGs. There are at least six of these and their spacing substantially diminishes nearer the periosteal surface. As with the fibula from the holotype, the deepest LAGs show negligible folding whereas the outermost ones follow the sculpturing seen at the perisoteal surface ( fig. 40B, D) The results from the LAG count suggest that LPB (FGGUB) R.1581 was no less than six years of age at the time of death. However, based on the distance from the innermost preserved LAG to the centroid, and the sample's distance from midshaft, this individual is likely several years older. The presence of dense Haversian bone and the attenuated spacing of the outermost LAGs suggest that this individual is (like the B. bondoc holotype EME PV.313) skeletally mature (i.e., full or nearly full grown at the time of death). The extensive folding of only the outermost LAGs, as was also seen in EME PV.313 (see above) , suggests that the peculiar sculptured texture of Balaur long bones is not a result of diagenesis. It is a natural late developmental osteogenic feature present on both specimens, which as discussed by Csiki et al. (2010a) are of different body size and were discovered at different localities that may be slightly different in geological age.",

Within Dromaeosauridae, Balaur is placed in an unresolved position (polytomy) with Velociraptor, Deinonychus, and Adasaurus. This position of Balaur is generally consistent with the phylogenetic position recovered by the original phylogenetic analysis of Csiki et al. (2010a) , which used a dataset that is a subset of the dataset employed here. Csiki et al. (2010a) found Balaur as the sister taxon to Velociraptor mongoliensis, a result that is not recovered in the strict consensus topology of the new phylogenetic analysis (but is present in many of the individual most parsimonious trees). Part of this lack of resolution in the current analysis is a result of uncertain placement of Adasaurus mongoliensis, but an additional source of uncertainty is from two alternate placements of Balaur.",

The other set of most parsimonious trees finds Balaur as the sister taxon to a Velociraptor mongoliensis plus Deinonychus antirrhopus clade. This position is supported by pleurocoels absent on all sacral vertebrae (char. 113.0) and a pubic shaft that curves posteriorly, forming an anteriorly convex pubis (char. 180.2).

The holotype of Balaur bondoc is by far the most complete, best preserved, and diagnostic theropod specimen from the final ,50 million years of the Cretaceous in Europe, and as such, provides critical information on European dinosaur faunal evolution (see below). In contrast to the well preserved skeleton of Balaur, most previous records of European Late Cretaceous theropods have been limited to teeth and fragmentary, and usually disarticulated, bones. The most comparable and important of these records include a variety of specimens from the Transylvanian area of Romania (e.g., Andrews, 1913; Csiki and Grigorescu, 1998; Kessler et al., 2005) , as well as from Hungary (e.g., \u0150 si and Rabi, 2006; \u0150 si et al., 2010a) and France (e.g., Vullo et al., 2007; Chantasit and Buffetaut, 2009) . These specimens were reviewed in detail, and compared with the holotype of Balaur, in the supplementary information of Csiki et al. (2010a) .

Subsequently, various authors assigned additional material to this taxon, which usually could not be compared directly with the fragmentary type material (e.g., Lambrecht, 1929; Grigorescu and Kessler, 1981) . Later workers also disagreed on the taxonomic affinities of both the Elopteyx type and referred material, with some authors suggesting derived avian affinities (e.g., Lambrecht, 1929; Harrison and Walker, 1975) and others arguing that some, or all, of this material belonged to small nonavian coelurosaurian theropods (e.g., Martin, 1983; Grigorescu, 1984; Le Loeuff et al., 1992; Csiki and Grigorescu, 1998; Naish and Dyke, 2004; Kessler et al., 2005; Weishampel and Jianu, 2011) .",

For the sake of this paper, however, it is important to point out that the holotype of Balaur cannot be compared to the holotype of Elopteyx because there is no overlapping material between the two speci-mens. It may be noteworthy that both Balaur (holotype and additional referred specimens) and the specimens referred to Elopteryx, as well as other isolated bones from the Late Cretaceous of Romania, possess a similar woven and rugose external bone texture (Andrews, 1913; Le Loeuff et al., 1992; Kessler et al., 2005; Csiki et al., 2010a) . This may turn out to be an autapomorphy of a single species (which includes the holotypes of both Balaur and Elopteryx), but it could also represent a synapomorphy of a larger group, or perhaps an environmentally controlled feature unique to theropods living on the Late Cretaceous European archipelago. Therefore, we do not currently consider the presence of this single character as strong evidence for the synonymy of Balaur and Elopteyx.",

Locality information for much of this material is uncertain (many are simply labeled ''Transylvania''), and some of these are femora that, because femora are not preserved in the Balaur holotype, disallow direct comparison with Balaur. However, it is interesting to note that all these bones preserve the very unusual surface texture seen in both Balaur (holotype and referred specimens) and the holotype of Elopteryx. Although most of these specimens are referred to Elopteryx (both in print and in the museum's catalog) there is significant size and morphological differences among them. This suggests that there is probably more than one theropod taxon represented in this collection and that the unusual surface texture of the bones may be present on all, or many, of these small, island-dwelling theropods.",

Various teeth have been referred to dromaeosaurids, troodontids, and enigmatic tooth genera such as Richardoestesia, Paronychodon, and Euronychodon (Grigorescu, 1984; Grigorescu et al., 1985; Csiki and Grigorescu, 1998; Codrea et al., 2002; Smith et al., 2002; Vasile, 2008) . Unfortunately, these teeth cannot be compared to the dentition of the Balaur holotype, which lacks the entire skull and dentition. Similarly, a set of putative dromaeosaurid frontals, which were described by Weishampel and Jianu (1996) and identified as belonging to a Saurornitholestes-like taxon, cannot be compared to Balaur. Finally, a sacrum mentioned in passing by Nopcsa (1915 Nopcsa ( , 1923 and described in detail by \u0150 si and F\u0151 zy (2007) may represent an animal closely related to Balaur, but it is difficult to compare the two specimens (because Nopcsa's specimen is fragmentary), and our comparisons indicate that they do not share any unique derived characters. We find it likely that many of the isolated theropod remains from the Late Cretaceous of Romania do indeed belong to the same taxon as Balaur, but this is often difficult to test due to the lack of overlapping material, poor preservation, and the lack of clear synapomorphies.",

                "text": "HUNGARIAN SPECIMENS: Along with isolated teeth that cannot be directly compared with Balaur (\u0150 si, 2004), two peculiar specimens from the Santonian (middle Late Cretaceous) of Hungary belong to derived coelurosaurian theropods that may be close relatives of Balaur. First, \u0150 si et al. (2010a) named a new taxon, Pneumatoraptor fodori, based on a fused scapulocoracoid. Although Balaur also possesses fusion between the scapula and coracoid, these bones in the two taxa differ in detail. Most prominently, Balaur lacks the large pneumatic foramen on the coracoid that is an autapomorphy of Pneumatoraptor, whereas Pneumatoraptor lacks the hypertrophied coracoid tubercle that is autapomorphic of Balaur. It is also worth noting that other dromaeosaurids, such as Velociraptor and Microraptor, also possess fusion between the scapula and coracoid (Norell and Makovicky, 1999; Turner et al., 2007a) , so it is possible that Pneumatoraptor may be a dromaeosaurid closely related to Balaur. Second, \u0150 si and Rabi (2006) and \u0150 si (2008) described a fused tarsometatarsus, which they referred to an enantiornithine bird. The various characters used to unite this specimen with enantiornithines are also present in Balaur, which may cast doubt on this taxonomic assignment. Regardless, it is clear that the Hungarian specimen is distinct from Balaur for several reasons. First, the tarsometatarsus is much shorter proximodistally relative to its mediolateral width in Balaur. Second, the metatarsals are more closely appressed along their shafts in Balaur. Third, the Hungarian specimen lacks the autapomorphic ridges on the extensor surface of metatarsals II-IV in Balaur. Fourth, and finally, the Hungarian specimen lacks a metatarsal V that is fused to metatarsal IV as in Balaur. Therefore, none of the Hungarian specimens can be assigned to Balaur, which is not surprising, given that these specimens are about 15-20 million years older. FRENCH SPECIMENS: Coelurosaurian theropod specimens have been reported from both the Cenomanian (earliest Late Cretaceous) and Campanian-Maastrichtian (latest Late Cretaceous) of France. Isolated teeth described by Vullo et al. (2007) from the Cenomanian cannot be compared directly to Balaur, nor can teeth from the Campanian-Maastrichtian (e.g., Buffetaut et al., 1986) . However, two more complete and potentially diagnostic dromaeosaurid specimens from France can be compared to Balaur. The first, Pyroraptor olympius, is different from Balaur because it lacks the flat anterior surface of the ulna that is autapomorphic of Balaur. Furthermore, Balaur lacks the deep muscle attachment site on the lateral surface of the proximal ulna that Allain and Taquet (2000) described as autapomorphic of Pyroraptor.",

The importance of Balaur in illuminating biogeographic patterns was discussed briefly by Csiki et al. (2010a) and we here review the most salient implications. Balaur and other Romanian Late Cretaceous dinosaurs, as well as contemporaneous European dinosaurs more broadly, inhabited a series of islands during the Cretaceous, a time of warm temperatures and high sea levels (Csontos and V\u00f6 r\u00f6 s, 2004; Benton et al., 2010; Weishampel and Jianu, 2011) . Prior to the description of Balaur and other recently discovered herbivorous dinosaur taxa, it was thought that the Romanian dinosaurs, and Late Cretaceous European dinosaurs in general, comprised endemic faunas that arose through a lengthy process of in situ diversification (see reviews in Weishampel et al., 1991 Weishampel et al., , 2010 \u0150 si et al., 2010a Weishampel and Jianu, 2011) . This hypothesis held that most Late Cretaceous island species (and not only dinosaurs) were the descendants of Late Jurassic-earliest Cretaceous lineages that were stranded in Europe for tens of millions of years as sea levels rose. Support for this scenario stemmed from the primitive phylogenetic position of many herbivorous dinosaurs, reptiles, and mammals, which were found to be members of clades that seemed to be restricted to Late Cretaceous Europe and whose closest non-European relatives were considerably older taxa (see reviews in Benton et al., 2010 , Weishampel et al., 2010 Weishampel and Jianu, 2011) .",

The closest relatives of Balaur are primarily Asian and North American taxa of similar or slightly older age. Although the phylogenetic topology presented in this monograph differs slightly from that presented in the original description of Csiki et al. (2010a) , Balaur is still found to occupy a derived phylogenetic position, interspersed within a clade of Laurasian (Asiamerican) taxa. It is true that there are no other European dromaeosaurids in the analysis, so given the current sample it is impossible for Balaur to group with other European taxa in an endemic clade. Further discoveries may show that various species of Late Cretaceous European dromaeosaurids did form a clade. What is important, however, is that Balaur (and by extension any undiscovered close relatives) is placed within a wider clade that contains contemporary (and near contemporary) taxa from other continental areas. Balaur does not group with Late Jurassic-earliest Cretaceous coelurosaurs (such as microraptorine dromaeosaurids or the Utahraptor clade), nor is it a basal dromaeosaurid or a basal member of a derived dromaeosaurid clade, as would be predicted if the classic scenario of longterm island endemicity was correct.",

With this in mind, it is important to note that recent discoveries of hadrosaurian and ceratopsian dinosaurs in the Late Cretaceous of Europe also suggest that some herbivores were not merely endemic relicts, but rather members of clades with contemporary representatives on other landmasses, especially Asia (Dalla Vecchia, 2009; Pereda-Suberbiola et al., 2009; Prieto-M\u00e1 rquez and Wagner, 2009; \u0150 si et al., 2010b; Weishampel and Jianu, 2011) . Therefore, the emerging picture of European Late Cretaceous dinosaur biogeography is a combination of island endemicity and wider interchange. There is no doubt that many Late Cretaceous European taxa were endemic to some degree, as is attested to by the basal phylogenetic positions of some taxa (herbivorous dinosaurs such as rhabdodontids, nodosaurids, and basal hadrosauroids: Benton et al., 2010) and the extreme modifications of some taxa corresponding to their island environments (e.g., dwarfism, highly autapomorphic morphology: see below). However, not all European Late Cretaceous taxa were stranded on the European archipelago for tens of millions of years, but rather arose during periods of continued interchange between Europe and other landmasses during the Late Cretaceous.",

Data were collected either by directly measuring the specimens or from references with published measurements, and were tabulated to allow a comparison of limb structure and ratios across Dromaeosauridae. The measurements are presented in tables 4-7 and some are shown graphically in figures 42-47. We briefly discuss some of the more salient observations gleaned from this dataset. Note that we are simply discussing raw measurements and not standardizing by body size.

BALAUR: AN ISLAND-DWELLING THEROPOD Regardless of whether they become stranded on an island for a long period of time, or arrive as later immigrants, island-dwelling taxa often possess important skeletal and behavioral modifications well suited to their unusual habitat (the so-called island effect). This phenomenon has been widely noted in many modern and recently extinct islanddwelling taxa (e.g., Sondaar, 1977; Azzaroli, 1982; Palombo, 2008) . These modifications might include some or all of the following: size changes (either dwarfing or gigantism: e.g., Foster, 1964; Case, 1978; Lomolino, 1985) , morphological changes to the overall Fig. 45 .

Although inferred previously based on size-related and phylogenetic arguments in the case of several Late Cretaceous Romanian dinosaurs (e.g., Nopcsa, 1923; Weishampel et al., 1993 Weishampel et al., , 2003 Weishampel and Jianu, 2011) , the first well-supported report of insular habit-related modifications in dinosaurs was presented by Sander et al. (2006) , who noted the occurence of dwarfing and related life history shifts in the Late Jurassic basal macronarian sauropod Europasaurus, which lived on islands that comprised some of the land of present-day Germany. More recently, similar islandrelated life-history modifications were described in the titanosaur Magyarosaurus from the Late Cretaceous of the Ha\u0163eg Basin (Romania), a contemporary and sympatric Fig. 46 .

From within the same Late Cretaceous Ha\u0163eg assemblage, island dwarfing was also suggested to be present in the basal euornithopod Zalmoxes and the non-hadrosaurid hadrosauroid Telmatosaurus (Weishampel et al., 1993 (Weishampel et al., , 2003 Benton et al., 2010; Weishampel and Jianu, 2011 ; but see Osi et al. 2012).

Changes in body size are considered to be the most pervasive reaction to an island environment (Foster, 1964; Van Valen, 1973) , but Case (1978) documented no unique trend of body size changes in island-dwelling predators. Some predators, such as foxes, raccoons, and snakes, were reported to develop smaller sizes on islands, whereas others, such as bears and some mustelids, apparently increased in size. Moreover, Meiri et al. (2004) found no general size differences between island-dwelling carnivorous mammals and their mainland relatives, whereas in a later study, Meiri (2007) showed that carnivorous lizards exhibit different size trends on islands, with small species becoming smaller than mainland relatives but larger species growing relatively larger. Subsequently, using a phylogenetically controlled dataset, Meiri et al. (2008) demonstrated the tendency of certain recent mammalian island carnivores (especially viverrids and herpestids) to undergo size reduction compared to their mainland relatives, and similar trends have been noted for some, but not all, Pio-Pleistocene insular canids and hyaenids (Lyras et al., 2010; see also: Gompper et al., 2006; Van der Geer et al., 2010) . Recently, it has even been suggested that while insular dwarfing might be widespread in large-bodied mammal clades, it is largely absent in lizards or birds (Meiri et al., 2011) , which are more closely related to nonavian dinosaurs than are mammals (and, therefore, perhaps more applicable comparisons).",

Furthermore, even among mammals, it has been suggested that carnivore body-size evolution on islands is dependent mainly on prey abundance and size, and therefore is not necessarily controlled by an overarching ''rule'' of size increase or decrease (Raia and Meiri, 2006) .",

                "text": "With this information from living taxa in mind, what may Balaur indicate about body-size changes in insular carnivorous dinosaurs? Csiki et al. (2010a) argued that Balaur does not provide evidence for any clear body-size changes, especially dwarfism, among island-dwelling theropods, because it is of the same general size as closely related dromaeosaurids such as Velociraptor. This argument was based on both the holotype and referred specimens of Balaur, which at the time were considered to belong to a single species. We do note here, however, that the holotype and referred specimens are both skeletally mature individuals but drastically differ in body size (see above). The holotype specimen is somewhat smaller in size than closely related and contemporaneous (or near contemporaneous) dromaeosaurids; it is between 66% and 75% of the size of these other taxa, based on the length of the humerus (table 4) . However, it is not clear whether humerus length is a meaningful proxy for overall body size. Femur length and circumference, which are known to be tightly correlated to body size in theropod dinosaurs (Christiansen and Fari\u00f1 a, 2004) , cannot currently be measured in either of the Balaur specimens because the femora are missing. Therefore, the question of whether Balaur (and perhaps other theropod dinosaurs) exhibited some type of island dwarfism remains open, although we note that if dwarfism in Balaur was present then it was of a smaller magnitude than in contemporaneous herbivorous dinosaurs (Benton et al., 2010; Weishampel and Jianu, 2011) .",

Minor changes in morphology have been noted in fossil insular otters (Van der Geer et al., 2010) , but such changes are not unlike those known in certain mainland taxa and suggest only slight shifts in ecological traits such as feeding preferences.

In all of the above reported cases of island herbivores, development of a low-gear locomotion style is thought to have been linked to their restrictive insular habitat, characterized by a lack of predators to avoid (by fast locomotion), as well as a (relative) shortage of food resources that favored energy-saving locomotory adaptations. Moreover, shortening, increased robustness, and stabilization of the lower limb through fusion of the bones is thought to be instrumental in achieving stability during locomotion across rocky, uneven terrain, which is often widespread in insular environments. Stability during locomotion was also enhanced by lowering the center of gravity by means of the shortened and more robust limbs, as well as of a relatively wide pelvis, as described in Homo floresiensis (see Van Heteren, 2012). It appears, therefore, that Balaur exhibits a widespread morphological complex characteristic of insular taxa, but to our knowledge so far reported to occur only in herbivorous or omnivorous mammals. If insular mammals are a relevant comparison, the hindlimb modifications of Balaur may have been driven by the functional need for stability during locomotion, and not other factors such as release from predatory pressure. Empirical biomechanical studies are needed, however, to test whether Balaur did move in a substantially different fashion than close relatives such as Velociraptor.",

The entire skeleton of Balaur is remarkably divergent from other dromaeosaurids, as attested to by the presence of nearly 20 autapomorphies. We hope that future discoveries, especially of other islanddwelling predatory dinosaurs and close relatives of Balaur, will help further reveal which features of Balaur may relate to its island environment and help better understand the peculiar anatomy (and perhaps biology) of insular theropods.",
