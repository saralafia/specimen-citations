                "text": "By WILLIAM ROWAN [Plate 12] The accompanying sketch of the head of a bull wapiti in his fifteenth year was made in the Assiniboine Park, Winnipeg, Manitoba, in 1919. The spread of the antlers that year was approximately five feet. I understand from Mr. G. Champion, general superintendent of the Public Parks Board, that the antlers were at their best in 1917 with a spread of 61! inches. Even in 1911 this bull had an exceptionally fine head, but, although the spread was then already remarkable, the horns conformed more to the standard type. They then showed six points on the left side and seven on the right, the terminal tyne on this side bifurcating at the tip. I should be extremely grateful to readers of the Journal of Mammalogy if they could supply me with any authentic records of heads that surpass this one for spread. I have no doubt that such exist, but I have hitherto been unsuccessful in locating them.The length of the beam, on which I unfortunately have no accurate information, is not well shown on the sketch owing to fore-shortening, but was, in the fall of 1919, at all events, at least equal to the spread. It was altogether an extraordinarily beautiful head and most years showed perfect symmetry.This animal was captured wild in Manitoba in 1905, presumably at the age of about five months. He was mated for the last time in 1918 and was still evidently fertile, as a calf was born to his mate the following year. He was, however, already showing signs of senile decay and in 1920, owing to loss of teeth and semi-blindness, he was shot and buried. Alberta, Edmonton, Canada. ",
