                "text": "The Philippine Islands support one of the most diverse and species-rich island faunas of mammals in the world, with about 96 species of non-volant mammals and 70 species of bats; about 74% of the non-volant species and 40% of the bats are endemic to the Philippines (Heaney 1986) . The diversity of the fauna and the geological history of the Philippines appear to make the region ideal for studies of evolutionary zoogeography and ecology (Heaney 1985 (Heaney , 1986 . However, knowledge of the ecology of most species is very poor, usually being represented by a small amount of anecdotal information, or by nothing at all (e.g. Hoogstraal 1951 , Rabor 1955 , Taylor 1934 . We have recently begun to redress this deficiency by detailed inventory of mammal faunas at selected sites in the central portion of the Philippines (e.g. Heideman et al. 1987) . In this paper, we document the elevational range, relative abundance, and general habitat preferences of non-volant small mammals (shrews and murid rodents) and small fruit bats (Pteropodidae) along elevational transects on two islands in the central Philippines, Leyte and Negros. Leyte was a part of the Pleistocene island of Greater Mindanao, and has a species-rich fauna that is characteristic of that zoogeographic region; Negros is a relatively young oceanic island of the Negros-Panay zoogeographic region that has a rich bat fauna but has a depauperate fauna of non-volant mammals, apparently due to the low colonization rates of non-volant mammals (Heaney et al. 1981 , Heaney 1986 . For convenience we will refer to Leyte in this paper as a land-bridge island, in reference to its recent direct connection to the speciesrich island of Mindanao. However, it should be born in mind that Mindanao has had no direct connection to the Asian continent and is itself somewhat depauperate relative to islands that had connections to the Asian mainland, such as Borneo and Java (Heaney 1986) .",

Average rainfall from 1971 to 1986 at Baybay, on the coastal plain 7 km south of the campus, was 2050 mm; the driest month (May) receives an average of 75 mm, and the wettest (December) receives 245 mm (Heideman 1988) . Rainfall at higher elevations is probably higher. Mt Pangasugan lies at the western boundary of an area of primary forest that is 150 km 2 or more in extent, lying on and between the two principal ridges that run north-south down the west coast and the centre of the island (see map in Cox 1987) .

Emergent trees reached 30 m and dbh of up to 1.0 m; only a few had buttresses, and these were poorly developed. Canopy height was 15 to 20 m. Dipterocarp trees were uncommon, and a large arborescent gymnosperm made its lowest appearance near this camp. No leaves with emarginate (serrated) edges were noted. Epiphytes were quite common down to ground level, especially moss, orchids and ferns; pitcher plants were rare. Many trees had some moss, but on none did moss form a complete coat; moss was absent from leaf surfaces and from many tree branches and trunks. Woody vines and climbing rattans were common. The steepness of the terrain resulted in a highly broken canopy, so that ground cover was moderately dense, consisting of small saplings, tree ferns, ferns, erect terrestrial pandans, some viney pandans, palms, sedges and grasses. Leaf litter and humus were thick, often exceeding 0.5 m, and the humus and tree root systems gave the ground a springy resilience on the ridge tops.",

The site is the watershed of Lake Balinsasayao (9\u00b02 2' N, 123\u00b0 9' E, surface elevation 840 m); netting and trapping ranged up to 1100 m. By mid-1987, about 30% of the land had been cleared by subsistence farmers; the rest was primary forest. Canopy in this submontane forest is 20 to 30 m high, with dipterocarps (especially Shorea), a gymnosperm (Agathis), and figs (Ficus) as common emergents reaching 35 m to 60 m. Vines of many families are common; epiphytes, especially orchids, are common, but moss is uncommon. Leaf litter varies from thin to moderately thick, varying with the degree of slope. The sampling site at 1280 m on the upper slopes of Mt Guinsayawan was in transitional montane-ridgetop mossy forest, on a slight promontory on the NNE side of the peak. The sides of the bounding ridges were steep (50\u00b0 \u00b1 10\u00b0). The canopy was 10 to 15 m, with dbh of larger trees of 30 to 40 cm. Tree leaves were usually small, 20 to 40 mm, although some were 80 mm or more; a few tree leaves had sculpted edges. Because of the steepness, the canopy was often broken and ground cover moderately thick. Epiphytic plants and vines were abundant, with pandans and orchids especially common. Pitcher plants were present but scarce. Moss was common on most trees but rarely exceeded 2 cm in thickness, and many branches and some trunks were bare. Ground cover consisted of viny pandans, ferns, tree ferns, palms, saplings and herbaceous plants. The ground was thickly covered by a layer of dead leaves, humus and roots that reached 0.5 m in depth.",

Our data on fruit bats concern the small, abundant members of the family. The large flying foxes (Acerodon and Pteropus) forage on canopy and emergent trees, and fly long distances well above the canopy between roosts and feeding sites. Thus, because they may be found at nearly any elevation as they commute between roosts and foraging areas, and because they require special collecting efforts (shooting at roosting sites), we chose not to collect them. We did not capture the small fruit bat Eonycteris robusta during this study; it is a poorly known, uncommon bat of primary forest that has been taken on both Leyte and Negros (Heaney 8c Heideman, unpubl. data) .",

This not not associated with elevation per se, since mossy forest was found at 950 m on Leyte and 1500 m on Negros; appearance of the forest at the two sites was very similar (see Study areas). We also noted a decline in species richness in lowland agricultural areas; in mixed farm clearings and secondary forest on Leyte we found six species, and in the orchards on Negros we found only four species. In a region of upland farms at 600 m on Negros we took seven species, but two of these (H. fischeri and N. rabori) were very rare, and we believe that they were non-resident transients from nearby forest. Examination of patterns of overall netting success ( Figure 3 ) reveals more striking elevational structure. On both islands we found a tendency for netting success to decrease with increasing elevation, but this is confounded by two factors. First, capture success at any elevation was about three times higher on Negros than on Leyte (Figure 3 ). Second, capture success in agricultural areas was higher than at forest sites (10.9 to 3.9 per net-night vs. 4.4 to 0.45 per netnight, respectively), with the exception of the 850 m site on Negros.",

The first group includes the species most common in agricultural areas, Cynopterus brachyotis, Eonycteris spelaea, Macroglossus minimus, and Rousettus amplexicaudatus; all of these have been identified previously as species that are uncommon in primary forest, preferring areas with high levels of vegetational disturbance, especially agricultural land (Heaney et al. 1981) . We also captured a large number of R. amplexicaudatus on the college campus on Leyte, indicating their preference for disturbed sites. All of these species were much less common in forest sites, with the possible exception of M. minimus on Negros. The second group includes species confined to, or rare outside of, forest. Haplonycteris fischeri was present in all forest sites, but was common only on Negros at middle elevations ( Figure 2) ; only two individuals were captured outside of forest. Harpyionycteris whiteheadi was not common at any site, but was most common at middle elevations. It was not taken outside of forest, and was scarce at the highest site on each island. Nyctimene rabori is endemic to Negros; it is uncommon or rare at all of our forest sites, and we have taken only a single specimen away from primary forest. Ptenochirus jagori was a fairly common forest bat; it was absent from fully-developed mossy forest and was not common in transitional mossy forest (Figures 1 and 2) , but was taken in fair numbers at agricultural sites that were in or near secondary forest on both islands. However, P. jagori is absent from sites more distant from forest, such as Dumaguete. Ptenochirus minor, an endemic of the Mindanao faunal region, was common at all of our sites on Leyte, especially in lower montane forest.",

Haplonycteris fischeri is one of the two most common forest bats on Negros, but was rare on Leyte. For example, a comparison of its proportional abundance at the two most similar sites, the 500 m site on Leyte and the 850 m site on Negros, showed that it was significantly less common on Leyte (G-test, G = 87.8, DF = 1, P<0.005, comparing H. fischeri to all others). Four other bats, Cynopterus brachyotis, Harpytonycteris whiteheadi, Macroglossus minimus, and Ptenochirus jagori, did not differ proportionately in abundance at the two sites (G-test; for C. brachyotis, G = 2.18, DF = 1, P>0.10; for H. whiteheadi, G = 0.20, DF= 1, P > 0 . 1 0 ; f o r M minimus, G = 0.02, D F -1, P>0.10; for P. jagori, G = 0.54, DF = 1, P>0.10). However, these five species (the resident species shared between the two localities) all had higher capture rates on Negros than on Leyte (Tables 1 and 2) ; this is statistically significant (binomial test; P = 0.03). The magnitude of the difference is typically a factor of three or four. It is interesting to note in this context that the one species that is limited to Negros, N. rabori, is absent at most sites and rare at the others. Conversely, the one species we took only on Leyte, Ptenochirus minor, a bat similar in size to H. fischeri (36 g and 18 g, respectively), was the most abundant fruit bat at all of our forest sites on Leyte.",

We studied movements, survivorship, and habitat selection from June 1982 to September 1987 within the 302 ha watershed area of the lake (Heideman & Heaney 1989) . The site consists of two principal habitats: primary forest and agricultural clearings. Table 3 shows relative abundance of bats at 13 sites, six in forest and seven in clearings; each samples is composed of the first 100 bats captured at each site (using a random subsample from the last night). When all netting sites are combined, the total variation is quite high (Table 3) . However, most variation exists between the two habitats, and variance within a habitat is substantially lower. Several species that were rare in forested sites (C. brachyotis and M. minimus) were common in clearings, and the most common species in forest (H. fischeri) was less than one-fifth as common in cleared areas. Furthermore, comparison of capture rates (number per net-night) with density estimates from mark-and-recapture data (number per ha) yielded a strong correlation (r = 0.92; P < 0 . 0 5 ; Heideman & Heaney 1989) , demonstrating that capture rates directly reflect actual density at this site. These data provide functional confidence limits for our forest sites elsewhere. For a series of samples of 100 bats captured within a given habitat type, the relative abundance of individual species usually varied by no more than 10%, although occasionally by up to 20%. Given the magnitude of the between-site differences shown in Tables 1 and 2, where differences often exceed 50%, we conclude that the differences that are statistically significant are interpretable and biologically meaningful.",

On neither island was there evidence of a substantial change in number of species with elevation; the number ranged from three to five at a given site (Figures 4 and 5) . However, there was dramatic variation in trap success: on Leyte, trap success ranged from 1.8 to 4.4 per 100 trap-nights, and on Negros from 4.5 to 13.7 per 100 trap-nights. Although there is no overlap between the islands in mean and range of trap success, a plot of trap success against elevation ( Figure 6 ) could be interpreted simply as falling along a single curve of increasing small mammal abundance with increasing elevation. However, because the zonation of vegetation types differed on the two mountains and because we have no measure of seasonal variability of trap success, we urge caution in interpreting this seemingly simple trend.",

The relative abundance of small mammal species on Leyte varied significantly at our four forest sites (G-test, G = 70.26, DF = 15, P<0.005). Inspection of Table 4 and Figure 4 indicates that several patterns of variation are present. Two species (Crocidura beatus and Batomys salomonseni) were absent at 300 m and were most abundant at the highest site (950 m); one (Apomys sp. A) was present at all except the disturbed forest site at 50 m, but showed a similar pattern of increased capture abundance with elevation (Figure 4) . In contrast, one species (Bullimus bagobus) was most abundant at the lowest undisturbed forested site and absent at the two highest sites, and one (Rattus everetti) was present at all sites but most abundant at lower sites.

However, documentation for Old World fruit bats is generally poor, and it is unclear what causes the decrease. Our finding of an abrupt decrease in bat species richness in mossy forest, on both islands but at different elevations, suggests that changes associated with mossy forest may play a predominant role. We suggest that one important factor is the reduction in abundance of Ficus in mossy forest; current evidence indicates that H. fischeri, Nyctimene rabori, Ptenochirus jagori, and probably P. minor all rely heavily on the fruits of Ficus throughout much of the year (Heideman 1987 , Utzurrum 1984 . Harpyionycteris whiteheadi, which shows a lesser reduction in the mossy forest, feeds heavily on the fruit of species of pandans (Heideman 1987 , Utzurrum 1984 , which is common in mossy forest, as noted above. However, we also note that the lower temperatures, higher precipitation, and lack of open space beneath the canopy in which to fly may also contribute to the decrease in species richness.",

It is of interest to note that small mammals in forest on Pulau Tioman, a small island near the east coast of West Malaysia, were trapped at a rate five times that on the adjacent Malay Peninsula (28.6 and 5.0 per 100 trap-nights, respectively; Medway 1966), indicating that island area may have an important influence on abundance. Data from other parts of the world appear to bear this out as a general pattern (e.g. Lawlor 1983) .",

It is important to emphasize that we have been unable to find explicit documentation of temporal or microgeographic variation in mammalian species richness or relative abundance in Southeast Asia. Our own data on fruit bats indicate that temporal and microgeographic variation in species richness and abundance are generally much less than variation between sites (this paper; Heideman & Heaney 1989) . For trappable small mammals, observed species richness at a given site varies only very slightly, if at all, given the sample sizes reported here. On Negros and Leyte, for example, we rarely added to our list of trappable small mammals after the first 300 trap-nights (20-30 captures) from a given trapping session and elevation. However, relative abundance of non-volant small mammals (measured as trapping success) may be more variable over time. At a few sites, we have found substantial differences in trap success between trapping sessions. Although we lack samples large enough for an adequate test, we suspect that these differences are biologically important. Therefore, we urge caution in interpreting relative abundance data for rodents and shrews, especially when sample sizes are small, since temporal and microgeographic variation in relative abundance will complicate recognition of elevational patterns or differences between islands.",

The generality of this pattern among mammals is not known. The occurrence of non-native species of non-volant mammals in primary forest on Negros does not fit this pattern, but might be due to the paucity of indigenous species and opportunistic invasion of forest in the absence of competition (Heaney, work in progress).",

First, it is clear from these and other data that nearly all endemic Philippine mammals are forest dwellers; any degradation of the forest for logging or agriculture will inevitably have a negative impact on these endemic species. Second, many species normally exist at low population densities; in order to preserve these species, large parks will be essential for maintaining populations that are large enough to be viable. Third, in order to protect all of the species of a given region, it is crucial that a wide range of habitats be represented, from lowland dipterocarp forest to montane and mossy forest; in other words, reserves that encompass elevational transects, such as those centred on the higher mountains on each island, should be most successful.",

Given the apparent dispersal ability of the widespread species that characterize the agricultural areas and their presence in forest at low numbers on Leyte and Negros, we also predict that (5) on isolated oceanic islands where few endemic species are present, these widespread species, if present, will expand into forested areas.
