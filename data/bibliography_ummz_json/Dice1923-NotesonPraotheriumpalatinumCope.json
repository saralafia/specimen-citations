    "abstract": "Cope, who named it Praotherium palatinum. Cope later(1883) placed this form in the genus Lagomys (Ochotona), and in this allocation of the species he has been followed by most later authors. The type and only known specimen of this species consists of a palate with four cheek teeth on each side. It was originally part of the Cope Collection, and is now no. 8574, Department of Vertebrate Paleontology, American Museum of Natural History. It was collected in 1870, by Wheatley, in the Port Kennedy deposit. Through the courtesy of Dr. W. D. Matthew I have recently had an opportunity to examine this specimen. The fossil is much deformed by pressure. Although the teeth are present in apparently their original form, they are very fragile, and it is impossible to clean them thoroughly or to make out clearly their enamel patterns. However, the aid of Mr. Christman, an experienced preparator, was secured, and the faces of several of the teeth were cleaned as much as was safe. The first molariform tooth in the fossil is not conspicuously smaller than the second, as is the case with the first upper molariform tooth (p2) of modern Ochotona. It is possible that an anterior tooth in the fossil may be missing, and that the first tooth now found is p3, but from the indications on the palate this is not likely the case. Also, no trace can be found on this first tooth, or on the other cheek teeth present, of the conspicuous enamel crescent found on p3 of modern Ochotona. The condition of the fossil teeth makes it impossible to be sure that this crescent was not present in life, but it is not probable. The reentrant angles of the cheek teeth of the fossil seem to have extended little more than half way across the teeth, instead of nearly the whole distance across as in p', mt, and m 2 of modern o'chotona. There is some indication in the fossil that the inner portions of the reentrant angles of the cheek teeth were rather strongly crenulated or folded, but the condition of the teeth makes it impossible to be certain about the enamel pattern here. The evidence at hand seems to be sufficient to show that at least the fossil is distinctly different in its teeth from the living species of the genus Ochotona. Until more is known about the structure and relationships of the fossil it seems best, therefore, to use for it Cope's earlier name of Praotherium palatinum.",
