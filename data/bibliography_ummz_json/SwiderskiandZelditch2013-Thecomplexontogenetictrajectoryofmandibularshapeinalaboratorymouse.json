    "abstract": "The mouse mandible is a popular model system that continues to be the focus of studies in evo-devo and other fields. Yet, little attention has been given to the role of postnatal growth in producing the adult form. Using cleared and stained specimens, we describe the timing of tooth and jaw development and changes in jaw size and shape from postnatal day 1 (p1) through weaning to adulthood. We found that tooth development is relatively advanced at birth, and that the functional adult dentition is in place by p15 (just before the start of weaning). Shape analysis showed that the trajectory of mandible shape changes direction at least twice between birth and adulthood, at p7 and p15. At each stage there are changes in shape to all tooth-and muscle-bearing regions and, at each change of direction, all of these regions change their pattern of growth. The timing of the changes in direction in Mus suggests there are signals that redirect growth patterns independently of changes in function and loading associated with weaning and jaw muscle growth. A better understanding of these signals and how they produce a functionally integrated mandible may help explain the mechanisms guiding evolutionary trends and patterns of plasticity and may also provide valuable clues to therapeutic manipulation of growth to alleviate the consequences of trauma or disease.",

All the components of the mature mandible are present by embryonic day 17 (3-4 days before birth), when the expanding sheet of membrane bone has completed its envelopment of Meckel's cartilage, the dental primordia and the cartilages that will form the posterior processes (Ishizeki et al. 1999; Ramaesh & Bard, 2003) . But at this age, the posterior processes are relatively shorter than in the adult and are little more than cartilaginous rods ensheathed in bone where they join the horizontal ramus. The vertical plates that will provide structural support for the posterior processes have just begun to fill the spaces between them. Thus, the conformation of the newly formed mandible is quite different from that of the adult bone.",

                "text": "The substantial difference in shape between embryonic and adult mandibles leads to the question of what path the ontogenetic trajectory of the bone takes through shape space. More specifically, is the path straight or not and, if it is not straight, does it follow a mathematically simple curve (like a ballistic trajectory or a log spiral) or a more complex route that cannot be described by a simple formula? The answer to this question could have several important implications. The functional consequences of mandibular shape for feeding performance suggest that the ontogenetic sequence of shapes may influence an immature individual's ability to progress from nursing to processing foods typically eaten by adults (Biknevicius, 1996; Tanner et al. 2010; La Croix et al. 2011) . Consequently, variation in the ontogenetic trajectory of shape could affect fitness of both the offspring and parents. Variation in the trajectory can affect the offspring's ability to grow and mature, as well as produce deviations from the appropriate adult shape. Variation in the trajectory can affect the parent's fitness by its consequences for current reproductive effort and parental survival plus success of subsequent litters. In addition, the organization of variation in the ontogenetic trajectory (coordinated deviations or correlated downstream effects) may have implications for the potential evolutionary transformations of the trajectory and the target adult shape (Zelditch et al. 2009) .",

                "text": "Although the mouse mandible has become an important model system in studies of development, evolution and medicine, the progressive transformation of the newly formed mandible to the adult size and shape has not yet been described in detail. Numerous studies have analyzed covariance patterns in adults (Atchley et al. 1985; Bailey, 1985; Cheverud et al. 1997; Klingenberg et al. 2003 Klingenberg et al. , 2004 . Many others describe differences in adult form resulting from genetic divergence of laboratory strains or natural populations (Renaud et al. 2009; Sans-Fuentes et al. 2009; Boell et al. 2011; Mu\u00f1oz-Mu\u00f1oz et al. 2011; Burgio et al. 2012; Siahsarvie et al. 2012) . There also are several analyses of deviations from normal adult form caused by diet manipulations and mutations that directly or indirectly affect bone growth (Lightfoot & German, 1998; Fujita et al. 2004; Ramirez-Ya\u00f1ez et al. 2005; Rot-Nikcevic et al. 2007; Tsutsui et al. 2008; Renaud et al. 2010) . Many other studies have identified genes contributing to proper formation of the embryonic mandible (Depew et al. 1999; Ruest et al. 2004; Dixon et al. 2006; Shibata et al. 2006; Oka et al. 2007; Anthwal et al. 2008; Sun et al. 2012) . But despite this voluminous literature, there do not appear to be any studies that explicitly examine the ontogeny of mandibular shapes from neonatal to adult. A better understanding of this important transformation could serve as a starting point for investigating both evolutionary transformations of growth trajectories and potential therapies for abnormal growth.",

To provide a temporal and biological framework for this analysis, we first describe the timing of major developmental milestones in mandibular development (e.g. ages of tooth eruption and weaning). Then, using geometric morphometrics, we describe changes in jaw shape from postnatal day 1 (p1), through several closely spaced postnatal ages to a few days after weaning, evaluating the progress at those ages toward the adult shape, which is represented by a sample of 3-month-old individuals. We analyze the correlation of shape with mandibular size during postnatal growth and also evaluate the deviations of the jaw shape ontogeny from a linear trajectory. Our goal is to provide a basis of comparison for studies of variation in ontogenetic patterns in Mus as well as in rodents in general.",

Not only do the posterior processes (coronoid, condylar and angular) terminate in large cartilages; most of the bone that has formed is woven. Both tissues are quite vulnerable to mechanical damage and are difficult to image radiographically. To circumvent these problems, mandibles collected between birth and weaning were cleared and stained following a protocol modified from McLeod (1980) . This technique stains cartilage blue (Alcian blue) and bone red (Alizarin), and renders most other tissues transparent. The primary changes to McLeod's protocol were to decapitate animals immediately after anesthetic overdosing, and to skin the heads to allow more rapid diffusion. In addition, the amounts of time specimens were placed in each solution were extended as needed to stain and then clear the tissues of progressively larger specimens.",

If the autocorrelation of residuals seen in the original data exceed those in 95% of 400 replicates, the autocorrelation of the residuals was deemed to be significantly greater than expected by chance, and the model was excluded from subsequent analyses (Zelditch et al. 2003) .

After computing the direction through shape space that is maximally correlated with variation in size, the data were projected onto the regression vector to obtain scores representing their expected values. Additionally, principal components analysis (PCA) was used to visualize the major dimensions of variation, with scores on those axes providing a preliminary check for changes in the direction of shape change. Based on the PCA, which indicated that there are changes in the orientation of the trajectory, and life history, three intervals were delimited. To determine whether the ontogenetic trajectory changes direction by more than expected by chance, we measured the angle between the two phases. The angle between the trajectories is a common measure of the difference in orientation of two vectors (Zelditch et al. 2000) ; when the two vectors are in the same direction, the angle between them is zero, so the statistical analysis determines whether the observed angle exceeds that expected by chance. The test is done by first regressing shape on size, then randomly drawing two samples of residuals, with replacement, from each original sample (here, interval). For each of the two intervals, the residuals are added to the expected values for their size, and the angle is computed between the two vectors, a process that was iterated 400 times. This gives the distribution of angles that can be obtained by resampling within each interval. If the angle between the two original trajectories exceeds the angles between 95% of the resampling sets for both intervals, the angle between trajectories can be considered statistically significant and the directions can be considered significantly different.",

By p5, the crown of m2 also can be seen and the incisor alveolus now extends beyond m2. By p7, the crown of m1 appears to be nearly complete. Throughout this period, both m1 and m2 often are visible in dorsal view because the bone frequently does not grow completely over the occlusal surface before eruption begins; consequently, protrusion of m1 at this age may reflect that lack of bone growth rather than active extrusion of the tooth. In some p7 individuals, the length of incisor extending out of the alveolus is noticeably greater than in younger specimens, suggesting that incisor extrusion may have begun in those individuals. Molar eruption is evident by p10, but their roots have just begun to form. By p15, m3 can be seen through the bone, and by p18 it may begin to emerge through the alveolar bone. After p15, if not earlier, further elongation of the mandible is not needed to accommodate growth of the molars. The incisor root does continue to grow beyond the posterior end of the molar row, but the space it requires has already been provided by earlier growth of the condylar process.",

At p18, the model predicts jaw size will be at 90% of the asymptote and by p24, it will reach 95% of the asymptote, and this expectation was met by that sample. This model also estimated that onset of growth (T 0 ) was 6 days before birth when osteoid formation has just begun. The monomolecular model for shape maturation also predicted the observed values well at almost every age (Fig. 3b) . This is somewhat more remarkable than the fit to the size data because there are two intervals during which there appears to be little if any shape change (p3-p5 and p7-p10). For each of these two intervals, the curve of predicted values passes through the lower end of the range at the younger age and then through or near the upper end of the range at the older age.

Thus, the ontogenetic sequence of shapes can be fit to a linear trajectory, with slightly < 25% of the shape variation left unexplained. Figure 4 shows scores on that trajectory plotted against centroid size. These scores tend to be below the line between p5 and p10 and above the line at other ages, suggesting a slight lag in the amount of shape change between p5 and p10.

The angle between the second and third intervals is smaller, but still > 45\u00b0, and still significant. This second change in direction is not simply a reversal of the first change in direction; such a reversal would produce an angle of about 20\u00b0b etween the first vector and third. The second change in direction also is not a continuation of the first change in direction; that would produce an angle of about 115\u00b0b etween the first vector and third.

In the first interval, the diastema becomes narrower, longer and more curved; in the second interval, narrowing is relatively more important and the aperture starts to incline back; in the third interval, the aperture continues to tilt while increasing curvature becomes more prominent than lengthening and the posterior diastema thickens.

Thus, the path length is almost 30% longer than the straight line distance between starting and ending shapes.

As shown in Table 3 , the 95% confidence intervals for the three lengths do not overlap. In a stronger test for differences in length, the samples for two intervals were simultaneously bootstrapped and the difference in length between each pair of bootstrap sets was computed 2500 times. In these tests, the first interval was always longer than the third, and the third was always longer than the second, supporting the inference that the three lengths are significantly different.",

In the second week, there is greater emphasis on increasing the relative height of the coronoid process, the depth of the angular process and the thickness of condylar process. In the third week and continuing to the adult shape, the prominent features are increasing curvatures of the coronoid and angular processes and especially the diastemal portion of the ramus, along with a marked expansion of the angular and condylar processes. In each interval, there is growth and shape change in every anatomical region, and each change of direction between intervals entails changes in the ontogenetic trajectories of all regions.

Although that poor fit, especially the non-random distribution of residuals, suggested a non-linear trajectory, additional information was required to identify the time intervals in which the changes in direction occurred. Using PCA to help visualize the trajectory and the timing of key developmental events, we were able to delineate three intervals with very distinct directions of shape change. What remains to be determined is whether shape change is linear within intervals, and the abruptness of the change in direction between intervals.",

The ventral and anterior parts of the horizontal ramus and condylar process elongate to accommodate the antero-posterior addition of teeth and their expanding crowns. As tooth formation shifts from expanding the crown cross-sectional areas to increasing their heights and then extending their roots, growth of the ramus likewise shifts from elongation (and widening that could not be seen in lateral view) to progressively greater proportions of deepening. By p3, there is little or no dorsoventral separation between alveolar spaces for molars and incisor; consequently, the jaw must deepen at least fast enough to contain both the growing molar crown and the thickening and bowing of the incisor. When molar eruption begins at about p10, their roots have just begun to form; eruption appears to be necessary to make space for growth of the roots. From this age, the rate of bone growth no longer has to match the rate of tooth growth, just the difference between tooth migration upward and root elongation downward. While eruption is nearing completion and active gnawing and chewing begin, changes in ramus shape decrease and changes in shapes of the coronoid and angular processes increase to match the more rapid rate of muscle growth. At the same time, shape change of the condylar process shifts to relatively less elongation and more deepening; it no longer adds to ramus length, but to the robustness needed to withstand higher loads incurred during feeding on solid food.",

Analysis of embedded markers (Robinson & Sarnat, 1955) and histology (Bhaskar, 1953; Enlow & Harris, 1964; Bang & Enlow, 1967; de Buffr enil & Pascal, 1984) suggest such complex ontogenies cannot be completely explained by changes in relative growth of the cartilages but also requires changes in the pattern of periosteal deposition and resorption. Moreover, these studies all report patterns of growth and shape change similar to that seen in Mus mandibles. That mammals as diverse as rodents, rabbits, carnivorans, pigs and humans all exhibit similar complex trajectories suggests that this may be a common feature of mandibular development in mammals. One area where differences between taxa might be expected is in the distinctness of the stages and the abruptness of the transitions between stages. Most mammals have more teeth than Mus and relatively later onset of tooth development; longer faces with more teeth and later onset of tooth development could all contribute to smaller angles between directions of shape change and more gradual changes in direction. Crania, too, exhibit complex curving ontogenies of shape (Hingst-Zaher et al. 2000; Zelditch et al. 2003; Tanner et al. 2010; La Croix et al. 2011) . Changes in the direction of cranial shape trajectory may not be as closely tied to tooth development because the cranium encompasses the braincase, sensory capsules and pharynx, and these structures have their own ontogenies. Still, there are aspects of the changes in direction of skull shape ontogeny that reflect the pattern and timing of tooth and muscle development. The principal difference between growth patterns of crania and mandibles is that expansion of the braincase and sensory capsules adds to the complexity of cranial development.",

However, a morphology that is specifically adapted for juvenile size could allow immature offspring to exploit a transitional diet that reduces competition with the conspecific adults. This strategy has the added benefits that offspring need not be nursed until they are competitive with adults and that, after weaning, any further parental assistance with feeding or foraging can be shared between parents or even with other members of a social group.",

Numerous studies of phenotypic variation in mandibles of adult mice have been presented as supporting the hypothesis that the mandible is composed of two modules delineated at about the posterior margin of the molar row (Cheverud et al. 1997 (Cheverud et al. , 2004 Klingenberg et al. 2003; Burgio et al. 2012; Martinez-Maza et al. 2012) . The data collected for this study did not permit explicit testing of this hypothesis, but they are not wholly congruent with it. The changes in direction of the ontogenetic trajectory do not arise because first the anterior region of the jaw grows and changes shape, then the posterior. They also do not arise because the entire anterior region undergoes one change in its ontogenetic trajectory and the entire posterior region undergoes a different change in its trajectory. Instead, there appear to be multiple regions undergoing distinct changes in ontogenetic trajectory simultaneously, with different combinations of changes occurring at the p7 and p15 transitions. Rather than a two-part model, these results might be explained by several small modules undergoing simultaneous changes due to an overarching integration. The many small modules may reflect earlier developmental processes (Atchley & Hall, 1991) ; their partial integration may reflect their anatomical merging and functional interdependence (Monteiro et al. 2005; Zelditch et al. 2008 Zelditch et al. , 2009 Monteiro & Nogueira, 2009) . Studies of mandibular modularity have sometimes struggled to explain high levels of covariation between modules (e.g. Klingenberg et al. 2003) , and the palimpsest model of sequential, partially overlapping patterns of covariance driven by successive local developmental processes has been proposed to explain how modularity becomes obscured (Hallgr \u0131msson et al. 2009) . The results of this study suggest a hierarchical organization of integration could also fit such patterns.",

This non-independence is partly because the condylar process is a continuation of the horizontal ramusbone is added at the posterior end to provide the length needed to insert progressively more posterior molars. The positions and orientations of the coronoid and angular processes are adjusted to maintain their positions relative to the critical dentition. Increases in the areas and robustness of muscle attachment sites are associated with reinforcement and reshaping of the horizontal ramus to support the increased loads on the teeth and at the mandibular symphysis. Thus, functional interactions of tooth, bone and muscle require coordinated developmental outcomes even if the development of the components is separated in time. The observed pattern of shifting covariances of mandibular regions during postnatal growth is partly consistent with the palimpsest model. However, this pattern differs from that model in that all components are involved in each successive covariance pattern, whereas in the model, different partially overlapping combinations of components are involved in each successive covariance pattern.",

That these responses are larger in the posterior processes than in the horizontal ramus is consistent with the distribution of growth rates after weaning. This difference in magnitudes makes the posterior changes easier to detect; it does not make them independent of more subtle changes occurring in the horizontal ramus. Because tooth development is isolated from the environment and completed much earlier than muscle or bone development, the plastic responses of muscle and bone to environmental change will be constrained by the inherited tooth morphology. This dependence of muscle and bone on tooth morphology may explain why lineages with conserved dental morphologies tend to exhibit well defined trajectories of mandibular shape evolution.",

This, in turn, would allow the independent evolution of different stages in continuous ontogeny similar to that afforded by metamorphosis. In addition, the ability to coordinate outcomes of developmental processes that are separated in time would explain plastic or evolutionary changes in one region that do not result in excessive strain in another region, not only permitting the change but also accounting for its limits.",

                "text": "The genetic controls that might provide the overarching integration of multiple developmental modules and define the shape targets for bone growth remain obscure. There have been many analyses of gene activity during formation of the mandible, from migration of neural crest through deposition of the initial osteoid layer enveloping Meckel's cartilage and the tooth germs (Depew et al. 1999; Shibata et al. 2006; Oka et al. 2007; Anthwal et al. 2008; Tsutsui et al. 2008; Zhang et al. 2012) . Much less information is available regarding the genetic mechanisms directing subsequent growth. It has long been known that periosteal deposition and resorption contribute to growth and shaping of the ramus and posterior processes throughout this period (Bhaskar, 1953; Robinson & Sarnat, 1955; Bang & Enlow, 1967; Ramaesh & Bard, 2003) . Some studies suggest that these changes, as well as outgrowth and the posterior cartilages, can be influenced by hormonal disruptions (Fujita et al. 2004; Ramirez-Ya\u00f1ez et al. 2005) , muscle development mutations (Lightfoot & German, 1998; Nicholson et al. 2006; Ravosa et al. 2007; Rot-Nikcevic et al. 2007; Renaud et al. 2010; Vecchione et al. 2010) , changes in food hardness or consistency (He & Kiliaridis, 2003; Mavropoulos et al. 2005) , and orthodontic manipulation (Mavropoulos et al. 2005; Shen et al. 2006 ). Yet, it remains unclear what regulates the spatial distribution of those signals during normal growth to produce the ontogenetic sequence of shapes (Nicholson et al. 2006; Hsiao et al. 2010; Sun & Tee, 2011) . The results of this study suggest that this spatial distribution is repatterned twice during postnatal growth of the Mus mandible to produce the sharp changes in the direction of its ontogenetic trajectory. We infer that these changes in direction may provide important clues to understanding the patterning of growth as well as we understand its mechanism.",

Humans and other species of interest may not have such sharply delineated changes in the ontogenetic trajectory of shape, but those changes may still be tied to the pattern and timing of tooth development. Thus studies that seek to understand how growth signals are moderated to produce the target shape may benefit from the sharp angles and abrupt directional changes of the Mus ontogeny. The highly angular shape of the Mus ontogeny should help to delineate the phases to be contrasted; subsequent studies can then test whether similar agents produce more subtle changes in the directions of other ontogenies, including ontogenies of bones that do not have teeth.",
