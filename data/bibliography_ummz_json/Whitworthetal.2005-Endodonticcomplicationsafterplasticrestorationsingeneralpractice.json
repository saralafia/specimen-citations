    "abstract": "Aim To test the hypothesis that dentine and pulp protection by conditioning-and-sealing is no less effective than using a conventional calcium hydroxide lining. Methodology A cohort of healthy adults requiring a new or replacement restoration in a posterior tooth was recruited in six general practices. All procedures received local Ethics Committee approval. Exclusion criteria included signs and symptoms of pulp necrosis or inflammation, and patients unable to commit to a long-term trial. Cavity preparations were randomized to receive a calcium hydroxide lining or conditioningand-sealing with a smear-removing bonding system. Choice of bulk restorative material (composite resin or amalgam) was at the discretion of the dentist. The key outcome measure was evidence of pulpal breakdown identified at unscheduled (emergency) or scheduled recall examinations. Postoperative sensitivity was recorded on 100 mm VAS at 24 h, 4 days and 7 days. Pulp status was assessed at 6, 12, 24 and 36 month recall, and at any emergency recall appointment. The relationship between pre-treatment and treatment variables and pulp breakdown was assessed by logistic regression (P \u00bc 0.05). Results A total of 602 teeth were recruited, with comparable numbers of cavities lined (288, 47.8%) or conditioned and sealed (314, 52.2%). The majority (492, 81.7%) were replacement restorations, and amalgam was the most common bulk restorative material (377, 62.6%). A total of 390 (64.8%) restored teeth were reviewed at 6 months, 307 (51%) at 12 months, 363 (60.3%) at 24 months, and 279 (46.3%) at 36 months post-restoration. Sixteen cases of pulp breakdown were identified within 36 months of restoration placement, 11 presenting as emergencies and five detected at routine recall examination. Logistic regression showed that preoperative pain, cavity treatment by lining or conditioning-and-sealing and the use of rubber dam isolation had no association with pulp breakdown. Pulp breakdown was associated with deep or pulpally exposed cavities (P < 0.001, odds ratio 7.8) and with composite rather than amalgam restorations (P \u00bc 0.001, odds ratio 2.13). Re-coding to identify teeth with pulp exposures revealed that pulpal exposure was the key determinant of adverse pulp outcomes (P < 0.0001, odds ratio 28.4) and that composite resin restorations were again more likely to be associated with pulp breakdown than amalgam (P \u00bc 0.017, odds ratio 3.92). Conclusions Considered within the context of routine primary dental care, \u2022 Dentists can be confident that pulps will be equally well protected from post-restorative breakdown up to 36 months by calcium hydroxide lining and conditioning-and-sealing with adhesive resins. \u2022 Residual dentine thickness appears to be a key determinant of pulp responses after restorative dental treatment. \u2022 In deep and pulpally exposed cavities in posterior teeth, composites were associated with more pulpal breakdown than amalgams.",

Traditionally, clinicians have concluded that after the insults of cariogenic microorganisms and mechanical caries removal, pulps were vulnerable to chemical irritation from restorative materials themselves, or from acidic etching and conditioning agents applied to dentine (Browne & Tobias 1986) . Postoperative sensitivity which followed the insertion of a plastic restoration was attributed largely to material irritancy or thermal conduction through the bulk restorative material. In an effort to limit thermal and chemical injury, dentists have customarily 'protected' pulps with cement linings or bases (Pickard 1976 , Cox et al. 1999 . Calcium hydroxide-based cements have been particularly popular in this role, and were believed to actively promote the deposition of reactive or reparative tertiary dentine within the pulp (Schr\u00f6der 1985) .",

The data from the present study support this view, with a greater incidence of adverse events in deep and pulpally exposed than moderately deep or shallow cavities (odds ratio 7.8). Frank pulp exposure appeared to be most strongly associated with an unfavourable pulp outcome (odds ratio 28.4).

More critical than the cavity treatment may be the bulk restorative material and its long-term marginal integrity. Amalgam restorations are free from polymerization shrinkage events which may compromise the integrity of the tooth/restorative interface. In addition, even contemporary high copper amalgams improve marginal seal with time (Hilton 2002) . Composite resins, on the other hand, are technique sensitive, requiring incremental buildup to prevent excessive dimensional change during application. Polymerization stresses are believed to be particularly marked in materials with high filler loading which are typically used for posterior, loadbearing restorations (Braem et al. 1986 ). While they may be able, with careful technique, to develop tight interfaces with dental tissues in the short-term, this may not reflect in their long-term clinical performance, particularly in the wet environment of the mouth under conditions of thermal and mechanical cycling (Huang et al. 2004 , Nakabayashi 2004 .",
