    "abstract": "Tropical rain forest in Southeast Asia has developed within an extensive archipelago during the past 65 million years or more. During the Miocene (beginning 25 million years BP), rain forest extended much further north (to southern China and Japan); since that time it has contracted. During the Pleistocene (beginning 2.0 million years BP), development of continental glaciers at high latitudes was associated in Southeast Asia with lowered sea level, cooler temperatures, and modified rainfall patterns. Fossil pollen records demonstrate that Southeast Asian vegetation during the last glacial maximum (ca. 18000 BP) differed substantially from that of today, with an increase in the extent of montane vegetation and savannah and a decline in rain forest. These data show that the distribution and extent of rain forest in Southeast Asia has historically been quite sensitive to climatic change.",

But unlike the rain forest of Latin America and Africa that occurred naturally as vast expanses of nearly continuous forest, the forest of Indo-Australia is scattered on two continents and thousands of islands. In Indo-Australia, the area from Sri Lanka and India to New Guinea and northern Australia, this geographic discontinuity is strongly associated with exceptionally high localized biological diversity; the mammal fauna of the Philippines, for example, includes over 100 species found nowhere else (Heaney, in press) .",

In Indo-Australia, these factors have played crucial roles as well, but another variable, sea level, has been equally, and at times more, important. Current sea level is near to the maximum level that has existed at any time during the past several million years, but geologically recent glacial episodes often have resulted in sea level more than 100 m below the present level. Such changes have had relatively little effect on the land area of Africa or South America, but have drastically altered the area and configuration of Indo-Australia. These changes have directly influenced rainfall, adding to the complexity of the vegetational history of the region.",

India, Burma, and the Sunda islands all originated in this fashion, and Australia-New Guinea is in the process of moving toward and becoming incorporated into the Asian continent (Hamilton, 1979; Audley-Charles, 1987) . This process had begun at least by the Cretaceous (ca. 100 million years BP). There is evidence that parts of Burma, Thailand, the Malay Peninsula, and Sumatra were separate islands above water during the early Tertiary (ca. 40 million years BP), and because the islands were equatorial and temperatures were generally high at the time, it may be inferred that tropical forest existed, but no direct evidence is available (Audley-Charles, 1987) . The Philippine archipelago originated during this time as a series of small scattered islands in tropical seas (Hamilton, 1979; Mitchell et al., 1986) .",

Tectonic activity in the Philippines increased the size and number of islands (Vondra et al., 1982) , and Sulawesi was established as a significant island (Audley-Charles, 1987) . Emergent land problably extended from Indochina to Borneo in the Miocene, and both seasonal and everwet rain forest were present (Muller, 1972; Morley and Flenley, 1987) . Substantial evidence indicates that tropical rain forest extended as far north as southern China (Song et al., 1984) and southern Japan (Tsuda et al., 1984) and westward to northern India (Mathur, 1984) during the late Miocene (prior to 15 million years BP); the extent of rain forest has subsequently contracted irregularly but progressively. Thus, by the Miocene the insular and tropical nature of Indo-Australia was well-established, although many details differed from today and precise information is generally lacking.",

In the absence of tectonic activity, land area during the last glacial maximum can be estimated simply by tracing the 120 m bathymetric line; all areas above that level were dry land about 18000 years ago. In Southeast Asia, the result is an entirely different map than the modern one ( Figure 1) ; Sumatra, Java, and Borneo were part of a peninsula projecting south from Asia (often referred to as Sundaland), and several large rivers flowed across the low-lying terrain (Verstappen, 1975 ).

Palynological studies at montane sites in West Java (Stuijts, 1984) , Central Sumatra (Morley, 1982; Newsome and FIenley, 1988) , and New Guinea (Walker and Flenley, 1979) generally indicate that montane vegetation zones occurred much lower than currently. Available sites show depression of 200-1700 m, with the extent of depression increasing with elevation. This implies temperatures from about 2-6 \u2022C lower than today, and also implies that the adiabatic lapse rate (the rate at which air cools as it rises) was greater than currently (0.8 \u2022C/1OO m rather than the current 0.6 \u2022C/1OO m), which could be caused by lower humidity (FIenley, 1984; Morley and FIenley, 1987) . Palynological data from Yunnan Province, China, from 16000-17000 BP suggest temperatures 2.5-4 \u2022C lower than currently (Walker, 1986) . Such changes in temperature may be associated with a decrease in atmospheric CO 2 content, i.e., a reverse greenhouse effect (Shackleton et al., 1983) .",

First, in some regions the increased land area would have lessened the surface area of adjacent shallow seas, thereby decreasing evaporation and the moisture content of the monsoonal winds. With the huge continental shelf of Australia/New Guinea exposed as dry land, less moisture would be carried on the summer monsoons to the Lesser Sunda Islands, Java, and southeastern Borneo, causing an extension of the current area of seasonal forest and savannah. The South China Sea and Java Sea would have been greatly reduced in area, and summer monsoons would have carried less moisture to southern Borneo and the land areas to the west of Borneo (now beneath the South China Sea) and to southern Indochina (Figure 2 ). Winter monsoons would have carried less moisture to the Malay Peninsula, eastern Sumatra, western Borneo, and intervening land, as well as the southwestern Philippines. Compounding the effects of lessened sea surface area on evaporation was\u2022 the documented decrease in temperature, which would have reduced the rate of evaporation over water and the moisture-carrying capacity of air. This would probably have intensified the current rain-shadow effect in the Cagayan Valley of northern Luzon, and perhaps central Borneo. However, in those areas that continued to receive significant rainfall, lower temperatures would have increased effective rainfall by decreasing rates of evaporation.",

However, the large rivers that flowed across these relatively dry regions probably supported gallery forest, so that high-canopy forest habitat may have persisted in a mosaic of forest and savannah in even the driest regions. At the same time that seasonal forest expanded in some lowland areas, palynological evidence shows that montane forest shifted to lower elevations (authors cited above), perhaps covering regions many times greater than it now occupies.

Palynological studies demonstrate that these complex and diverse forests are quite sensitive and vulnerable to climatic change. Episodes of high sea level have increased the area of seawater subject to evaporation and decreased the distance of a given point of land to a source of such moisture-laden air, both contributing to increased rainfall on land. Episodes of low sea level have had the reverse effect, resulting in expansion of seasonal forest and savannah. Concurrent shifts in temperature (warm during high sea level and cool during low sea level) have contributed to major changes in vegetation.",

Increasing deforestation and fragmentation can serve only to increase the vulnerability of the rain forest's entire biota.",
