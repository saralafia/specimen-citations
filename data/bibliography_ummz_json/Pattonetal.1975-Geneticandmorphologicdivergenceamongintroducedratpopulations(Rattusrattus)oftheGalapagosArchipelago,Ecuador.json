The species is now known from seven of the 16 major islands and exhibits a wide range in both human and non-human associated habitat usages. Morphological distinctiveness of island populations was first noted by Heller in 1904, consisting of overall size and shape as well as pelage color differences. Analyses involving allozyme frequencies at 37 genetic loci, epigenetic cranial characters, and multivariate treatments of mensural characters confirm and extend these observations. The level of concordance between each analysis is extremely high; each delineates the same three groupings of islands based on overall similarity: (1) Isla Santiago-Bartolome; (2) Isla Floreana-Isabela-Pinzon-San Cristobal; and (3) Isla Santa Cruz-Baltra. An hypothesis of multiple origins best accounts for the similarity relationships between islands as each of the groupings fits a known separate period of human use activity. The initial introduction was most likely at Santiago in the late 1600's; the most recent on Baltra-Santa Cruz during World War II. Gene flow between the different island groups, past and present, is considered slight, but continual introduction of immigrants from outside source populations, particularly to Baltra, Santa Cruz, and San Crist6bal, is highly probable. Genie variability as demonstrated by allozyme analysis is quite low (mean heterozygosity = 2.85 per cent) when compared to other rodent species. The pattern of variability, however, suggests that this low level does not result from a severe founder effect, but that it is a general characteristic of the species as a whole.

The species, along with two other human commensals (house mouse, Mus musculus, and Norway rat, Rattus norvegicus), has been transported nearly the world over during the past several centuries. It is thus one of the most successful mammalian weed species, being equally adept at establishing feral as well as human associated populations. While a large body of literature has been a Contr. 190, Charles Darwin Foundation. amassed regarding epizootic, ecological, distributional, or systematic attributes of roof rats (e.g., Storer, 1962; Tomich, 1968; Malecha, 1971, 1972; Eche, 1955; Schwarz and Schwarz, 1967; and Brooks, 1966) , few studies have been concerned with the underlying genetic bases for their colonizing success. The present report views the latter from the context of patterns of genetic and morphologic variability exhibited by populations introduced into the Galapagos Islands, Ecuador. The general questions asked relate to distinguishing between genie based variability and phenotypic plasticity as fundamental to colonizing success in the species. In doing this, an attempt is made to discern the relative roles of time of immigration, interisland exchange, and current extra-island influx as determinants in the documented patterns of variability.",

Kidney and liver extracts and plasma and hemolysate fractions of blood were subjected to horizontal starch-gel electrophoresis as described by Selander, et al. (1971) . Alleles for each locus examined are designated by their mobility relative to the most common allele, which was arbitrarily set at 100. Estimates of the number of polymorphic loci per population (P) and level of heterozygosity per individual per population (H) were made by actual counts (see Soule and Yang, 1973) . The criterion for polymorphism was the .05 frequency level, but it was only applied in the case of mutant as opposed to rare alleles.

These included: total length, including tail (TL); length of tail (LT); length of hind foot (HF); height of ear (E); occipito-nasal length (ON); basilar length of Hensel (BL); zygomatic breadth (ZB); braincase breadth (BB); least interorbital constriction (IOC); rostral length (RL); rostral width (RW); diastema length (D); maxillary tooth row length (ML); width across upper molars (MW); and cranial depth (CD). Samples for both of these procedures included the same specimens used in the allozyme study as well as specimens in the collections of the California Academy of Sciences (including the Stanford University Collection) collected in the Galapagos during the period 1895 to 1906. One locality (Iguana Cove, Isla Isabela) for the latter is not represented by allozyme data. Moreover, three separate localities have been combined in the morphological analyses (Elizabeth Bay, Cartago Bay, and Cowley Bay, Isla Isabela) into a single sample (labeled Central Isabela [CI]); only the Cartago Bay specimens are represented by allozyme data. Age determination for each specimen was based on tooth wear categories similar to those used by Lidicker (1966) for Mus musculus. Only adults were included in the statistical treatments of the mensural data.",

Secondary sexual variation was examined by ANOVA for the two largest samples, but, while slight dimorphism was evident, sample size necessitated the combining of sexes in all treatments. The coefficient of variation (CV) was calculated for each character in a population sample and a mean value was determined (CV) for all characters in that sample. The latter value was then used as an overall measure of gross morphological variability. A standardized canonical coefficient, which indicates the relative weight of each character in accounting for the variation within each variate, was computed by multiplying the coefficient for each character by its pooled standard de-viation. The Mahalanobis generalized distance statistic (VD 2 ) was computed for each pair of populations and was used as a measure of phenetic similarity between groups. Finally, a stepwise discriminant function analysis was performed and permitted the determination of the relative discriminating power of each character employed. The BMD07M program (Dixon, 1974) adapted for use with the CDC 6400 computer was used for these procedures.",

These are often but erroneously equated with the European subspecies, although genetic studies (Feldman, 1926; Tomich and Kami, 1966) have shown that the basic color differences result simply from alternative alleles segregating at two non-linked autosomal loci. The phenotypes include two dorsal and two ventral colors present in three combinations: (1) black above and slaty below (= rattus); (2) agouti above and slaty below (=alexandrinus); and (3) agouti above and cream or white below (= frugivorous). We follow most recent authors (e.g., Johnson, 1946; Storer, 1962; Tomich, 1968) in agreeing that subspecific status is not warranted for these phenotypes. Heller (1904) recorded both the black form and an agouti form in the Galapagos, but did note variation in the degree of darkness on the dorsum of agouti rats. Examination of the specimens available to us has revealed the existence of all three basic phenotypes in the islands. However, these three phases do not adequately describe the range of color variation present as there are clearly two agouti dorsal patterns (bright red and dark red-brown) and two slaty ventral patterns (with and without a buff wash over grey). We therefore recognize seven color phenotypes in Galapagos populations; an array similar to that recorded for various western Pacific populations (Storer, 1962) . Frequencies for these phenotypes are given in Table 7 . The black/slaty combination is appar-ently fixed only on Santa Cruz while the agouti/cream pattern is fixed on Floreana. All other populations are polymorphic, but distinctions between them are evident. Many authors (e.g., Storer, 1962) suggest that the various agouti patterns are characteristic of older roof rat introductions while the melanistic phase is indicative of quite recent immigrations.",

The latter two methods of analysis provide almost indistinguishable results differing from that obtained by allozyme data in only two points. Specifically, Floreana (Black Beach) clusters with the Santa Cruz-Baltra group in the allozyme study but with the San Crist6bal-Isabela-Pinz6n group in the others. Secondly, the Pinzon population is strongly aligned with Tagus Cove and Wreck Bay in the allozyme study but only weakly associated with that island complex in the others.

The first hypothesis would predict either a documentable correlation between the level of population phenotypic similarity and distance between islands (resulting from gene flow along the route of migration), or a high level of differential selection producing markedly distinct island population groups. There is, however, no significant correlation between inter-island distance and similarity, as measured by any of the means employed herein. Moreover, the observed island-group relationships would not be those predicted if movement of rats from island to island followed ocean currents, which generally flow from south-east to north-west. Similarily, while different environmental conditions (and hence differing selective regimes) are present on each island, each island is unique and clusters of islands sharing similar rat populations do not necessarily share similar environments (see Bowman, 1961; Lack, 1947) .

Although the first colonists arrived on Santa Cruz about 1905, rat introductions are likely to have been more recent. Two points bear on this supposition. For one, the melanistic pelage color morph is the only one present on Santa Cruz and is nearly fixed on Baltra. This condition generally characterizes recent introductions of ship-borne roof rats throughout the Pacific (Storer, 1962) . Secondly, in 1929 the Crane Pacific Expedition visited both Academy Bay and Conway Bay on Santa Cruz yet collected only samples of native rats (Nesoryzomys darwini and N. indefessus). This date represents the last sighting of either species, and their extinction has long been linked to roof rat introductions (Brosset, 1963) . Thus, the introduction of Rattus onto Santa Cruz was not likely until sometime after 1929. Similarily, Baltra was not inhabited until the development of a U.S. Army Air Corps base during World War II. The latter would have provided excellent opportunity for roof rat introduction both on Baltra and near-by Santa Cruz.",

Baltra certainly has the greatest chance for such because of the existence of both a shipping dock and airfield. The most significant observation in the data presented here which bears on this point is the relatively high level of heterozygosity in the Baltra population. This level for the Baltra population is nearly three times the value predicted by the regression statistics (.0392 versus .0144). It is quite likely, therefore, that the higher level was produced and is maintained by a steady influx of rats from plane or ship traffic. It is also of note that the rat populations of the two other commercial centers in the islands (Wreck Bay and Academy Bay) have higher levels of heterozygosity than those predicted. It is possible, again, that such higher levels, when compared to those from islands of equal or larger size, may result from occasional immigrations.",

Exhaustive search for correlates (populalational, historical, or physiographic) with levels of variability expressed for these measurements has not been made, except by examination of their relationship to one another and of each to one extrinsic variable, island size. The latter is an obvious parameter, generally highly correlated with potential selective variables such as environmental diversity (MacArthur and Wilson, 1967) , and is thus used here only to obtain a gross feeling for the biological relevance of existing patterns of variation among the rat populations examined.",

Such low variability may result from the history of introductions in the islands (e.g., involve founder effects and/or drift) or it may be basically an inherent characteristic of the species itself. Present data tend to support the latter view. The two continental populations of Rattus rattus that have been examined electrophoretically (eastern Siberia and California) are both as low or lower in average polymorphism or heterozygosity than the typical Galapagos population. Moreover, the pattern of variability in the Galapagos samples would suggest that they are representative of the species as a whole. For example, it is unlikely that three separate invasions, each probably involving different source populations, would carry nearly the same alleles at each locus unless the overall level of geographic variation in the species was fairly uniform and the levels of intrapopulation variability nearly equal and rather low. The northern Cali-fornia population examined as a comparison in this study supports this suggestion. The variable loci are among the variable group of loci in Galapagos rats. Further, both groups of populations contain the same alleles (with one exception at the Est-3 locus) in both polymorphic and monomorphic loci.",

The biological significance of this association remains to be fully understood, but such could range from a simple direct response to effective population size (if the traits are essentially neutral) or be related to overall differences in environmental heterogeneity. It is certainly conceivable that larger islands with higher habitat diversity may trigger a character release as Galapagos Rattus encounter essentially no ecological competitors on those islands which they inhabit (i.e., native rats on those islands are now extinct).",

This is not to say, however, that low variability in genetic based systems (e.g., genie and chromosomal) is a necessary prerequisite for good colonizing ability.

These include: Isla Santiago and its satelite, Iselta Bartolome; Isla Floreana-Isla Isabela-Isla San Cristobal-Isla Pinz6n; and Isla Santa Cruz-Isla Baltra. Each of the groups corresponds to a separate period of rat introductions, approximately 100 years apart, and each quite likely originated from different source areas (Europe, western South America, and western North America, respectively).
