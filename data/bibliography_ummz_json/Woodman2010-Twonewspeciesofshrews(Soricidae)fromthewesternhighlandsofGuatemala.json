These shrews are distributed in highland regions from central Mexico to Honduras. Two broad-clawed shrews, C. goodwini and C. griseoventris, occur in southern Mexico and Guatemala and are presumed sister species whose primary distinguishing feature is the larger size of C. goodwini. In an investigation of variation within and between these 2 species, I studied characteristics of the postcranial skeleton. Statistical analyses of a variety of character suites indicate that the forelimb morphology in this group exhibits less intraspecific variation and greater interspecific variation than cranio-mandibular morphology, although most skull characters support groupings based on forelimb characters. Together, these characters define 4 distinct groups among the specimens examined. C. griseoventris is restricted to the northern highlands of Chiapas, Mexico, and C. goodwini occurs in the southern highlands of Chiapas and Guatemala.

                "text": "Recent fieldwork investigating remnant communities of small mammals in the western highlands of Guatemala has provided additional specimens of broad-clawed shrews. In attempting to better characterize C. goodwini and C. griseoventris, Woodman and Stephens (2010) used quantifiable characteristics of the forefoot to supplement traditional cranial characteristics. In addition to being able to separate C. goodwini and C. griseoventris accurately, we were consistently able to distinguish the San Crist\u00f3bal and Todos Santos populations of C. griseoventris. Characteristics of the humerus similarly distinguish C. goodwini and the Guatemalan population of C. griseoventris (the humerus of C. griseoventris from Chiapas is unknown). These and other characters have since helped to identify a 4th distinctive population of broadclawed shrews, previously believed to represent C. goodwini. Although cranio-mandibular characteristics generally support these distinctions, when used alone these traditional characters are not adequate for clearly separating the 4 groups. In this paper, I describe 2 new species of shrews from western Guatemala and show how they differ from C. goodwini and C. griseoventris based on a combination of characteristics derived from the skull and the postcranial skeleton. This work underscores the utility of postcranial elements in evaluating species diversity among small mammals.",

Skull measurements follow those described and illustrated by Woodman and Timm (1993) . Skulls and humeri were measured to the nearest 0.1 mm using digital calipers or an ocular micrometer in a dissection microscope. External measurements are from specimen labels or original field notes of collectors. Length of the head and body was determined by subtracting tail length from total length. Abbreviations used for external and cranial measurements are provided in Table 1 . Dimensions of bones of the forefoot follow those described and figured by Woodman and Morgan (2005) and Woodman and Stephens (2010) . The term ray refers to the portions of the manus associated with a metacarpal and its respective phalanges, and digit is that part of the ray associated with the phalanges alone. Bones of ray III were measured from X-ray images of traditional dried skins, produced with a digital X-ray system in the Division of Fishes, Department of Vertebrate Zoology, National Museum of Natural History, Washington, District of Columbia. Images were transferred to Adobe Photoshop CS3 (version 10.0.1; Adobe, San Jose, California), where they were trimmed and converted to positive images. Individual bones were measured using the custom Measurement Scale in the Analysis menu. Only measurements from ray III were used in this study, because ray III shows the greatest variation among groups (Woodman and Morgan 2005; Woodman and Stephens 2010) . All ray III measurements were rounded to the nearest 0.01 mm and are presented with their respective abbreviations in Table 2 . Capitalized color terms are those of Ridgway (1912) . Capitalized vegetational associations are from the Holdridge classification of life zones (Holdridge 1947 ; Ministerio de Agricultura, Ganader\u00eda y Alimentaci\u00f3n 2001) . Threat of frost comes from Tamasiunas et al. (2002) . Following the ruling of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (2006) , the genus Cryptotis is herein treated as masculine.",

The 2 species were known to differ in average size, and this size difference is reflected in a plot of condylobasal length (CBL) against breadth across M2s (M2B; Fig. 1 ). In general, specimens identified as species A group with C. griseoventris, and those labeled species B plot with C. goodwini. However, species B tends to have a distinctly narrower palate at a given CBL than typical C. goodwini. Although the 2 species group separately when their identities are known, one would not predict a priori that 2 species were represented in their combined plot. To study the characters of the cranium more comprehensively, I carried out a principal components analysis on 10 cranial variables. A plot of resulting factor scores on the first 2 factor axes ( Fig. 2) confirms the difference in average cranial size between C. goodwini and C. griseoventris. In this plot, factor 1 represents overall size (Table 3) and factor 2 is a contrast between UTR and several variables representing cranial width (PO, M2B, U3B, and U1B). The combined set of C. griseoventris and species A separate from C. goodwini and species B along factor 1 with little overlap, again confirming the difference in size among these populations. Along factor 2 C. griseoventris overlaps considerably with species A, and C. Table 3 ).",

In both cases the overlap between the pairs of species is incomplete, and the individuals of each maintain a sense of cohesion. The slight differences reflect the tendencies of Mexican C. griseoventris and species B to have narrower skulls and longer unicuspid rows than species A and C. goodwini, respectively. Variables measured from the forefeet of these shrews further distinguish the 4 populations. Lengths of the metacarpals, proximal phalanges, and middle phalanges overlap broadly among groups, and in some cases the means are the same or nearly so ( Table 2 ). The widths of these 3 bones, however, differ consistently among populations. The bones of the forefoot of C. griseoventris are the narrowest, those of species A are intermediate, and those of C. goodwini and species B are the widest (Figs. 3 and 4 ). The ranges of measurements among these 3 groupings (with C. goodwini and species B treated as a single group in this analysis) show little or no overlap. Both length and width of the distal phalanges exhibit similar patterns: the distal phalanges of C. griseoventris are the shortest and narrowest, followed sequentially by species A, species B, and C. goodwini. When both dimensions of the distal phalanx are plotted ( Fig. 5 ), C. griseoventris, species A, and C. goodwini show no overlap. However, species B overlaps with larger individuals of species A and smaller individuals of C. goodwini.",

A plot of factor scores on the first 2 factor axes ( axis represents overall size of ray III (Table 4 ). The 2nd factor axis primarily represents the lengths of the proximal phalanx (PPL) and metacarpal (ML). Both variables are negatively weighted, however, so their values decrease as factor 2 increases (Table 4 ). The distributions of the populations on this plot ( Fig. 6 ) evidence a generalized trend of decreasing PPL and ML (factor 2) with increasing multivariate size of ray III (factor 1) among the 4 populations (i.e., across groups). The distribution of individuals within each of the 4 populations (i.e., within groups), however, exhibits the opposite tendency of increasing PPL and ML with size of ray III. Some of the separation of groups shown on this plot is explainable by proportional differences in bones among species. C. griseoventris and species A, for example, have the same mean ML (Table 4) , but different mean PPL. The same pattern is true for C. goodwini and species B. These tendencies and patterns confirm that individual characteristics of the manus have evolved independently among the 4 populations.",

Goldman from 25 December 1895 through 2 January 1896, in the vicinity of Todos Santos Cuchumat\u00e1n. Goldman (1951:295) notes, ''Most of our work was done on the upper part of a spur-like ridge lying immediately back of the town, where patches of the original forest made up of giant cypresses, firs, and pines had been left. Elsewhere about Todos Santos the slopes had been deforested in many places to make room for wheat and corn Although some of these items may be incidental occurrences, the presence of earthworms is common to all 3 specimens, suggesting that oligochaetes are an important part of the diet of C. mam. Oligochaetes comprised the largest contribution (8% of prey items; present in 73% of 55 shrews sampled) in the diet of Cryptotis meridensis, another large-bodied shrew inhabiting high elevations in the Andes of Venezuela (D\u00edaz de Pascual and de Ascen\u00e7\u00e3o 2000). In multispecies communities of shrews, earthworms tend to be consumed only by larger species (mean adult HB ! 76- Churchfield et al. 1999; Churchfield and Sheftel 1994) .",

Capture records of C. lacertosus indicate that it commonly occurs in communities of small mammals numerically dominated by Peromyscus guatemalensis. Recorded diversity in these communities ranges from 6 to 11 species. Other small mammals that commonly are found with C. lacertosus include Habromys lophurus, Microtus guatemalensis, Peromyscus beatae, Reithrodontomys microdon, R. sumichrasti, R. tenuirostris, and Sorex veraepacis. Sciurus deppei and Peromyscus mayensis also may occur. Reproductive biology of C. lacertosus is mostly unknown. None of 3 females captured in July and December 2005 was pregnant or otherwise showed evidence of reproductive activity.",

C. mam is the 2nd most abundant species represented. Other species include Habromys lophurus, Peromyscus guatemalensis, P. beatae, P. mexicanus, Reithrodontomys microdon, R. sumichrasti, R. tenuirostris, Sorex saussurei, and S. veraepacis. At other localities where C. mam has been captured, the small mammal communities are less diverse (5-7 species). R. sumichrasti is the most common species in these faunas, and C. mam is relatively uncommon. M. guatemalensis and P. beatae are often present, and Sylvilagus floridanus, Sciurus aureogaster, H. lophurus, Neotoma mexicana, P. guatemalensis, Reithrodontomys mexicanus, R. microdon, R. tenuirostris, Sigmodon toltecus, and S. veraepacis are occasionally present. Reproductive biology of C. mam is mostly unknown. None of 4 females captured in January 2008 was pregnant; a single female captured in July 2008 was lactating. The intestinal tract of a female from Laguna Magdalena (USNM 570337) contained a 2-cm-long section of an earthworm (Oligochaeta) and numerous setae; the stomach was empty (R. Eckerlin, Northern Virginia Community College, pers. comm.). The stomach contents of a female from Aldea el Rancho (USNM 570313) included macerated plant matter (including vessel cells of angiosperms), broken insect legs, and setae of earthworms, and the intestine contained macerated insect parts and an approximately 4-mm-long piece of down from a passeriform bird. The stomach of a second female from that locality (USNM 570314) contained several pieces of an approximately 2-mmdiameter oligochaete. The intestine included parts of beetles (Coleoptera), a few plant cells, and some fungal hyphae (R. Eckerlin, Northern Virginia Community College, pers. comm.).",
