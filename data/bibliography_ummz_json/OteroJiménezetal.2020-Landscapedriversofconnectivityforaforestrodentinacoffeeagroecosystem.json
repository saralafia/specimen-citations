We used 12 microsatellite markers to calculate individual-based estimates of gene flow as a measure of dispersal. We used resistance surface modelling, using Resis-tanceGA (Peterman in Methods Ecol Evol 9:1638 -1647 , 2018 to identify if any of the landscape features analyzed explained the patterns of gene flow. Results Our results showed patterns of population structure and weak isolation-by-distance, as found previously for H. d. goldmani by Otero Jim\u00e9nez et al. (Conserv Genet 19:495-499, 2018) . Slope and tree cover were the two landscape features that could best explain gene flow patterns. More specifically, intermediate slopes and tree cover represent the lowest resistance to gene flow for H. d. goldmani and, thus, have a role in promoting gene flow in this species. Conclusion This study highlights the potential of integrating molecular and landscape data to explore population connectivity of elusive species, such as terrestrial small mammals. Our study adds to the growing body of literature in landscape genetics by demonstrating that a rodent species shows population structure at a small scale resulting from landscape factors linked to agricultural management.",

However, within the agricultural matrix we can find management practices that vary greatly in the level of intensification, from high crop diversity and low external inputs (e.g., organic or traditional production) to systems with a single crop species and increased use of external inputs (i.e., pesticides, herbicides; Perfecto et al. 2010 ). Because of this variation in management, we do not expect all agricultural lands to influence species movement equally. By identifying which agricultural practices facilitate dispersal we can maintain productive landscapes while also preventing species extinctions. However, few studies have evaluated the effect of different management practices on species dispersal at a fine scale (for an example see Flores-Manzanero et al. 2018) .",

(2018) found limitations to gene flow within a coffee agroecosystem composed of forest fragments and farms with diverse management practices. Their results showed distinct genetic clusters that could not be explained by geographic distance between samples (i.e., isolation-by-distance). Our study builds on Otero Jim\u00e9nez et al. (2018) findings by extending the sampling of H. d. goldmani across coffee farms and by including an additional two forest fragments in an effort to identify landscape features that are restricting or promoting gene flow in this agricultural landscape. We collected genetic data from 12 microsatellite markers and land cover data derived from satellite images from five landscape features (i.e., slope, elevation, streams, riparian effect, and tree cover) to examine their influence on H. d. goldmani gene flow. We expect landscape features related to agricultural management (i.e., tree cover and riparian effect), to have a stronger effect on gene flow than topographical features (e.g., slope, elevation). More specifically, we predict proximity to rivers or streams (i.e., riparian effect) and high canopy cover to promote dispersal (i.e., gene flow) of H. d. goldmani. Otero Jim\u00e9nez et al. (2018) reported that H. d. goldmani individuals found in the high intensity coffee farm clustered along streams edges. We expect these areas to serve as refugia or corridors for the mice. These areas have higher tree cover than surrounding coffee production and can provide resources needed to survive within the farms as well as protection from predators.",

In this region, coffee is produced in a variety of ways that follow an intensification gradient (Otero-Jimenez et al. 2018; Moguel and Toledo 1999) . It is common to find several of these management practices represented in small areas. For this reason, we chose to do our study in the tropical montane region of Soconusco in Chiapas, Mexico (Fig. 1a ). This area is dominated by coffee production that varies in management intensity, ranging from rustic to unshaded monocultures with forest patches scattered between them (Fig. 1b) .",

The low intensity coffee farm was certified Smithsonian Bird Friendly\u00d2 coffee production at the time of the study ( Fig. 2c ) and is characterized by endemic shade trees and understory trees. The medium intensity farm is an organic shaded commercial polyculture coffee farm (i.e., no synthetic herbicide, pesticide or fertilizer use). Most shade trees in this farm are nitrogen fixing Inga trees that are found alongside Tabaeuia, Yucca and Ocotea species (Iverson 2015; Fig. 2b ). Additionally, there are fruit trees such as guava and avocado throughout the farm (Iverson 2015) . The high intensity coffee farm is closest to sun coffee, dominated by intensely pruned Inga trees (Iverson 2015; Fig. 2a ). This farm also uses synthetic fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides. Farms included in the study have been producing coffee for 60-100 years. Although management practices vary over time, these farms have had similar management practices for at least the past 20 years (Perfecto and Vandermeer 2002 ).",

Ear tissue samples from H. d. goldmani were collected across a coffee agroecosystem composed of three forest fragments and the three coffee farms described earlier (Fig. 1b) . To facilitate continuous animal collection across this complex landscape we sampled an area of approximately 4 km 9 2 km ( Fig. 1b) , by placing traps in 100 m transects following roads and trails within the farms and the forest fragments, following the methodology of Otero Jim\u00e9nez et al. (2018) . Two Sherman traps were placed every 10 m at the base of a tree or log on either side of the transect line. Transects were moved every night within the farms or forest fragments. While equal trapping effort was put into each of the areas sampled (i.e., 3 forest fragments and 3 coffee farms), we were not able to obtain ideal continuous sampling. Ear tissue samples were preserved in 20% DMSO buffer saturated with NaCl at room temperature until extraction (i.e., 1-8 weeks). Mice were captured using 22.9 cm 9 7.6 cm 9 8.9 cm Sherman live traps.

Bonferroni corrections were applied to determine significance of HWE and linkage results. We estimated relatedness (r) within and between sites to check that individuals sampled were not siblings.

Slope and elevation are the most common variables analyzed in landscape resistance analysis (Zeller et al. 2012) and are known to influence connectivity. Rivers and streams have been known to serve as barriers to movement for small mammals (Savidge 1973; Wolff 1999; Bohdal et al. 2016) . Tree cover and riparian effects are the two agricultural management related features in our study. High tree cover has been linked to increased species richness and density of small mammals (Munshi-South et al. 2016; Caudill and Rice 2016). We included riparian effect (i.e., distance from stream) because these areas are usually steeper and tend to be unmanaged in the farms, potentially serving as important corridors or habitat for wildlife. Landscape features were quantified using products derived from Google Earth aerial imagery and a 20 m resolution digital elevation model (DEM). Land cover was digitized manually using the heads-up digitizing method (Bolstad 2016) to map polygons of similar levels of tree cover discernable at a 1:2000 scale. Land cover was classified using a scale from 1 to 6 which corresponds to the amount of tree cover, not taking into account species identity: (1) no high vegetation cover (open), (2) sun coffee plantation (no tree cover), (3) 25% tree cover coffee plantation, (4) 50% tree cover coffee plantation, (5) 75% tree cover coffee plantation, and (6) 100% tree cover (Fig. S1 ). Slope and elevation layers were developed from the DEM using appropriate geoprocessing tools (Fig. S1 ). Streams were delineated from the DEM by calculating flow accumulation and classifying any cells above a value of 100 as a stream including only streams that have water flow year round (Fig. S1) . The flow accumulation is the calculation of upstream area for every raster cell in our analysis area (Jenson and Domingue 1988) . This calculation does not account for seasonality in water levels. We created the riparian effect layer by calculating a n Euclidean distance raster from stream locations, which we used to represent lower resistance with closer proximity to a stream (Fig. S1 ). Digitization and DEM raster processing was performed with ArcGIS 10.3.1 (ESRI 2015).",

We used the method developed by Peterman et al. (2014) to optimize our resistance surfaces to address concerns of analyses based on expert opinion. For example, many studies using expert opinion to develop landscape resistance models treat expert opinion as empirical data, when it is not, thus making it difficult to evaluate performance (Zeller et al. 2012) . In general, it is difficult to describe accurately the ecological processes being modelled in resistance analyses, and even if the processes are known, there is no guarantee that they will have significant influence on gene flow (Peterman 2018) . Peterman et al.'s (2014) optimization approach relies on a genetic algorithm to explore the parameter space, which seeks to maximize the relationship between pairwise landscape resistance distances (i.e., landscape variables) and pairwise genetic distances without any a priori assumptions (Peterman 2018) . The optimization was done using the R package ResistanceGA (Peterman 2018) . Landscape surfaces were optimized in two steps: (1) single resistance surface optimization, and (2) combined (i.e., multi-) surface optimization (Fig. S1 ). For the first step we optimized each landscape surface independently, using the commuteDistance function exploring resistance values up to 2500 using an 8 neighbor joining scheme to measure connectivity (Fig. S1) . The com-muteDistance function, which calculates the commute distance or the time it takes for an individual to move from point a to point b in a particular landscape (van Etten 2017). Our dependent variable was genetic distance measured as a r (Rousset 2000) , calculated using Genepop (Rousset 2008) , and our predictor variables were the landscape resistance values. If more than one H. d. goldmani individual was sampled within the 20 m 9 20 m area, a single H. d. goldmani sample was randomly selected for this analysis. For continuous landscape variables (i.e., slope, elevation and riparian effect) we tested nine possible transformations for the resistance relationship between both variables (i.e., linear, monomolecular, reverse monomolecular, inverse monomolecular, inverse-reverse monomolecular, Ricker, reverse Ricker, inverse Ricker, inverse-reverse Ricker). Additionally, we included pair-wise geographic distance of samples as our null model. We conducted three independent optimization runs for each of the landscape variables to ensure results were robust.",

For the next optimization step, we chose to perform a combined surface optimization analysis with a single combined surface of slope and tree cover, along with all other single surface variables. Because tree cover (TC), streams (STR) and riparian effect (RE) had strong correlations with each other we only created a single combined surface of S ? TC. The lower correlation between tree cover and slope could be explained by the differences in management practices between the medium and high intensity coffee farms. Steeper areas in the medium intensity coffee farm are more likely to be left unmanaged, while in the high intensity farm steeper areas are included in coffee production. Results showed the combined surface to be the best supported model at 45.51%, followed by slope (21.76%; AIC = -13,069.23) and tree cover (13.55%; AIC = -13,069.43; Table 3 ).",

Our results examining population structure with an increased sample size (from n = 136 Otero Jim\u00e9nez et al. 2018 to n = 165 this study) confirmed earlier patterns including a weak but significant increase in genetic differentiation with increasing geographic distance between individuals. Of the five landscape variables sampled, slope is the one with the strongest influence on genetic distance, followed by tree cover. The permeability of areas with higher slopes can vary in the landscape with the level of management intensity. We found that intermediate slopes (i.e., 30-40% slope) had the lowest levels of resistance for Heteromys with increasing resistance at the two extremes. This could be due to the fact that flat (low slope) areas are used for coffee production and the mice are not able to disperse as easily through this landscape. However, as slope increases, harvesting and management of coffee is more difficult and the land is not as intensely managed, creating a better environment for the mice until it reaches a certain threshold where it becomes too steep for mice to disperse readily. We found that our results are supported by studies done on other mammal species, where slope was an important predictor for richness and density (Carver 2010; Russo et al. 2016; Keeley et al. 2016 ).",

The Caudill and Rice (2016) study on rodent diversity in a similar coffee system highlighted the importance of canopy cover for rodent species richness and density. In addition, higher tree cover could be correlated to higher food resource availability (i.e., seeds) for H. d. goldmani, which could be a factor driving the higher gene flow in areas with 50-75% tree cover. One reason why landscape resistance might be higher in areas with 100% tree cover, could be that a slightly more open canopy allows for more diversity of understory plant species increasing availability of food resources for Heteromys",

It is not clear what could be driving these patterns. One reason could be the absence of samples near or within these areas. Integrating samples from rodents in these open areas would increase our understanding the influence of this areas to gene flow. Consistent with other studies, our findings suggest that tree cover is essential for maintaining rodent population connectivity in agroecosystems. We expected riparian effect to be one of the main variables explaining gene flow. Our results generally support our prediction, with riparian effect ranking as the third or fourth best supported model. However, the streams layer performed similarly well, suggesting that areas near streams (riparian effect) and streams facilitate Heteromys gene flow. This pattern is opposite to what we expected and may be due to the spatial scale of the surfaces (20 m 9 20 m) being too large to capture the influences of streams on Heteromys dispersal. As a consequence, both the riparian vegetation and stream layer may be representing use of areas near streams as dispersal corridors. These results could also be linked to resource availability. There is a higher diversity of vegetation (i.e., non-coffee plants) found near streams and, thus, these areas may provide important food sources for Heteromys.",

Our study had several limitations that could have influenced the strength of the patterns observed. One of these limitations was sampling; we worked within active coffee farms and in a highly mountainous region where certain areas were inaccessible for trapping, thus limiting our ability to achieve continuous sampling. In addition, sampling in areas with little to no tree cover resulted in very low to no trap success. This pattern could mean that Heteromys does not use regions of low tree cover or that it exists at very low density and trapping effort was not sufficient. Secondly, our landscape data were limited in grain by the resolution of the satellite images and the digital elevation model used, which was 20 m 9 20 m at its finest. Studies have demonstrated the importance of spatial scale in determining the relationship between landscape variables and population structure (Zeller et al. 2012; Oyler-McCance et al. 2013) . Since our project examined rodent populations a finer resolution of landscape features would have been preferable, however, because 20 m is still smaller than the estimated home range of Heteromys, this scale was able to provide some valuable insight. We hope that with technological advancements collecting these data at finer scales will become more affordable and accessible in the near future. We expect that with finer scale data we will find stronger relationships between the landscape variables analyzed and the genetic structure of Heteromys.",

Our findings add important insights to the literature on tropical rodents and their responses to anthropogenic land use changes.
