Many of the studies on which the currently accepted taxonomy is based (see Hall, 1981) were restricted to small geographicareas, few taxa, and, all too often, small sample sizes. In the course of studies of revolution of pocket gophers of the genus Geomys and their lice (Timm, 1979), it became apparent that a comprehensive review of morphological variation and taxonomy of this genus, especially the widespread, diverse populations referred to the species Geomys bursarius, was much needed. We began such an investigation, and early in the study our attention focused on the northern and central portions of the area in which G. bursarius occurs, partly because of the obvious need for work, and partly because other studies were in progress in New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas (Baker and Genoways, 1975 ; Honeycutt and Schmidly, 1979; Tucker and Schmidly, 1981 ; Bohlin and Zimmerman, 1982) .",

Because the two species included in Diplostoma are now known to be junior synonyms of Mus bursarius, which Rafinesque included in the genus Geomys, Diplostoma is now considered to be a junior synonym of Geomys. Although some controversy remains over the species to which the name Mus bursarius was applied (see Merriam, 1895), current usage and relative certainty about the proper allocation of the name suggest that the name bursarius should continue to be applied as it has been since the mid-1800's.",

The G. bursarius group was monotypic as he defined it; he noted a variety of features distinguishing it from the other groups, including an elongate and angular skull, high sagittal crest, and palatine bones with ascending wings broadly articulated with the horizontal shelf of the orbitosphenoids. Finally, the texensis-breviceps group included five species: arenarius, breviceps, lutescens, personatus, and texensis. He considered all five to be closely related, and probably much like the stock that gave rise to the G. tuza (=pinetis) and G. bursarius groups. Merriam considered the species G. lutescens, occurring from Oklahoma north to South Dakota and Wyoming, to be the closest relative of G. breviceps. This classification was accepted for over half a century, although between 1895 and 1947, fourteen additional taxa were described, all as subspecies of either G. breviceps (llanensis, brazensis, ammophihis, dutcheri, ludemani, major, pratincolus, and terricolus), G. bursarius (illinoensis and majusculus) , or G. lutescens Beginning in 1947 taxonomic changes were made which involved G. breviceps, bursarius, lutescens, and texensis. The following discussion deals only with these species: i.e., it excludes G. arenarius and personatus. Villa-R. and Hall (1947) stated that they had evidence of intergradation between all taxa that occurred in Kansas, and so considered them to represent a single species, G. bursarius. At the same time, they described a new subspecies, G. /;. industrius. Because subspecies of bursarius, lutescens, and breviceps as then defined occurred in Kansas, they implied that all taxa previously included in these species were conspecific, and Baker and Glass (1951) formally synonomized G. breviceps with G. bursarius on the basis of putative evidence of intergradation between the taxa G. breviceps dutcheri and G. bursarius major in Oklahoma.",

We feel that the data presented by Honeycutt and Schmidly ( 1979) are sufficient to support the separation of G. hitcscens and G. patterns of similarity. We then tested the null hypothesis of no difference between adjacent populations by a series of discriminant function analyses. These tests for significant differences are most meaningful when taken in the context of a geographically large area and many populations; thus, we considered approximately one-fourth of the OTUs simultaneously in each of four analyses as described below.

Because discriminant function analysis is a powerful discriminator, spurious results may be obtained if the predetermined groups are not defined correctly. For example, two small (n less than 50) samples drawn from a single population may be significantly discriminated in many cases because of random differences due to sampling error. However, the significance levels drop with the addition of more individuals and/ or groups. Experimentation has shown us that addition of an \"outgroup,\" i.e., a population known to be different, usually will cause spurious discrimination to drop below the level of statistical significance, and for classification functions to show great overlap between spurious or artificial groupings. The results described below show that, when samples of pocket gophers drawn from broad geographic areas are analyzed simultaneously, many groups are not distinguishable, in spite of the strong discriminatory power of the algorithm. However, some groups are easily distinguished at high significance levels, demonstrating that the discriminatory power of the algorithm does not break down when large numbers of groups (up to 20) are considered simultaneously. Thus, one can test the hypothesis of distinctness of each and all populations of a taxonomic unit. Use of the discriminant function analysis has the advantage of allowing multivariate comparison of identified groups (populations) rather than individuals; this capacity is not available in other analyses.",

Multivariate analyses were conducted using programs in the BMDP series (Dixon, 1975) and MIDAS, the University of Michigan data analysis system; those used were the cluster ( MIDAS CLUSTER); principal components analysis (MIDAS PRINCOM); and stepwise discriminant function analysis (BMDP7M). Cluster analysis was conducted using data generated by the principal components analysis. Data entered for each OTU were the scores on the first seven axes. Because the subsequent axes were not statistically significant, and accounted for less than 2% of the total variation, they would not have added meaningful information to the cluster analysis. This method limits the importance of size to 1/n of the total \"characters,\" where n = number of axes. Use of unmodified data can allow size to play an excessive role in clustering. The cluster method used was an unweighted pair-group sum of squares utilizing the variance-covariance matrix. The cluster analysis of OTL T s was used as a basis for detecting geographic patterns of similarity ( Fig. 4 ). To construct this figure, the cluster phenogram (which had amalgamation distances of 0.412 to 36.361) was examined for identifiable geographic groupings at amalgamation levels of 5.0, 10.0, 15.0, 20.0, 25.0, and 30.0. Below the 10.0 level most groupings did not involve geographic neighbors, but at 10.0 a geographic pattern was evident; this is indicated on Fig. 4 by the inner ( thinnest) line. Level 15.0 indicated further major groupings, and is shown as the middle line. Level 20.0 is the outer (heaviest) line in Fig. 4 . Level 25.0 simply grouped OTLT 66 to its neighbors, and so is not shown.",

Size large for genus; adult females averaging head and body length and condylobasal length from 170 mm and 44.4 mm (in northwestern Wisconsin) to 210 mm and 50.5 mm (in northeastern Iowa), respectively (Fig. 3 ). Skull large, robust ( Fig. 2A ); zygomata broad, widely divergent anteriorly; sagittal crest narrow and usually high; rostrum long (both relatively and absolutely); frontal-premaxillary suture on dorsum falling anterior to or reaching (not exceeding) a line drawn between the anterior-most points in the orbits; mastoid processes long, projecting at an angle approximately 20\u00b0from horizontal; braincase oval; naso-frontal region usually domed slightly; anterior root of zygomatic arches sloping back strongly. Face of upper incisors strongly bisulcate; minor sulcus fine and close to inner edge of tooth; principal sulcus much deeper and wider, and lying on or slightly external to median line; enamel face rounded externally and between sulci. Incisors procumbent. Upper premolar bilobate, curved, sloping forward basally, and concave anteriorly; last molar curving backwards basally, and concave 33.9 to 44.3% length of head and body), and having brown rather than slate-gray (\"melanistic\") fur in most individuals. Differs from G. bursarius loisconsinensis in having a proportionately shorter tail and in having the anterior portion of the frontals forming a rectangle rather than a square ( Jackson, 1961 ) .",

In this region there is an abrupt change from less than 44 mm to greater than 46 mm; only a single population in southeastern Kansas is intermediate. Single specimens that were not included in the OTU means indicate that the clinal discontinuity is clearly no more than 30 km wide, and is narrower in many places. The detailed nature of the discontinuity has been studied in two areas. In Antelope County, Nebraska, the change in size is extremely abrupt, with a change from 42 mm to 47 mm taking place over a distance of about 2 km (Heaney, 1979, and data reported below). In northeastern Kansas, the width is less certain, but is less than 30 km and perhaps as little as 10 km ( Hendrickson, 1972) . In both of these areas, and apparently throughout the region of the size discontinuity, there is an abrupt change in dominant vegetation from tall-grass Fig. 3. -Map of the central and northern Great Plains showing geographic variation in mean condylobasal length ( in mm ) of adult female Geomys; scale as in Fig. 1 .",

A correlation between coat color and soil color has been previously documented in Geomys ( Hendrickson, 1972) , and we feel that this variation, and other, less dramatic color variation in the species elsewhere, is probably the result of local adaptation and carries little or no information about gene flow. Because we did not find concordant differentiation in cranial morphology, and in fact have evidence of broad clines in morphology, we have chosen to follow Jones ( 1964 ) in recognizing a single subspecies of pocket gopher (lutescens) in the western portion of Nebraska and adjacent areas. Jones ( 1964 ) suggested that a broad zone of intergradation between bursarius and lutescens exists in Adams, Antelope, Boyd, Buffalo, Harlan, Holt, Kearney, and Webster counties on the basis of east-west clines in color and size; cranial morphology was not considered. He be-lieved that the zone of intergradation widened towards the south, especially south of the Platte River. Lack of intergradation in Kansas, as was demonstrated above, puts his observation in doubt, and Fig. 3 shows that the size cline is discontinuous. We tested for intergradation in Nebraska by running a second discriminant function analysis in which all specimens from the abovenamed counties, plus those from Franklin and Wheeler counties, were entered as unknowns for comparison with a group of G. bursarius and of G. lutescens, each composed of all specimens of the respective taxa from outside the putative zone of intergradation.",

In the Payne to Grady counties contact zone, interdigitation of soil and vegetation types creates an extremely complex pattern. In spite of this, affinity of the two taxa to their usual soil type is moderately strong, with G. /. major nearly always found in or near extensive sandy soils and G. breviceps in or near darker soil that supports some trees, as well as tall-grass prairie. The zone of contact meanders due to interdigitation of soils, but where specimens are available, the potential zone of introgression appears to be no more than five miles wide, and may be much less.

The earliest records of the G. bursarius complex are from the Yarmouthian of Ellsworth County, Kansas (Hibbard et al, 1978) . We suggest that the ancestors of the two major clades in the G. bursarius complex, the breviceps group (including att water i, arenarius, personatus, and tropicalis), and the bursarius group (bursarius and lutescens), split during the Kansan glaciation, with the breviceps group speciating during some uncertain later time. The split between G. bursarius and G. lutescens probably occurred during the Illinoian glaciation when glacial advances, and probably forest expansion, were at a maximum. The subsequent interglacial, the Sangamonian, was most likely a period of some expansion for the prairie (or savannah) flora and fauna, and Geomys were recorded from Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, and Texas during this period (Hibbard, 1970; Russell, 1968) . We suggest that during the Sangamonian, approximately 200,000 years BP, Geomys spread to most regions it currently occupies. During the subsequent stage of glaciation, the Wisconsinan, many of the populations of pocket gophers were isolated as forest and glaciers advanced; most must have become extinct as their habitat was reduced.",

I. major in Texas; detailed studies of Wisconsinan gophers from these areas and of their associated faunas may yield sufficient information to evaluate this hypothesis.

In the southern part of the state the line lies well to the east of the border of tall-grass prairie, and in the northern part of the state, especially near the Nebraska border, the line lies to the west of the limit of tall-grass prairie, but in all cases the line defines the distribution of the gophers.We plotted all known localities of Geomys in Nebraska on the map of natural vegetation prepared by Kaul (1975) . All records of POCKET GOPHERS OF THE GENUS GEOMYS 55 G. lutescens lie in mixed, sandhills, or short-grass prairie. Most records of G. bursarius are from areas having tallgrass prairie, but a few records from Adams and Knox counties are from the transition zone between mixed and tallgrass prairie. We have drawn our estimate of the boundary line between the two groups ( Fig. 1 ) based on these observations. SUMMARY Three species of pocket gophers of the genus Geomys exist in the Great Plains north of Texas. The northernmost of these, G. bursarius, consists of the widespread, variable nominate subspecies and two more restricted, less variable subspecies (G. /;. illinoensis and G. /;. wisconsinensis) . The second species, from the central plains, G. lutescens, has two subspecies within the study area (G. /. lutescens and G. /. major), and one or more extralimital subspecies. The third species, G. breviceps, is represented in the southern plains (in Oklahoma) by G. b. sagittalis, and by several subspecies outside of our study area. All species are distinguishable on the basis of cranial morphology, karyology, and ectoparasite fauna, and show minor differences in bacula. All specimens previously thought to be intergrades between the three species were reexamined and found to be clearly assignable to one species or the other, with no evidence of intergradation. Hybridization between G. bursarius and G. lutescens occurs only at a single locality in Nebraska, and introgression there is inconsequential.",

The taxonomic status of the pocket gophers, ADDENDUM Several important papers have appeared since this manuscript was accepted for publication.In the first, Honey cutt and Williams (1982) used starch-gel electrophoresis to examine intergeneric relationships within the subfamily Geomyinae. Both a cladistic analysis and a cluster analysis using similarity coefficients indicated that Geomys is one of the earliest lateral branches in the subfamily, but is generally most similar to Zygogeomys, also an early lateral branch. They suggested that Orthogeomys is the sister-group of Zygogeomys.Williams 1982 Finally, Hafner (1982) used electrophoretic and immunological data to examine relationships of the Geomyoidea. His data support the monophyly of the Geomyidae and Geomyinae. Unlike the results of Honeycutt and Williams ( 1982 ) , he found evidence for considering Pappogeomys to be the sister-group of Geomys, but in general found his data inadequate for consideration of generic or subgeneric relationships.In summary, although these studies add substantially to the perspective of this paper, they do not affect our conclusions regarding the relationships of species in the Geomys bursarius species group.Hafner, M.
