Niche evolution is poorly understood at both the macroecological and macroevolutionary scales, as niches can shift over short periods of time but appear to change more slowly over longer timescales. Although reconstructing past niches has always been a major concern for palaeontologists and evolutionary biologists, only a few recent studies have successfully determined the factors that affect niche evolution. Here, we compare the evolution of climatic niches in four main groups of terrestrial vertebrates using a modelling approach integrating both palaeontological and neontological data, and large-scale datasets that contain information on the current distributions, phylogenetic relationships and fossil records for a total of 11,465 species. By reconstructing historical shifts in geographical ranges and climatic niches, we show that niche shifts are significantly faster in endotherms (birds and mammals) than in ectotherms (squamates and amphibians). We further demonstrate that the diversity patterns of the four clades are directly affected by the rate of niche evolution, with fewer latitudinal shifts in ectotherms.",

Although niche evolution is likely to be influenced by multiple factors, the identification of such factors is difficult and debated [9] [10] [11] . Metabolic heat production (endothermy) has been proposed as a major factor that can explain differences in the evolution of climatic tolerance between groups 10 , because external temperatures directly determine the metabolic activity of ectotherms but not endotherms [12] [13] [14] . Ectotherms rely strongly on external heat sources to achieve operative body temperatures; the climatic niche of ectotherms is thus likely to be constrained by physiology because these species tend to exhibit decreased activity levels under cold conditions, which reduces the time allocated for obtaining food and mates 15, 16 . Alternatively, we hypothesize that endotherms may not be under such constraints because their body temperature is internally regulated 16, 17 . Endothermy also permits warming of the developing embryos, which increases considerably reproductive success at high latitude 15 . As a result, endotherms can tolerate a wider range of external temperatures 18 and might experience more frequent niche shifts. Here, we developed an analytical approach to compare the rates of climate niche evolution in endotherms and ectotherms based on a reconstruction of palaeo-distributions and a combination of phylogenetic data on extant species with data from the fossil record.",

We only used fossils from extant genera and ignored fully extinct clades and taxa, because of the difficulty to confidently place them in the phylogeny. We reconstructed the past climatic niches (palaeo-niches) by combining the extant species and the fossil palaeo-distributions using a comparative method that can efficiently analyse large-scale phylogenetic data while incorporating fossil information. We first reconstructed the palaeo-latitudes and palaeo-altitudes for every node of each phylogenetic tree involving each vertebrate group over the last 270 Myr (see Methods and Supplementary Fig. 1 ). To estimate past temperatures at a specific latitude and altitude, we built a present-day altitude-latitude grid of mean annual temperatures and scaled this grid with the palaeo-temperature curves [19] [20] [21] .

Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were highly significant for all possible comparisons between ectotherms and endotherms (P < 2 \u00d7 10 \u221216 ). We found similar results when only the last 5 Myr were considered and when we pruned the trees to test whether the size of the tree was affecting our results ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ; see also the 'Robustness of the results' section in the Supplementary Material). These results may be primarily explained by the following three reasons: (1) endotherms have wider climatic boundaries and distributions that cover a wider latitudinal range than ectotherms 17, 18 ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ); (2) they have higher dispersal capacities than ectotherms 25 , which allow them to cross unsuitable patches of habitat across space or time (for example, from one season to another); and (3) they warm their developing embryos and feed their offspring 15 . These three key features may imbue endotherms with a higher likelihood of survival in unstable and heterogeneous environments at higher latitudes and allow them to progressively adapt to cold and unstable climates 26 . In contrast, ectothermic species may be more constrained by their physiology and are likely to have fewer opportunities to experience new climatic conditions.",

In particular, we found higher rates of niche evolution in the avian Anseriformes and Procellariiformes orders, the mammalian Lagomorpha and Carnivora orders, the amphibian Megophryidae and Bufonidae families, and the squamate Natricidae and Elapidae families. Many of these groups originated at high latitudes, such as Lagomorpha 27 or Carnivora 28 , or were particularly diverse at high latitudes (such as Anseriformes, Procellariformes, Carnivora, Lagomorpha, Megophryidae, Bufonidae, Natricidae and Elapidae; Supplementary Fig. 5 ). In contrast, we found slower rates of niche evolution in mainly tropical groups of birds (such as Bucerotiformes and Tinamiformes), mammals (Afrosoricida and Pholidota) and squamates (Typhlopidae and Dactyloidae). Even if these results at the order and family levels reinforce our main results, it is also possible that a significant difference in the rate of niche evolution between endotherms and ectotherms was detected only by chance, given that the number of replicates is low (only two large clades of endotherms and two of ectotherms).",

For instance, the processes that led to the construction of the most famous diversity pattern, which is the latitudinal diversity gradient (that is, the decrease of species diversity from the Equator to the poles), may have been affected by the accelerated or diminished rates of niche evolution. Because latitude has been shown to be largely correlated with temperature, we expect to find that the mean latitude preferences of ectothermic species has been slowly evolving. Based on the phylogenetic and fossil information, our ancestral reconstruction suggests that latitudinal shifts have been ~5 times slower in ectothermic species (amphibians: 0.15 (0.14; 0.15)\u00b0 of latitude per Myr; squamates: 0.23 (0.21; 0.24)\u00b0 of latitude per Myr) than in endothermic species (birds: 1.14 (1.10; 1.17)\u00b0 of latitude per Myr; mammals: 0.88 (0.85; 0.92)\u00b0 of latitude per Myr). Our reconstruction results also suggest that the latitudinal diversity gradient emerged first in ectotherms (~50 Myr ago for squamates and amphibians, consistent with the age found in other ectotherm groups 30 ) and more recently in endotherms (~20 Myr ago for mammals and birds) ( Fig. 2) .",

Ultimately, this contraction may have led to the accumulation of species in the tropics. To test this hypothesis, we compared the direction of dispersal of each branch of the phylogenetic tree (towards the Equator or towards the poles; from the ancestor to the descendant) during the Cretaceous period and the Cenozoic era ( Fig. 3) . We found that the distributions of all groups benefited from the higher global temperatures and mostly expanded from the tropics towards the poles during the Cretaceous period and at the beginning of the Cenozoic era. For birds, mammals and squamates, these 'out of the tropics' dispersal events lasted until the Eocene/Oligocene transition 33.9 Myr ago, which corresponded to a major cooling event that was associated with the formation of permanent ice sheets on Antarctica. Consistent with previous reports [26] [27] [28] [31] [32] [33] , we found that lineages distributed at high latitudes dispersed towards the Equator following the contraction of tropical habitats ( Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. 11 ) from the Eocene/Oligocene transition (33.9 Myr ago) until the middle Miocene climatic optimum (~15 Myr ago). Thus, our results suggest that the contraction of the tropical biome associated with decreased temperatures at high latitudes played a major role in the construction of the current diversity pattern of the four analysed groups during the second part of the Cenozoic era.",

Ectotherms tended to experience fewer range shifts because they crossed the tropic lines less frequently than did endotherms (30.2%, 55%, 18.9% and 25.6% of current bird, mammal, amphibian and squamate lineages, respectively, had at least one ancestor that crossed the tropic lines). Consistently with previous literature 32, 33 , we showed that a substantial proportion of the lineages that gave rise to the species currently distributed in the tropics originated at high latitudes during the Cenozoic era (22.9%, 52.1%, 21.6% and 27.1% of tropical birds, mammals, amphibians and squamates, respectively) and then followed the contraction of the tropical biome towards the equator, suggesting that tropical niche conservatism played an important role in the emergence of the latitudinal diversity gradient of the four groups. Based on an unprecedented dataset of terrestrial vertebrate species encompassing distribution, fossil and phylogenetic data, our results strongly suggest that climatic niche evolution is slower in ectotherms. This result may be highly related to the narrow climatic tolerances 18 ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ) and the low dispersal capacities 25 previously reported for terrestrial ectothermic species. We also show that the rate of niche evolution has important consequences for the dynamics of species ranges and current biodiversity patterns because ectotherms have experienced a slower rate of latitudinal dispersal and a higher stasis in their habitat preferences. This slow rate of niche evolution will potentially affect the dynamics of ongoing and future extinctions because climate change adaptations may require the rapid evolution of climatic tolerances, particularly in species with narrow niches 34 . Finally, our results concerning the rate of niche evolution imply that current niche modelling approaches 35 that assume that niches are conserved through time 1 may be more accurate for modelling future distributions of ectothermic rather than endothermic species.",

First, we only retained the occurrences registered from direct field observations by one or several people (occurrences tagged as 'HUMAN_OBSERVATIONS' in GBIF) and occurrences from the sampling site of a specimen preserved in a collection ('PRESERVED_SPECIMEN'). We ignored the occurrences tagged as 'LITERATURE' , 'UNKNOWN' and 'MACHINE_OBSERVATION' because they are less likely to be verified by field observations. Second, we also deleted occurrences at 0\u00b0 N and 0\u00b0 E because they frequently correspond to erroneous occurrences mistyped by database users. Third, for the GBIF occurrences, we only retained coordinates with at least 4 digits, which represented the best compromise optimizing the number of occurrences (for most species) and the quality of the data. Finally, for each species, we deleted all GBIF occurrences that did not fall within the polygons of the species in the IUCN red list.

We modelled the evolution of the species altitude and latitude preferences using a Brownian motion process and jointly estimated the evolutionary rate and the ancestral values at the internal nodes of the tree. Altitude was reconstructed independently from latitude, based only on present-day data of species. Previous research has shown that fossil information can drastically improve inferences of continuous trait evolution 45 . Here, fossil information enables us to estimate information for past nodes at high absolute latitudes and infer a decrease in absolute latitude through time, which would be impossible using classic methods such as uncalibrated Brownian motion. Therefore, the approach presented in this paper provides an exceptional opportunity to reconstruct contractions of the tropical biome. Here, we integrated the available fossil information as node calibrations on ancestral states for the reconstruction of latitude. For the nodes that had available fossil information, the calibration followed a normal distribution with a mean corresponding to the weighted mean of all of the fossils assigned to that node (as detailed in the 'Fossil' section). We selected a standard deviation such that the 95% credible interval of the normal distribution had a range equivalent to the average latitudinal range observed within each species. For the nodes that did not contain fossil information, we used instead flat distributions (normal distributions with arbitrarily large standard deviation).",

Based on the mean annual temperature data provided by the WorldClim climatic layer, a 180 \u00d7 90 climatic grid was constructed. This grid depicted latitudes on the x axis from \u2212 90\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 and altitudes on the y axis from \u2212 422 m to 8,685 m. For each combination of latitude and altitude (that is, for each cell), we calculated the mean of present-day temperatures. This grid was then used to obtain the temperature corresponding to the latitude and altitude coordinates of the nodes through time. Because global temperatures have changed over time and assuming that the association between temperature and both altitude and latitude may not have changed substantially, we re-scaled all of the cells of the grid at each given node age. To do this, we first calculated the difference between the global temperature at the node age and at present time using a palaeo-temperature curve (Cenozoic period 19 and pre-Cenozoic periods 20, 21 ). We then added this temperature difference to all the cells of the altitude/latitude matrix to obtain an equivalent of the altitude/latitude matrix at the node age. The palaeo-temperature of the node was then obtained on this matrix, at the latitude and the altitude reconstructed previously (see also Supplementary Fig. 7 ).",

For each node of the phylogenetic tree, we obtained an ancestral temperature using the previously reconstructed latitudes and altitudes, the climatic grid and the node age. The rate of niche evolution was then calculated for each branch of the phylogenetic tree by measuring the temperature differences between the descendant and the ancestor of each branch. We divided this difference by the length of the branch to obtain a rate of temperature change per unit of time. We then calculated the mean and the median of all of these rates (for all the branches of the tree) for each taxonomic group and the confidence intervals around those estimates using 1,000 bootstraps. The comparison between the rates of niche evolution among the four groups is displayed in Fig. 1 . As we reconstructed niches from past and current species distribution, we acknowledge that the change in the niche detected might be due to changes in the realized niche and do not reflect an evolution of the fundamental niche. Our study is based on occurrences data and not physiological thermal tolerance data, we thus modelled here only the realized climatic niches. This realized niche may not directly represent the fundamental niche of the species, as it may also reflect factors other than thermal tolerances, such as dispersal or competition 50, 51 .",

The boxes represent the median, the first quartile and the third quartile of the niche evolution rate reconstructed for all of the branches of the phylogenetic tree of each group. For each branch, the niche evolution was calculated as the difference of temperatures between the descendants and the ancestors. Based on Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, we found a significantly faster niche evolution in endotherms (birds and mammals) than in ectotherms (squamates and amphibians) (***P < 0.001). The rate of niche evolution was also significantly different between each separate group. The 5% extreme values are not shown.present (Myr) Time before present (Myr) Diversity Construction of the latitudinal diversity gradient over time between birds and mammals (endotherms) and amphibians and squamates (ectotherms). Each panel is a matrix of 180 \u00d7 270 cells depicting time before present (between 0 and 270 Myr) on the x axis and latitude on the y axis (from 90\u00b0 N to 90\u00b0 S). Each cell represents the diversity (number of species) at a given time and at a given latitude. The late increase in species richness for endotherms (left) suggests that their latitudinal diversity gradient has emerged more recently compared with that in ectotherms (right). ancestors (\u00b0) Latitude of the ancestors (\u00b0) Latitude of the ancestors (\u00b0) Latitude of the ancestors (",
