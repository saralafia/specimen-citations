                "text": "In Palo Alto, California, early on the morning of January 15, a gray squirrel (Sciurus griseus nigripes) dashed across a wet pavement, followed by a large house cat. The squirrel gained the opposite side of the street but instead of climbing an available tree beside the curb, it circled the tree and a parked automobile and came out again on the pavement, where the cat captured it. The cat carried the squirrel to the lawn bya house, where I had a chance to examine it closely. It was a mangy, bedraggled squirrel with half its tail gone and lacking most of the body hair. The incident seemed to be an example of a predator functioning in a beneficial manner, by placing a diseased animal in permanent quarantine. A healthy squirrel easily could have escaped the cat.-ADoLPH MURIE, National Park Service, Omaha, Nebraska.",

The only absolute distinction found between the latter and the Diablo specimens is in the character \"width of rostrum near end\" (minimum width 4.2 mm. in berkeleyensis; maximum width 4.0 mm. in Diablo material). In each remaining character studied the 2 adult topotype skulls of berkeleyensis fall within the range of variation established by the 12 specimens from Mt, Diablo. Only average differences would allow subspecific separation of Berkeley and Mt. Diablo specimens. No large series is available, however, to permit computation of any \"average\" of the race at Berkeley; and the average differences, as established by the material at hand, are not sufficient in my opinion to warrant designation of the Diablo specimens as a distinct race.",
