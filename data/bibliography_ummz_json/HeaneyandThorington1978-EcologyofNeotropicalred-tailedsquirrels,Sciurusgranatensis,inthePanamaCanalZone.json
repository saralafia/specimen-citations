We recently conducted a study of the Neotropical red-tailed squirrel, Sciurus (Guerlinguetus) granatensis, which occurs from northern Costa Rica south to Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador (Hall and Kelson, 1959; Cabrera, 1961) . Sciurus granatensis is an inhabitant of seasonal rain forest and is a common species in diverse habitats in some areas (Enders, H132; Fleming, 1970; Handley, 1966 Handley, , 1976 . We studied S. granatensis in secondary forest (over 60 years old) on Barro Colorado Island (BC!), Panama Canal Zone, from 19 May to 11 August 1976 , and 14 December 1976 to 15 January 1977 including parts of the rainy and dry seasons. The physiography, vegetation, and mammalian fauna of BCI have been described by Eisenberg and Thorington (1973) , Foster (1973) , Kaufmann (1962) , and Knight (1975) . The study area, known as the Lutz Watershed, was described in detail in Rubinoff (1974) and Windsor (1975) .",

Gustavia fruit decreased in availability in late July, and only leaves were eaten in December and January. Dipteryx trees fruit only at the beginning of the dry season, and their nuts were not used at other times of the year. No Scheelia palms were producing fruits when the study began, but many squirrels were seen chewing on old nuts that they dug from the ground. In mid-June, as the fruit of Scheelia began to mature and become abundant and other food species became rare, the squirrels used Scheelia heavily; in late July, Scheelia fruit and nuts accounted for 68% of the feeding sessions. During December and January, few Scheelia were fruiting, and fresh Scheelia accounted for only 10-20% of the feeding sessions.

Only nuts of Scheelia (1) and Astrocaryum (3) were seen being cached terrestrially by squirrels. The nuts of these two species were the only foods consumed that have a thick and nearly impermeable seed coat, and they are probably the only squirrel foods that would not rot rapidly in the ground. Scheelia was the species cached most frequently, and was also the only species we saw squirrels digging up and eating; this occurred in early May, June, December, and January. Terrestrial caching of nuts nearly always occurred at the base of a small tree, against a buttress, or beside a Hana where it lay on the ground. The mean distance squirrels carried nuts from the parent tree was estimated at 13.9 m (N = 10, SD \u00b1 4.5). The mean time required for squirrels to carry a nut away from the parent tree, cache it, and return was 5.4 min (N = 7, SO \u00b1 2.0).",

From 1 to 15 June, 44 squirrels were sighted. Of these, 31 (14 males and 17 females) were adults, 12 (three males, three females, and six unsexed) were subadults, and one could not he aged; of those identified to age class, 72% were adult, and 28% were suhadult. From 15 to 13 July 1976,36 sightings were made. Eleven (five males and ~ix females) were adults, 14 (three males, seven females, and four unsexed) were suhadults, and 11 were not aged. Of the 25 squirrels identified to age class, 44% were adult, and 56% were subadult. Fifty-six sightings were made between 15 and 30 December 1976. Twenty-three squirrels (11 males and 12 females) were adults, 16 (four males, three females, and nine unsexed) were subadults, and 17 were unknown. Of the 39 identified during this period, 59% were adult, and 41% were subadult. The proportion of subadults in the population varied from 28% in early June when at least one litter was out of the nest, to 56% in late July, when a second litter was probably out of the nest. In late December, at the end of the nonreproductive season, 41% of the population was subadult. By averaging these three figures, we obtained a yearly mean of 42% subadults in the S. granatensis population. In all, 30 adult males and 35 adult females were seen, which suggests an even sex ratio.",

Gestation is probably 44 days, as Nixon and McClain (1975) reported for S. carolinensis, and hirths take place in February and early March. Again as in S. caru/inensis lactation probably continues for 6 to 8 weeks (Seton, 1929) , with weaning in April. Three marked females were lactating when captured in late May and June, suggesting that a second litter had already been produced. One mated again on 3 June, another on 18 July, and the third sometime in mid-July. Assuming 44 days gestation and 6 to 8 weeks lactation, breeding activity probably ends in late October, coinciding with the beginning of the period of greatest rainfall in this area. Males had scrotal testes throughout the year, but in December and probably November the scrohlm is more thickly haired than at other times.",

Adult females had home ranges averaging 0.64 ha, or about 1.5 adult females per ha. Males had larger home ranges, but accounted for about the same portion of the population as females, and so must also occur at about 1.5 per ha. Subadults occurred at variable densities, averaging about one or two per ha depending on the time of year. This totals approximately five squirrels per ha in good habitat, which is defined as those areas occupied by adult females. Because half of the study area was of low quality or unusable for squirrels, we estimated 2.5 squirrels per ha for the study area.

Considering that subadults composed about 40% of the population, we used 400 g as an approximate average weight.

Eisenberg and Thorington (1973) estimated a density of 0.2 squirrels per ha, based on sightings of unmarked animals, and a total biomass of 75 kg for the island.

Males were observed following, sniffing, and on one occasion, grooming females three or more days before the females came into heat, as reported for S. aberti by Farentinos (1972) and S. carolinensis by Thompson (1977) . One difference was the presence of a single brief (near 10 s) copulation. Thompson (1977) reported similar behavior in S. carolinensis, but most other North American tree squirrels have repeated and more lengthy copulations over a period of several hours. Another difference was male loss of interest in the female within 15 to 30 min after copulation; whereas in other species males continue to approach the female. In one of two complete chases seen, there was no dominance displayed by any male until after mating had taken place. In the other chase, dominance was established early in the mating chase, as is usual for North American tree squirrels. In one of the two chases seen in its entirety, a subordinate male was able to mate with the female while the dominant male was chasing another male. Upon his return shortly after the copulation began, the dominant male bit the mounted male in the scrotum, causing him to leap away from the female who rejected further mating attempts.",

The mesocarp of the fruit of these trees is eaten by many other species of mammals, but only agoutis and squirrels are known to cache the seeds, and agoutis were not seen caching Scheelia. Smythe (1970) suggested that plants used most heavily by large rodents on BCI produce their fruit synchronously to minimize seed predation by saturating the consumers and disperse the excess nuts through scatter-hoarding by rodents. We found no evidence that Diptenjx and Gustavia, both seasonal in fruiting, were cached by any mammal during the study. Smith (1976) suggested that the scattering of seeds of Scheelia by S. granatensis on BCI substantially reduced the level of predation on Scheelia seeds by bruchid beetles (18% damaged), in contrast to a site in Costa Rica where squirrels were rare and beetles damaged 52% of the crop. However, he found that total predation was higher on BCI than at the site in Costa Rica (81% as opposed to 62%) because of higher squirrel predation. Predator saturation is probably an energetically expensive system because the trees must satiate squirrels, agoutis, and other seed+eating predators before caching occurs, and because there is a high level of predation on the cached nuts. The abundance of young Scheelia and Astrocaryum in the study area indicates the success of the predator saturation strategy, but they probably genninated when the squirrel population was lower than now.
