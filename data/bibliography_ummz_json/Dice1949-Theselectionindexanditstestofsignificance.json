In these experiments the deer-mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) exposed to predation by owls were of two types of pelage color, one type matching more or less closely the color of the soil background in one compartment, the other type matching the soil color of the other compartment. Four mice of each of the two color types were exposed alternately in the two compartments. The degree to which the pelage colors of the presumably concealingly-colored prey animals matched their backgrounds, however, could not be made exactly the same in the two compartments. Furthermore, the pelage color of the one type of prey was usually more variable than that of the other type. In view of these sources of variation within the experiments it is desirable to measure the strength of selection separately for each color of background. No important additional information will be obtained by calculating an average selection index for the two differing colors of backgrounds.",

The trend of selection is not so consistent in those experiments by Dice where owls were the predators and deermice of several color strains were the prey. In one of the experiments where the long-eared owl was the predator, more of the presumably concealingly colored individuals were taken than of the conspicuous ones, with a resulting selection index of -.09. The deviation from an index of 0.0, however, is not significant and may well have occurred by chance. In the reverse experiment with the same bird and the same colors of mice, but on yellowish gray soil instead of on nearly white soil, the high and very significant selection index of .53 was obtained. The long-eared owl was very shy and rather erratic in its behavior and this may account in part for the difference between these two selection indexes.",
