About 3% of the traps were set in trees. There was a total of 2,286 trap-nights; the distribution by habitat type is shown in Table 1 .

All scats containing hair, and many not containing hair, were analyzed. Bone and other material was removed from the scats either by teasing apart the scat beneath a dissecting microscope, or by soaking the scats for ten to twenty-four hours in a dilute (5-7%) solution of potassium hydroxide, followed by washing and straining with a fine mesh screen. The laUer method allowed more rapid handling because it dissolved hair and other protein, but was more destructive to delicate bone fragments. Many scats containing hair also contained non-mammalian vertebrate remains, seeds, or other plant material. Three species of carnivores occur in the study area: Felis bengalensis, Paradoxurus hermaphroditus, and Viverm tangalunga (Heaney et ai., 1981; Heideman and Heaney, unpublished data) . Felis bengalensis has been reported to feed extensively on vertebrates, especially rodents, in the Philippines (Alcala and Brown, 1969; Rabor, 1955 Rabor, , 1977 . Viverra tangalunga also feeds on rodents, but has readily accepted fruit when in captivity (Alcala and Brown, 1969; Rabor, 1955 Rabor, , 1977 . Rabor (1977) reported (without supporting data) that Viverra often deposit feces along human trails, frequently upon rocks. Paradoxurus hermaphroditus is the most omnivorous of thc three species, with fruit and invertebrates often present in scats and stomach contents (Alcala and Brown, 1969; Rabor, 1955 Rabor, , 1977 . We collected scats mostly along trails; it is probable that those we examined were produced by all three species.",

Vines of many families were common. The submontane forest has been disturbed in several ways. About 10% to 25% of the forest at 840 to 1,000 m elevation had been cleared, usually in 0.5 to 4 ha patches that are either currently under cultivation or have been allowed to return to second growth. In addition, local settlers used the forest as a source of building and craft materials, folk medicines, and wild food. Our trapping sites in submontane forest typically were at least 100 m from clearings, and often were further away than that.",

In primary forest (700-920 m) we captured five species (Apomys microdon, Batomys salomonseni, Rattus everetti, Rattus exulans, and R. raltus) and recorded two others (Exilisciurus concinnus and Sundasciurus samarensis). We trapped 25 individuals in 212 trap-nights (ll.8 animals/lOO trap-nights), including two R. exulans and six R. rattus.

It could be argued that the high density of introduced Rattus in primary submontane forest on Negros reflects the disturbance of the forest by humans. Rattus rattus were most abundant on farms, but the population structure of the forest sample (equivalent proportions of adult, breeding animals) suggests that the forest was suitable habitat as well. The mossy forest area had similar or higher relative abundances of both species of Rattus and of SUlICUS, even though it was over a kilometer from any clearings or homes. Additionally, the presence of a morphologically distinct form of R. exulans in mossy forest implies a long-term, continuous existence for the population. For these reasons, we conclude that the introduced Rattus and Suncus are not dependent upon disturbed habitats.",

For example, Lim (1973) found a density of 2.63 small mammals per 100 trap-nights in lowland primary forest near Kuala Lumpur, with Rattus exulans included among the 12 species taken. Langham (1983) trapped in transects al four elevations (150 m, 450 m, 750 m, and 1,000 m) on Kedah Peak, where he obtained 6.6, 6.3, 3.8, and 3.4 animals per 100 trap-nights, and 5, 6, 7, and 4 species, respectively. Thus, our values for species richness for Biliran fall near the middle of the range for the more species-rich Malay Penninsula, while our values for abundance on Biliran and Negros fall near the high end of the range for the Malay Penninsula. We conclude that the ability of the introduced rats (and possibly house shrews) to develop large populations on Negros (and perhaps on Biliran) in submontane forest seems to be independent of the species richness of the local non-volant small mammal fauna. We have no quantitative data on mossy forest elsewhere in the Philippines, although we note that mossy forest on Mindanao was found to support large populations of native species and few commensals (Hoogstraal, 1951; Sanborn, 1952) , suggesting that our results in submontane forest might not be representative of other habitats. Investigation of more islands, with more extensive sampling, is required to further examine these hypotheses and to determine the mechanisms involved.",

                "text": "The usefulness of capture-recapture estimators in any field study will depend largely on underlying model assumptions and on how closely these assumptions approximate the actual field situation. Evaluation of estimator performance under real-world field conditions is often a difficult matter, although several approaches are possible. Perhaps the best approach involves use of the estimation method on a population with known parameters. This approach has been used to evaluate capture-recapture estimators in a few instances (Buck and Thoits, 1965; Carothers, 19730; Greenwood et aI., 1985) . In practice, however, we seldom know parameter values for any natural population of interest. A more commonly-used approach to estimator evaluation involves the use of computer simulation or analytical approximations (e.g., see Carothers, 1973b; Gilbert, 1973; Otis et ai., 1978) . This approach can be extremely useful, provided that the true field situation is adequately approximated by the simulation or analytic model. Still another approach to estimator evaluation involves the comparison of different estimators of a parameter of interest obtained from a single population (e.g., Lefebvre et aI., 1982; Nichols et aI., 1984; O'Brien et ai., 1985) . Results of these latter two approaches (computer simulation and analytic approximations; field comparison of different estimators of a single population parameter) can be especially useful when they are considered together.During the past decade, D. R. Anderson, K. P. Burnham, D. L. Otis, and G. C. White developed two innovative approaches to estimating animal density from capture-recapture data, the nested grid (Otis et ai., 1978) and the trapping web (Anderson et ai., 1983) . Both methods are conceptually sound and have been well-developed statistically. Neither method has seen much field use to date, but detailed simulation studies of both methods have been published recently (Wilson and Anderson, 1985a, 1985b) . Our objective in the present study was to apply both denSity estimation methods to a single Microtus pennsylvanicus population and to compare the resulting estimates with each other and with the simulation results of Wilson",
