                "text": "The extensive numerical and adaptive diversity of South American murid rodents (subfamily Sigmodontinae) has sparked considerable interest in studying the evolutionary history of the group. Controversies have centred on the place of origin of the subfamily, on the areas of major differentiation of its members, and on the timing of lineage diversification (see, for example, Hershkovitz, 1966a; Patterson & Pascual, 1972; Baskin, 1978; Reig, 1980; Marshall, 1979; Simpson, 1980; and Voss, 1988) . Underlying these controversies has been a deep taxonomic confusion which has contributed to difficulties in, and thereby prevention of, an understanding of true relationships within and among the defined lineages of this South American radiation. Some 45-55 genera and about 250 species (Reig, 1980 (Reig, , 1986 (Reig, , 1987 are usually recognized; these are varyingly split into seven or eight suprageneric tribes. Among these, the Akodontini constitute one of the largest, most complex, and taxonomically most poorly understood tribes. Here, we examine phylogenetic relationships among the Voss (1991a) , as well as the distribution of 'Akodon' urichi, which appears to be close to Bolomys based on the mtDNA sequence data described in the text.",

Although its range (see the map, Fig. 2 ) implies a reasonable distribution, there are fewer than 10 specimens of this genus known in collections (0. P. Pearson, pers. comm.) .

                "text": "DNA sequence was obtained for segments of the cytochrome 6 gene (cyt 6) via the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using various combinations of primers (Table 2 ; Fig. 3 ). The most common approach used was amplification of double-stranded product for the entire cyt 6 gene using primer MVZ 05 with MVZ 14, followed by single-stranded amplification of two shorter overlapping segments, using primer MVZ 05 with MVZ 04, and primer MVZ 11 with MVZ 16. The limiting primer in the single-stranded reaction was used for sequencing; additional internal sequencing primers were also used. For example, the light strand sequence could be obtained by using MVZ 05 and MVZ 11 as sequencing primers on the single-stranded product obtained with MVZ 05-MVZ 04, and using MVZ 35 (this primer worked best within the genus Akodon) or MVZ 45 (on taxa outside the genus Akodon), plus MVZ 23 as sequencing primers on the single-stranded product obtained with MVZ 11-MVZ 16. Amplification was similar to that described in Smith & Patton (1991a) , on a Techne Programmable Dri-Block PHC-1 machine, with a typical program of denaturation at 93\u00b0C for ' 2 min, annealing at 45\u00b0C for 1.5 min, and extension at 72\u00b0C for 2 min, with 32 cycles for double-stranded and 35 cycles for single-stranded amplification. Sequences were entered into BIONET (IntelliGenetics, Inc., 1988) for alignment and translation. Sequence data were analysed using several software packages. Pairwise comparisons of sequences to get distances, the number of transition and transversion differences by codon position, and the proportions of each base at each codon position were performed on an IBM compatible 386 computer using version 0.01a of the MoSy program written by Christopher A. Meacham. Maximum parsimony analyses were run on a Macintosh I1 fx computer using PAUP 3.0s (Swofford, 1991) . For each of the data sets the shortest tree was found in an heuristic search, using 100 random orders of the taxa with tree bisection-reconnection (TBR) branch swapping. When more than one tree of the shortest length was found, the strict consensus tree is presented here. A separate bootstrap run with 100 replicates was used to produce bootstrap values for the groups identified on the shortest tree. The bootstrap analyses used 10 random orders of input taxa for each bootstrap replication, except for the analysis of the transversion data, where such an approach was not feasible in terms of the amount of time required to run the analysis. This is because the transversion data set has fewer characters and less resolution; in other words, many more equivalent branching patterns that must be considered. Distance-based analyses were run on a SUN Sparc station in PHYLIP 3.4 (Felsenstein, 1991) , using DNADIST to calculate the distance between taxa using the Jukes-Cantor (Jukes & Cantor, 1969) , Kimura 2-parameter (Kimura, 1980) , and maximum likelihood models, and using the NEIGHBOR program to construct neighbour-joining trees (Saitou & Nei, 1987) . The DNAML program in PHYLIP 3.4 was used to evaluate the log likelihood values for different tree topologies, following the approach used by Kishino & Hasegawa ( 1989) . Each of the three codon positions was analysed separately in DNAML in order to take into account the differences in proportions of the four bases at the three codon positions. Six different transition/transversion ratios (20 : 1, 15 : 1, 10 : 1, 2 : 1, and 1 : 1) were tested, and the transition/transversion ratio, k, that maximized the log likelihood values was chosen for each of the three codon positions in the DNAML analyses. The same tree is not necessarily the best tree for all codon positions. Therefore, after the overall best tree was determined based on the best total log likelihood value, pairwise comparisons of trees were run in DNAML for each codon position to determine standard errors relative to the overall best tree. It is the variance which is additive. Thus, the overall standard errors were calculated by taking the square root of the sum of the standard errors squared (M. Hasegawa, pers. comm.). A tree topology differs significantly from the best tree if the 9504, confidence interval (log likelihood value f 1.96 times the standard error) does not include the log likelihood value of the best tree.",

Fewer bases were scored from two additional individuals, as follows: Chroeomys jelskii, MVZ 173084, 401 bp; Notiomys edwardsii, MVZ 163066, 291 bp. The first 401 bp of cyt 6 sequence for 39 of the individuals treated in the current analysis were reported in Smith & Patton (1991a) , and are available in GenBank (accession numbers M3569kM357 16) . The additional 400 bp sequenced for this study have been added to these original accession numbers for these individuals. The 801 bp of sequence for an additional 27 individuals are also in Genbank (accession numbers U03524-U03550), thus making available the sequences for the 41 South American taxa used in the broad scale analyses below. Sixty geographic localities were sampled for the current report, as listed above in Specimens examined. Single individuals were sequenced for 17 of these localities and two were sequenced for forty; three, four, and five individuals, respectively, were sequenced for the remaining three localities. Hierarchical levels of variation, from that within populations to that among tribes, are illustrated in Fig. 4 , using corrected sequence divergence values based on Kimura 2-parameter distances (Kimura, 1980). The maximum amount of variation within a local population was 1 .7y0 corrected sequence divergence, as illustrated in the top histogram of Fig. 4 . Individuals from the same locality were almost always most similar to each other. Geographic differentiation among sampled localities within species ranged up to 9.4% sequence divergence. Values between 5% and 10% sequence divergence were found among the geographic samples of Akodon aerosus, A. mollis, A. orophilus, and Chroeomys jelskii, all of which might in fact encompass more than one species. For example, the three highest values (8.5y0, 9.0yo, and 9.4%) were for comparisons among populations of Akodon aerosus from different valley systems on the eastern Andean slopes of Peru; these differ in karyotype and each is likely to be a distinct species (see also Smith & Patton, 1991a; Patton & Smith, 1992) . Geographic representatives of eight other species that were sampled differed by 4.1% or less. However, in no case is the geographic sampling of the species examined anywhere near complete. Thus, greater differences could still be found for some of these taxa. A reduced data set was created based on an initial parsimony analysis of the 107 individuals and 60 localities. In the reduced set, a single individual was used to represent each cluster within a species that had a bootstrap value of 95% or greater in the initial analysis. This set included 41 South American taxa (the 41 individuals are identified by asterisks in the Specimens examined), plus Mus domesticus (Bibb et al., 1981) and Rattus norvegicus (Gadaleta et al., 1989) . The matrix of percent sequence divergence based on Kimura 2-parameter distances among these 43 taxa provides the data for the remaining comparisons in Fig. 4 , and is available upon request from the senior author. The third line in Fig. 4 illustrates the extent of sequence differentiation among species within the genus Akodon, as restricted here based on phylogenetic analyses (see below). The remaining levels in the figure show other groupings relative to this restricted concept of the genus Akodon. Presumed representatives of Bolomys (including 'Akodon' urichi) are grouped closest to Akodon in terms of sequence divergence, followed by Oxymycterus and Lenoxus Thomas, 1909. A clade of genera whose distributions are limited to the central and southern Andes, as identified in the phylogenetic analyses below, is quite distinct from the genus Akodon. There is no overlap between the range of differences within Akodon and that between members of this Andean clade and Akodon. This group of distant akodontine taxa differs from Akodon almost as much as do representatives of other South American tribes of sigmodontines. The final comparison in the parallel histograms is of Akodon with the Old World murids Mus and Rattus, which together constitute the most distant outgroup in our analyses.",

Of the phyllotines, Calomys Waterhouse, 1837 and Auliscomys Osgood, 19 15 group together, but Irenomys Thomas, 1919 is separate. Of the oryzomyines, Nectomys Peters, 1861 and Oryromys Baird, 1857 group together, and Oligoryromys Bangs, 1906 is separate. In the strict consensus tree for the first of two groups of most-parsimonious trees (the island with 96 trees) ( Fig. 6A) , the akodontines do group together before members of the other tribes are added, but the node at the base of the akodontines is not strongly supported. In the strict consensus tree for the second of two groups of most-parsimonious trees (the island with 60 trees) ( Fig. 6B ), Irenomys (a phyllotine) branches out in the middle of the akodontines, and the thomasomyines join the Andean group before that group joins the other akodontines. Thus, with the data currently available, it is not possible to conclude with confidence that the tribe Akodontini is a monophyletic unit (nor, with their limited representation, the other tribes as well). Moreover, it is doubtful if additional sequence data from the cyt b gene will add to the resolution at the base of the sigmodontine radiation; it remains to be seen if other, more conservative gene sequences, might aid in this resolution.

All classes of changes were included in this analysis since saturation is less of a problem for more closely related taxa. Three members of the Andean group, 'Akodon' andinus, Chroeomys jelskii, and Geoxus valdivianus were designated as the outgroup. There were 266 phylogenetically informative characters in the parsimony analysis. Two shortest trees of length 1157 were found with 100 random orders of input of the taxa. The strict consensus of these two trees is given in Fig. 8 . The genus Akodon in a restricted sense is strongly supported in this tree, as 100% of the bootstrap runs identified this group of species as monophyletic. One group of species, including Akodon mollis, A . orophilus, A . aerosus, A . torques, A. ( = Microxus) mimus, and A . ( = Hypsimys) Siberia, was found in 84% of the bootstrap runs. This group of species primarily inhabits the forested slops of the Andes extending from Bolivia north through Peru to Ecuador (Fig. 9) . A more detailed discussion of the descriptive morphology, geographic distribution, and habitats of these, and other Peruvian taxa, is given in Patton & Smith (1993) . While this group of species appears highly corroborated, populations currently assigned to given species do not always cluster together. For example, populations of A . mollis from northern Peru form a paraphyletic association with A . torques from southeastern Peru, and neither A . aerosus nor A . orophilus are monophyletic. This group probably represents a relatively recent episode of expansion and speciation in the central Andean highlands, following sequential glacial-interglacial episodes. Resolution of their true phylogene tic relationships may be compromised both by the retention of ancestral polymorphisms and lineage sorting of mitochondria1 haplotypes.",

The group does include members of the informal boliuiensis-group of the high Andean puna grassland (see Myers et al., 1990) . However, only A . puer and A . subfuscus are strongly associated (in 960i, of the bootstrap replicates). Of the other two members of the boliviensis-group, A . juninensis is linked with A. kofordi and with A . cursor from lowland Paraguay before joining the first two members of the goup, while A . boliuiensis joins last to the above listed taxa. Beyond Akodon, Bolomys amoenus, B. lasiurus, and 'Akodon' urichi do not form a monophyletic assemblage relative to other akodontines, although the triad is outside of the genus Akodon, supporting the generic status of Bolomys (see Reig, 1987) .",

In all analyses, A. ( = Microxus) mirnus and A.

For example, the Andean andinus and olivaceus, placed in Akodon by virtually all prior authors (but see Hershkovitz, 1990b) , cannot be included in that genus based on their highly corroborated phylogenetic relationship with the Andean clade of Abrothrix, Chroeomys, and related long-clawed genera.

Our representation of this genus, as defined by Reig, is limited to the highland amoenus and lowland lasiurus. However, the sequence data, while indicating a close relationship, do not support the monophyly of these two species. Inclusion of sequence data from additional taxa from this complex may provide sufficient characters to resolve their relationships with more security. Certainly, this broader sampling will be necessary to confirm the placement of the Venezuelan urichi, usually considered a species of Akodon, within Bolomys. The inclusion of urichi as a member of this unit is somewhat surprising on distributional grounds as well (see Fig. 1 ). However, Voss (1991a) has recently allocated the eastern Ecuadoran punctulatus to Bolomys, closing an apparent latitudinal as well as habitat gap between urichi and the usual set of taxa included in this genus (Reig, 1987 ; see also the map in Fig. 1 ).",

These features make longipilis, which is the type species for the genus Abrothrix, different from other related species, which could have caused some of the past taxonomic confusion within the group. Further evidence in support of the grouping of these taxa comes from protein electrophoretic loci, which link taxa within this group, and the presence of an external parasite in common on several species in the group ( Table 5 ) . Abrothrix is certainly not closely related to Akodon (sensu stricto), and cannot be regarded as a subgenus of a more broadly defined Akodon (as per Reig, 1987: 367 , and many previous authors). Neither can Abrothrix be considered an 'oxymycterine' (sensu Hershkovitz 1966b: 86) ; it clearly has no close phylogenetic relationship with the long-nosed mice of the genus Oxymycterus. Rather, Abrothrix must be considered a genus unto itself, and the only questions that remain involve what else should be included in that generic concept. The limits of this genus now include the species longipilis (the type species for the genus), hershkovitri, illuteus, lanosus, mansoensis, and sanboni, all from central and southern Chile and adjacent Argentina (see Gallardo et Hershkovitz, 1990b: 6 ).",

They then arrived in South America, via waif dispersal across the Bolivar Trough, during a worldwide drop in sea level between 7 and 5 Myr bp. The basal stock was probably a forest form. Grazing forms evolved from that basal stock in savannah-grassland areas of Venezuela, Colombia, and the Guianas. The grassland forms were restricted to that area until about 3.5 Myr bp, at which time glacial cycles begain with their coordinated retraction of forest habitats and expansion of savannah grasslands. Sigmodontine rodents then dispersed southward through a savannah-grassland corridor along the eastern foothills of the Andes, and spread throughout the previously disjunct savannah-grasslands of Bolivia, Argentina, and Brazil. Voss (1991b) on the other hand, emphasizes the differences between the savannah mammal fauna of northern South America and that of the cerrado south of the Amazon, implying that grassland muroid faunas did not migrate readily across Amazonia.",

Comparisons were made (Table 6 ) using three different rates of change for third position transversions in cyt b. The first rate is from a data set on mammals (primarily ungulates) by Irwin et al. (1991) of 0.5% per Myr. This rate gives a mean time of divergence for species within the genus Akodon, for example, of about 7 Myr. Times for genera within the akodontine tribe are about 25 Myr, and the akodontines versus the oryzomyines average 35 Myr. These are very old divergence times, pre-dating the first fossils of the group by 20 to 30 million years (see Reig, 1987 , for a general summary of fossil akodontines). The calibration based on the ungulate data set may not be the most appropriate to use. There has been discussion in the literature as to whether the rate of DNA evolution is higher in rodents than within other mammals (see Catzeflis et al., 1992 , for a review). It may be more appropriate to use rodent comparisons for calibrating rates for the South American sigmodontines. Thus, a second approach to determining a rate of change used the date of appearance of Bolomys in the fossil record at 3.55 Myr (Reig, 1987) to date the Akodon-Bolomys split. This gives a rate nearly five times faster than the (1992, and included references) , then the rate of change would be 1.7% per Myr, closer to the estimate based on the 10.3 9.7 10.4 9.7 0.2-3.8 3.8-4.6 0.9-2.0 2.2-1 1.7 7.9-1 1.2 7.3-9.7 7.7-1 1.5 7.9-12.3 7.9-1 3.2 8.8-10.8 9. 3-11.5 8.8-10.6 1.6 3.0 1.1 5.5 6.6 6.1 6.5 6.9 7.3 7.6 7.1 7.6 7.1 0.2-2.8 2.8-3.4 0.7-1.4 1 .&8.6 2.6-8.2 5.3-7.1 0.2-8.4 5.8-9.0 5.8-9.7 6.5-7.9 6.8-8.4 6.5-7.7",
