Locally, the mountains are sufficiently humid to support small, isolated patches of Cloud Forest and Tropical Evergreen Forest (Martin, 1958). At this latitude, 23\u00b0 north, these two tropical plant formations appear to reach their limit. In recent years four faunal papers on mammals of southern Tamaulipas have appeared, each reporting certain tropical species unknown at higher latitudes (Baker, 1951; Goodwin, 1954; Hooper, 1953; de la Torre, 1954). Southern Tamaulipas appears to be of primary significance in the Gulf lowlands faunal gradient, a system extending from southern Veracruz to southern Texas. In the lowlands of eastern Mexico many of the dominant tropical American taxa reach their range limits. We seek to define the northeastern section of this gradient with regard to tropical mammal faunas, to relate it to shifts in vegetation and to indicate the relative importance of the Gomez Farias region as a faunal terminus. The Gomez FarIas region is defined as the area from 22\u00b048' to 23\u00b030' north latitude and 99\u00b0 to 99\u00b030' west longitude, or approximately the rectangle enclosed by the towns of Llera, J aumave, Ocampo and Limon.
