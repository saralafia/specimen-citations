    "abstract": "The 22 genera and 64 species of rodents (Muridae: Murinae) distributed in the Philippine Islands provide a unique opportunity to study patterns and processes of diversification in island systems. Over 90% of these rodent species are endemic to the archipelago, but the relative importance of dispersal from the mainland, dispersal within the archipelago, and in situ differentiation as explanations of this diversity remains unclear, as no phylogenetic hypothesis for these species and relevant mainland forms is currently available. Here we report the results of phylogenetic analyses of the endemic Philippine murines and a wide sampling of murine diversity from outside the archipelago, based on the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene and the nuclear-encoded IRBP exon 1. Analysis of our combined gene data set consistently identified five clades comprising endemic Philippine genera, suggesting multiple invasions of the archipelago. Molecular dating analyses using parametric and semiparametric methods suggest that colonization occurred in at least two stages, one ca. 15 Mya, and another 8 to 12 million years later, consistent with the previous recognition of \"Old\" and \"New\" endemic rodent faunas. Ancestral area analysis suggests that the Old Endemics invaded landmasses that are now part of the island of Luzon, whereas the three New Endemic clades may have colonized through either Mindanao, Luzon, or both. Further, our results suggest that most of the diversification of Philippine murines took place within the archipelago. Despite heterogeneity between nuclear and mitochondrial genes in most model parameters, combined analysis of the two data sets using both parsimony and likelihood increased phylogenetic resolution; however, the effect of data combination on support for resolved nodes was method dependent. In contrast, our results suggest that combination of mitochondrial and nuclear data to estimate relatively ancient divergence times can severely compromise those estimates, even when specific methods that account for rate heterogeneity among genes are employed.

                "text": "Studies of diversification in island archipelagos have held a central place in evolutionary biology for over 150 years and continue to be of great conceptual importance. Many current questions focus on the long-term dynamics of diversification and its impact on species richness (Whittaker, 1998; Heaney, 2000; Lomolino, 2000; Zink et al., 2000; Arbogast and Kenagy, 2001; Bermingham, 2002, 2004; Riddle and Hafner, 2004) , but the number of case studies is small, impeding development of new models (e.g., Fleischer et al., 1998; Losos and Schluter, 2000; Moritz et al., 2000; Price and Clague, 2002; Steppan et al., 2003) . In particular, testing current theories regarding the generation of species richness requires empirical studies in which there are robust phylogenies of multiple clades with reliable estimates for times of divergence events (Donoghue and Moore, 2003) . Such phylogenies, when placed in a historical geological context, provide the necessary framework to examine the relative importance of various processes potentially responsible for diversification (e.g., dispersal, vicariance, and sympatric speciation; Arbogast and Kenagy, 2001; Heaney, 2000; Zink et al., 2000) .",

                "text": "One potentially useful case study involves the murine rodents (\"rats and mice\") of the Philippine Islands. The subfamily Murinae (Rodentia: Muridae) is one of the largest in Mammalia, with over 500 species currently recognized and a native range extending from Africa and western Europe to Australia, New Guinea, and nearby Pacific islands. The phylogeny of this diverse group is poorly known, with most genera not yet placed in a rigorous phylogenetic context (Michaux and Catzeflis, 2001; lansa and Weksler, 2004; Steppan et al., 2004) . The Philippine murine fauna consists of 22 indigenous genera and 64 species (Heaney et al., 1998; Rickart et al., 2005) , over 90% of which are endemic to the archipelago. These rodents range in size from about 15 g to 2.3 kg, and occupy habitats from terrestrial burrowers that specialize in feeding on earthworms to arboreal folivores. Morphological and karyological studies summarized below have suggested that several clades of endemic murines may exist in the Philippines (Table 1 ; Musser and Heaney, 1992; Heaney and Rickart, 1990; Heaney, 2000; Rickart and Heaney, 2002; Rickart and Musser, 1993; Rickart et al., 2005) ; however, these studies did not propose rigorous phylogenies, and they had no means of estimating times of divergence. The first study to do so used mitochondrial sequences to examine phylogenetic relationships among species in the endemic genus Apomys, and concluded that diversification within this genus principally involved colonization between islands with some intraisland diversification over the past ca. 5 My (Steppan et al., 2003) . Additional studies at deeper levels of divergence promise to yield further insights into the patterns and processes of diversification for island taxa.",

Nearly all of the subaerial islands have arisen de novo from below the sea, though some are remnants of continental fragments capped by marine sediments. The islands are now in close proximity to one another (from less than 1 km to 40 to 50 km), thus allowing some interisland colonization, but many have remained isolated by deep channels, which could drastically inhibit gene flow. Further, the islands vary from large (over 100,000 sq km) to small (a few hectare), and so are nearly ideal for measuring the effects of area and isolation, gene flow and genetic differentiation, and patterns of diversification and species richness (Heaney, 1986; Heaney and Rickart 1990; Steppan et al., 2003) . The purpose of this article is threefold: (1) to infer the phylogenetic relationships among genera and selected species of Philippine murines using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences; (2) to estimate times of origin and diversification for the major clades of Philippine murines; and (3) to place this phylogeny in a historical geological context to gain insight into the origin and maintenance of murine diversity in the Philippines. Specifically, we used DNA sequences from the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene and the nuclear-encoded IRBP exon 1 to infer relationships among Philippine murine genera using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian methods. To address specific historical biogeographic hypotheses surrounding the origin of murines in the Philippines, we estimated divergence times for several clades using methods that allow for the assumption of a molecular clock to be relaxed (Thorne and Kishino, 2002; Sanderson, 2002) . The phylogenetic framework and temporal scale that we present provides a foundation to begin addressing processes of mammalian diversification in the Philippines.",

For the MP analysis, all characters were treated as unordered and equally weighted; all parsimony tree searches were heuristic with at least 20 replicates of random taxon addition followed by TBR branch swapping. To determine the best model for use in the ML and Bayesian analyses, we examined the relative fit of various models of nucleotide substitution for the cytochrome b and IRBP data separately and in combination using both hierarchical likelihood-ratio tests (hLRTs) and the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) as implemented in ModelTest 3.6 (Posada and Crandall, 1998) . Log-likelihood scores and estimated parameter values for the various models were calculated based on a neighbor-joining tree of Jukes-Cantor-corrected distances. Once the best-fit model of nucleotide substitution was chosen, we used additional comparisons (based on both hLRTs and the AIC) to evaluate whether a molecular clock could be enforced. Although the two approaches to model selection generally chose the same model, in the one case where they disagreed we performed full likelihood analyses using the model selected by the AIC for reasons outlined in Posada and Buckley (2004) . The parameters describing this best-fit model were used in a heuristic tree search using a neighbor-joining tree as a start point for TBR branch swapping as implemented in PAUP*.",

For the Bayesian analysis, we conducted five independent runs of Metropolis-coupled Markov chain Monte Carlo (with four incrementally heated chains each). For each run, we specified a model with six categories of base substitution, a F-distributed rate parameter, and a proportion of invariant sites. Uniform interval priors were assumed for all parameters except base composition, which assumed a Dirichlet prior. We decoupled parameter estimation across the data set, allowing substitution parameters to be estimated for the cytochrome b and IRBP data sets independently. Runs were allowed to proceed for 2 million generations each, and trees were sampled every 100 generations. To evaluate the burn-in for each run, we plotted the log-likelihood values against generation time for each. Based on these results, we discarded at least the first 400,000 generations (4000 trees) from each run and pooled the remaining trees to calculate estimated parameter distributions and posterior probabilities for each node. The final parameter distributions and posterior probabilities for this mixed-model analysis are based on a total of 70,000 trees. To assess consistency of nodal posterior probability estimates across the five runs, we also estimated the correlation amongst probability values from each.",

These methods differ in whether they require an explicit model of sequence evolution (Thorne et al., 1998; Thorne and Kishino, 2002; Yoder and Yang, 2000) , are nonparametric (Sanderson, 1997) , or combine parametric and nonparametric methods through a semiparametric approach (Sanderson, 2002) . Of the parametric methods, some allow rates to vary from branch to branch (Thorne and Kishino, 2002) , and others require that local rates be subjectively assigned to different parts of the tree (Yang and Yoder, 2003) .",

All PL analyses used the truncated Newton (TN) algorithm (Sanderson, 2002) with 10 random restarts and 10 subsequent perturbations. To estimate the sampling error of divergence time estimates, we constructed 100 bootstrapped data sets using the seqboot program from PHYLIP 3.6 (Felsenstein, 1993), and estimated branch lengths from each bootstrapped data set on the combined-gene likelihood topology using PAUP*. We then performed the dating analysis on each of these data sets and summarized the node statistics using the profile command in r8s.",

We used an additional minimum divergence date within murines of 6 Mya for the appearance of Otomys (Pocock, 1976) . We constrained the origin of the crown clade Myomorpha, corresponding to the split between dipodids and muroids, between 35 and 70 Mya. The minimum of this range is based on the appearance of late Eocene fossils that represent early dipodids and muroids (reviewed in Flynn et al., 1985) . The older end of this range cannot be unambiguously defined, but 70 Mya doubles the date of the first appearance of primitive muroids and has been used in other studies of rodent divergence time estimation (Steppan et al., 2004) .",

Hierarchical likelihood-ratio testing chose a model with equal base frequencies, the same transition rate, and four different transversion rates, plus a proportion of invariant sites and a gamma-distributed rate parameter (TVMef+I+F with no clock), whereas the AIC resulted in the same model as applied to the cytochrome b data (GTR+I-fT with no clock). For reasons outlined in Posada and Buckley (2004) , we conducted full-likelihood evaluation using the model chosen using the AIC (parameter values reported in Table 2 ). In general, nodes that are well supported in the separate parsimony analysis of each gene also receive high support in the likelihood analysis of that gene; however, differences resulting from analytical method are more apparent for the cytochrome b data than for IRBP (Table 3) . For both genes, likelihood bootstrap values are generally higher than those recovered under parsimony analysis; however, this pattern affects more nodes and is of greater magnitude for the cytochrome b data than the IRBP data (Table 3) . Trees resulting from separate likelihood analysis of each gene are largely congruent, but the two trees do have topological differences (results not shown); with the exception of one node describing relationships among species of Apomys, none of these conflicting nodes have strong (>75%) bootstrap support from either gene.",

However, it is also reasonable to ask whether the single-model Bayesian analysis is an appropriate comparison to a full maximum likelihood evaluation of these data. Comparing parameter estimates from the single-model Bayesian analysis and the single-model likelihood analysis reveals that only two of the maximum likelihood estimated values are marginally outside the 95% confidence interval of those calculated from the Bayesian analysis (Table 4) . Moreover, the maximum likelihood topology falls within the 95% credibility interval of trees recovered from the Bayesian analysis: the posterior probability of the ML tree is 0.2%. Thus, even though model parameter estimates differ between the two genes, these differences have relatively little effect on the resulting topology, and from a phylogenetic standpoint the combined-gene data set can be reasonably analyzed using a single substitution model. The tree resulting from a combined-data likelihood analysis (Fig. 2) is highly congruent with that resulting from the combined-data parsimony analysis, and nodes that are well supported in one analysis are also well supported in the other (Table 3) . Topologies resulting from these two analyses differ in only two nodes: (1) the position of Rattus preator, (2) the position of Archboldomys FIGURE 2.

In addition, Bayesian estimates using a prior rate of evolution based on the median of rates across taxa did not differ significantly from those that were based on a prior rate using the average rate with rodent lineages downweighted (results not shown). In contrast, divergence time estimates differed dramatically depending on whether branch lengths were based on cytochrome b, IRBP, or the combined data ( Table 5 ). The earliest divergence dates were estimated from the cytochrome b data, the most recent from IRBP, with estimates from the combined-gene data set falling somewhere between the two. An initial PL analysis using cytochrome b branch lengths resulted in a basal divergence time estimate that was unreasonably old (root node = 400 Mya); therefore, we constrained all PL estimates from cytochrome b to have a maximum root node divergence of 100 Mya (Springer et al., 2003) .

First, rate heterogeneity across sites in the cytochrome b and combined data sets is high (a = 0.444; Table 2), and variable sites are saturated for most inter-generic comparisons (results not shown). Second, the optimal PL smoothing values for cytochrome b (smoothing = 0.01) and the combined data (smoothing = 100) were considerably lower than that from IRBP alone (smoothing = 10 6 ), suggesting that cytochrome b severely violates the molecular clock among higher taxa. Likewise, the posterior distribution of the autocorrelation parameter v has a mean of 0.04 (0.02-0.07,95% credibility interval) for cytochrome b, and 0.29 (0.15-0.51) for IRBP, reflecting the extreme rate heterogeneity of the mitochondrial gene relative to the nuclear.

Nonetheless, subsequent studies of karyotypes from Batomys and Phloeomys did not indicate a close relationship between the two (Rickart and Musser, 1993; Rickart and Heaney, 2002) . Our results confirm the presence of a well-supported clade of Old Endemics comprised of Phloeomys, Crateromys, Carpomys, and Batomys and place this clade securely at the base of the murine radiation. Although taxa in this clade have a number of traits that MH described as primitive for rodents, they also exhibit several unique features. Notably, all members of this clade are primarily arboreal and show a number of morphological specializations for arboreality including specialized hindfeet and a long, wellhaired tail. In addition, most members of this clade have distinctive pelage patterns that are not apparent in any other Philippine murine. Although MH noted these characteristics, they were hesitant to identify them as synapomorphies diagnosing this clade. Clearly a rigorous phylogenetic treatment of these morphological characters would be illuminating, and additional studies of generic limits are needed, particularly for Batomys and Crateromys (Musser et al., 1998) ; we note that the molecular data fail to recover Batomys as monophyletic and that divergence dates among taxa in clade E are quite deep.",

In contrast, Rickart and Heaney (2002) found substantial karyotypic differences between the two genera, and our phylogenetic hypotheses from mtDNA and nuclear IRBP sequences, as well as both combined, fail to place Crunomys as the sister taxon to Archboldomys. Rather, our phylogeny unites Crunomys with Maxomys as part of a large clade containing New Endemic taxa from the Philippines and Sunda Shelf. The difference between our molecular results and MH's morphological hypothesis may stem from the fact that Crunomys exhibits many of the same morphological simplifications as Archboldomys, including characteristics of the molars, tail length, and hind foot shape. Our molecular results reveal these traits to be either symplesiomorphic or homoplastic for these taxa.",

Careful diagnostic work (Musser and colleagues; see citations from Musser and Carleton, 1993) has remedied much of this confusion by erecting several new genera and narrowing the contents of the genus Rattus. MH described the Philippine New Endemic murines as a cluster of taxa that appear to share a number of derived characteristics of the skull and dentition, though they were hesitant to define this group as a lineage apart from the other New Endemic taxa that occur throughout Australasia.

Studies that use relaxed molecular clocks but employ 12 Mya as an absolute date of divergence for murines (e.g., Steppan et al., 2004; Chevret and Dobigny, 2005) naturally infer this as the date of murine origin (or, incorrectly, as the date of the Mus-Rattus split if the taxon sample did not include more basal murine lineages). In contrast, studies that do not use this murine calibration point (Adkins et al., 2003) , or that treat it as a minimum rather than an absolute date of divergence (Springer et al., 2003;  this study), infer dates of murine origin that are up to 10 to 15 million years older.",

First, this interpretation assumes that Progonomys (Siwalik Group, Pakistan, 11.8 Mya; Jacobs and Downs, 1994) and not Antemus (Siwalik Group, Pakistan, 13.75 Mya; Jacobs and Downs, 1994) represents the first occurrence of crown murines in the fossil record (see Flynn, 1985; Jacobs, 1977 for an alternative interpretation). Second, and more problematic, this interpretation assumes that the fossil record of murines is adequately sampled worldwide to conclude that murines were not present before the appearance of these taxa. Conflict between molecular clock estimates and the fossil record must be judged in light of the temporal and spatial sampling of the fossil record (Foote et al., 1999; Tavare et al., 2002) . We are unaware of any quantitative evaluation of the quality of the rodent fossil record, but given the spatial and temporal patchiness of the record for many mammalian groups, particularly in southern continents and the tropics (Tavare' et al., 2002) , we find the discrepancy between recent molecular dates (including ours) and those implied by the literal interpretation of the fossil record to be unsurprising. Given the observation that none of these fossils have been placed phylogenetically, and that the dental characters used to identify them are ambiguous and possibly convergent (Denys et al., 1995; Jansa and Weksler, 2004) , we prefer the conservative interpretation that the appearance of Progonomys at 12 Mya represents the minimum date of divergence for the murine radiation. Our estimated dates of divergence are in line with those inferred from recent molecular dating studies that employ relaxed-clock methods (see citations above) and predate those inferred by Steppan et al. (2004) by 7 to 10 My. Future analyses including additional rodent species, calibration points, and sequence data will be necessary to reconcile this discrepancy.",

All islands except Palawan are of oceanic origin and have never been connected to the Asian mainland. The geological history of the archipelago over the last 25 million years is extraordinarily complex (Hall, 1996 (Hall, , 1998 (Hall, , 2002 . Volcanic activity and tectonic uplift have formed new islands and added to existing ones, tectonic motion has moved island fragments throughout the region, and sea level changes have caused the joining and fragmentation of land masses. Each of these geological factors may have played a role in restricting or facilitating dispersal among islands and in the autochthonous diversification of murines in the Philippines (Heaney, 1986 (Heaney, , 2000 Heaney and Rickart, 1990; Steppan et al., 2003) . Musser and Heaney (1992) hypothesized that the Philippine murines colonized the islands from the Asian mainland in at least two waves, the first giving rise to the Old Endemic taxa with a subsequent wave founding the New Endemics. They suggested that the Old Endemics may have originated during the Miocene and early Pliocene, \"during that time when clusters of land began to appear above sea level to form insular precursors of the present-day Archipelago\" (Musser and Heaney, 1992:56) , whereas the New Endemics arrived much later during the late Pliocene or early Pleistocene, though they cautioned that this estimate was \"pure speculation based on known sea level lowerings\" (Musser and Heaney, 1992:95) . By adding a time dimension to our phylogenetic hypothesis, we can explicitly test these hypotheses and address whether certain geological events may have played a role in shaping the diversity of murine rodents in the Philippines.",

According to our analysis, the second clade of Old Endemics (clade D) must have arisen subsequent to clade E (15.8 \u00b1 3.4 Mya; Table 5 ); however, our analysis does not provide sufficient precision to distinguish between the times of origin for these two clades (Fig. 3, inset) . Recent results (Steppan et al., 2005) suggest that a clade comprising murine taxa from New Guinea subdivides the branch leading to the Philippine taxa in clade D. Therefore, our estimate for the origin of this Philippine clade may be too old. However, these New Guinean taxa appear to bisect the branch leading to Philippine taxa in clade D (see Fig. 6 in Steppan et al., 2005) , and based on our chronogram ( Fig. 3) our estimate is likely no more than 2.4 My too old. We clearly identify a second wave of dispersal into the islands to found the genus Bidlimus (clade B) and the taxa in Clade A (Fig. 3, inset) . Although our tree indicates that these were separate invasion events, we cannot distinguish between the times of origin for clades A and B (Table 5) ; they both occurred around 3.1 \u00b1 1.3 Mya. We date the origin of Crunomys (clade C) in the Philippines at 7.1 \u00b1 2.2 Mya, but note that the confidence interval from the IRBP parametric Bayesian (PB) analysis for this estimate overlaps with those from the New Endemic clades A and B (Fig. 3, inset) . Moreover, this may be an overestimate for this clade's origin into the Philippines as we lack samples from two species of Crunomys, including the single species native to Sulawesi.",

Our phylogenetic hypothesis suggests that there were multiple invasions during both of these time periods: at least two invasions were required to found the Old Endemic clades (clades D and E), and at least three to found the New Endemic lineages (clades A, B, and C). Further, our results confirm that most of the diversity of Philippine murines is associated with speciation that took place within the archipelago, with the two Old Endemic clades producing at least 15 and 25 species (the \"folivore\" and \"vermivore\" clades, respectively), and the three New Endemic clades producing 3 to 5 species each. Additionally, our results support earlier conclusions that the diversification took place over periods of time measured in millions of years, not during the middle and late Pleistocene but during the Pliocene and Miocene, and that the dynamics of species richness is best measured on that timescale (Heaney, 1986 (Heaney, ,2000 Heaney and Rickart, 1990; Steppan et al., 2003) .",

Fifteen million years ago, the only subaerial land corresponding to modern Philippine islands occurred in northern Luzon and as a distant landmass that became part of modern Mindanao (Fig. 4A) . The landmass of northern Luzon was well separated from the remaining proto-Philippine islands and other Australasian islands by large expanses of open water (Fig. 4A) . Intriguingly, living members of the two Old Endemic clades occur primarily on Luzon and reconstruction of the ancestral area for each of these clades is Luzon (Fig. 3) . One possible interpretation of our results is that taxa in these Old Endemic clades are the last living portion of a remarkably diverse radiation that was widespread across Australasia, and whose members on the Asian mainland are extinct. This interpretation is consistent with a recent study (Steppan et al, 2005) showing several New Guinean and Australian murines to be sister to taxa in the Old Endemic clade D.",

Although these landmasses had not yet reached their modern positions, they are close to each other and to the Sunda Shelf. Thus, several Philippine landmasses were available for colonization during this timespan, and several avenues of colonization existed, including pathways across shallow seas from Sulawesi, island-hopping across small islands between Borneo and the southern Philippines, as well as direct colonization across broad seas. Testing the role that Sulawesi played in providing a source population for Philippine murines will require including the single species of Crunomys and additional murine gen-era from that island. Similarly, testing Sunda Shelf associations will require far denser sampling of modern Sundaic taxa. Each of the New Endemic clades has members on Mindanao and Luzon, in addition to several of the smaller Philippine Islands.

In particular, integration of mitochondrial and nuclear genes in vertebrate phylogenetics is challenging, due to their extreme heterogeneity in several evolutionary characteristics (e.g., Springer et al. 1999) . In agreement with previous studies, our analyses reflect the disparate evolutionary dynamics of the two genomes, as all but two estimated model parameters differ significantly between the nuclear and mitochondrial genes (Table 4) . Despite this heterogeneity, we note that combined analysis of the two data sets under both parsimony and likelihood frameworks increased phylogenetic resolution. Reflecting this heterogeneity, the effect of data combination on support for resolved nodes was method dependent. Overall support was slightly reduced in the parsimony analysis of the combined data as compared to the analysis of IRBP alone, although some individual nodes received markedly increased bootstrap values; in contrast, uniform-model likelihood analysis reflected increased overall support for the combined-data analysis (Table 4) . Likewise, partitioned Bayesian analysis significantly increased support for a number of nodes relative to an unpartitioned analysis (Table 4) . Thus, our observations support the notion that mitochondrial and nuclear data sets can provide extremely useful, complementary phylogenetic information, given the analytical tools to address underlying heterogeneity of evolutionary dynamics.",

                "text": "In contrast, our results suggest that combination of mitochondrial and nuclear data to estimate divergence times can severely compromise those estimates. We used relatively ancient calibration points both external and internal to the muroid radiation, ranging in age from 6 to 70 million years. These dates are well within the range of sequence saturation for cytochrome b for the taxa involved (not shown), which causes rates of sequence evolution to be underestimated and divergence times consequently to be overestimated across the tree. This phenomenon is apparent even with the corrections afforded by the invariant sites plus P-distributed rates model used to analyze these data. Additionally, both our semiparametric and parametric relaxed molecular clock analyses yielded clear evidence that rate heterogeneity among lineages is much higher for cytochrome b than for IRBP. Thus, for the taxa and calibrations used here, cytochrome b appears to present the most severe problem with respect to changes in evolutionary rate, with the least prospect for estimating those changes, due to degradation of signal at high divergence levels. These effects lead, regardless of analytical method used (Table 5) , to what we interpret as severe overestimates of divergence times among Philippine rodents. This includes the partitioned Bayesian method of Thorne and Kishino (2002) , which integrates separate branch length estimates from multiple data sets (Table 5 , combined PB analysis). Although relaxed molecular clock analyses provide powerful tools for estimating divergence times when evolutionary rates are heterogeneous, we caution that some data sets undoubtedly present problems of estimation beyond the ability of current methods to ameliorate. We suggest that these methods will perform best across a range of sequence divergences where saturation is not a problem, or where a more comprehensive set of recent and ancient calibration points is available from the fossil record.",

With respect to the Philippine murines, Musser and Heaney (1992) identified the \"Old Endemic\" and \"New Endemic\" groups and hypothesized at least two waves of immigration into the archipelago. The present study provides the first explicitly phylogenetic test of many of MH's ideas and shows remarkable congruence with many of their conclusions, despite reliance on different data sources (morphology versus molecules) and different analytical methods (we employ an explicitly phylogenetic ap-proach). Although the molecular data identify five probable dispersal events, our dating analyses suggest that these dispersals were clustered, with colonization of Old Endemic taxa occurring ca. 15 Mya, and the New Endemic clades and Crunomys arriving 8 to 12 million years later. Thus, our data are largely consistent with the \"two fauna\" hypothesis of MH, but our estimated divergence dates are considerably older than many of the dates suggested in that study. In the future, integration of molecular, morphological and other phenotypic data from these rodents will provide important insights into the ecological mechanisms and adaptive processes that have shaped this fauna within the biogeographic framework presented here.",
