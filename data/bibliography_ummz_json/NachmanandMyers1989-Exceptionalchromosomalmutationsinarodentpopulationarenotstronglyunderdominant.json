(0 Whole-arm (Rb) translocations involved chromosomes 3/4 and 6/7. Acrocentric autosomes 3 and 4 possessed centromeric heterochromatin; however, their metacentric homolog, chromosome 3/4, showed little or no centromeric heterochromatin ( Fig. 2A ), suggesting that there may have been loss of DNA accompanying the fusion process. Both the metacentric, chromosome 6/7, and its acrocentric homologs, chromosomes 6 and 7, possessed centromeric heterochromatin ( Fig. 2A ). Twenty-three animals (55%) were heterozygous for a single Rb rearrangement, 2 animals (5%) were heterozygous for two Rb rearrangements, and the remaining 17 animals (40%) had no structural heterozygosity for wholearm translocations. The frequencies of Rb homozygotes and heterozygotes did not differ significantly from those expected homozygote; BIa, BIb, BIc, and BIT, supernumerary chromosomes; all other rearrangements here and in Table 2 occur as heterozygotes (Ea-X, euchromatic addition to the X chromosome). Pi-X, pericentric inversion on the X chromosome; Pi-11, pericentric inversion on autosome 11; Ea-17, euchromatic addition to autosome 17; other symbols and abbreviations are as in Table 1. under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (for Rb3,4, X2 goodness of fit x2 = 0.05 and 0.9 > P > 0.75; for Rb6,7, x2 = 0.002 and 0.975 > P > 0.95). (it) There was a complicated system of supernumerary chromosomes (B chromosomes) involving two distinct classes of elements. BI elements are large metacentric or submetacentric chromosomes that are mostly euchromatic and thus difficult to distinguish from autosomes. When digested with trypsin and stained with giemsa, however, they revealed little banding pattern and appeared as homogeneously stained regions. BI chromosomes contained only centromeric heterochromatin, as revealed by C-bands of both mitotic and meiotic figures, and contained only slightly more C-positive material than the autosomes (Fig. 2B ). BI chromosomes are divided into three types, BIa, BIb, and BIc, based on their size and morphology (Fig. 1B) , and were present in 12 animals (29%6). In contrast, BII elements are small acrocentric chromosomes that contain substantial centromeric heterochromatin in both mitosis and meiosis (Fig.  2B) . They were present in one or two copies in 4 animals (10%). (iiOM Centromeric rearrangements were found in three animals (7%) on either autosome 11 or the X chromosome. Banding data indicate that these changes in centromere position are most likely due to pericentric inversions rather than centromeric shifts or activation/inactivation of existing centromeres. (iv) Additions of euchromatic chromatin were present in 5 animals (12%). Two animals had additions of euchromatic (C-band-negative/G-band-positive) material adjacent to the centromere on the major arm of autosome 17, and 3 other animals had terminal euchromatic (but G-band negative) additions to the short arm of the X chromosome ( Fig. 2B ). Of the 42 animals sampled in this population, 32 (76%) exhibited some form of chromosomal heterozygosity.",

The number of chromosomally heterozygous individuals was not significantly different between these two samples (log-likelihood ratio G = 0.05 and 0.9 > P > 0.75), and the frequencies of individual rearrangements also did not differ significantly between 1979 and 1986 (for Rb3,4, G = 0.10 and 0.9 > P > 0.75; for Rb6,7, G = 0.06 and 0.9 > P> 0.75; for B chromosomes, G = 0.34 and 0.75 > P > 0.5). In addition, each of the specific rearrangements present in the 1979 sample was found again in the 1986 sample. The 1986 sample also contained three rearrangements (two pericentric inversions, Pi-11 and Pi-X, and one euchromatic addition, Ea-17) not found in the 1979 sample. These rearrangements were rare in the 1986 sample and thus their absence in the 1979 sample, which was much smaller, may be due to sampling bias. Analysis of chromosome pairing in diakinesis and metaphase I of meiosis provides additional support for the identity of the rearrangements deduced from banding of mitotic chromosomes. In 100 cells analyzed from three individuals, both Rb3,4 and Rb6,7 were found to consistently form trivalents. In 100 cells analyzed from four individuals containing one B chromosome (identified from mitotic preparations), a single unpaired element was always observed in metaphase I of meiosis. An alternative explanation for the identity of the metacentric elements labeled as BI chromosomes is that they derive from Rb translocations of small autosomes. Such an interpretation was favored by Vidal et al. (21) for similar metacentrics in an Argentine population; however, their report did not include either banding data or meiotic analysis. The hypothesis that these chromosomes arise from Rb fusions does not account for the increase in fundamental number that accompanies them. Further, analysis of 100 meiotic metaphase cells from animals possessing these chromosomes revealed no trivalents other than those identifiable as Rb3,4 or Rb6,7. For these reasons we favor the interpretation that these elements are supernumerary chromosomes, despite their typically autosomal C-band pattern.",

There was no corre- (1989) spondence between any of the chromosomal rearrangements and particular alleles among these polymorphic loci. Since even closely related species often have fixed allozymic differences, a sample containing more than one species may show an inflated level of polymorphism. However, the proportion of polymorphic loci in this population (P = 0.25) was typical or slightly low for rodent species in general (22) . Morphologic analyses of all single cranial measurements showed continuous unimodal distributions, and graphs of principal component scores of these measurements formed single clusters. There was no correspondence between any of the chromosomal rearrangements and any craniometric characteristic. Laboratory matings indicated that animals possessing any of the rearrangements found in the population were fertile (Table 3 ). Among wild-caught animals, 16 out of 19 matings (84.2%) produced litters (n = 67 offspring). The 3 unsuccessful matings were known to involve very old animals. This degree of mating success is typical for breeding wild colonies ofother sigmodontine species in our laboratory. The Holochilus colony is in its fourth generation and offspring remain fertile.",

(i) Neither the amount of chromosomal variability nor the frequencies of individual rearrangements differ significantly between the 1979 and 1986 samples. Although the small size of the first sample precludes detection of small frequency differences, it is noteworthy that the relative abundance of the different rearrangements remained unchanged between the samples and that the actual numbers are very similar. Field observations indicate that Holochilus breed throughout the year in central Paraguay, and laboratory studies show that the gen- Karyotypes of parents refer to designations given in Tables 1 and  2 . Crosses are listed in order of increasing structural differences between parents. Abbreviations indicate the rearrangements that are polymorphic between mated individuals and are defined in Table 1 . Crosses shown here were chosen to illustrate maximum variation of chromosomal differences. eration time is less than 3 months. Thus, a conservative estimate indicates that at least 20 generations elapsed in 7 years. Wright (25) and subsequent investigators (26, 27) have shown that in the absence of a high mutation rate, new chromosomal variants that reduce fitness in the heterozygous condition will be rapidly eliminated or rarely fixed. Thus, the persistence at similar frequencies ofthe same rearrangements in our two samples taken more than 20 generations apart is consistent with the hypothesis that these rearrangements are not negatively heterotic. (it) We have continued to breed animals for four generations (n = 115 offspring) and have detected no combination of chromosomal rearrangements that results in infertility or reduced litter size (mean litter size = 4.4). All offspring have been karyotyped and none show any degree of aneuploidy. This suggests that polymorphisms in this population are not strongly underdominant; however, these data do not preclude the possibility of weak selection acting against heterozygotes. Measuring small selection coefficients (e.g., <10%o) requires very large sample sizes, either to detect deviations from Hardy-Weinberg proportions in nature or to measure fitness differences in the laboratory. Further, we caution against interpreting laboratory breeding experiments as a way to discriminate subtle differences in fitness that may be biologically much more significant in a natural population. (iii) The kind of variation (but not the specific rearrangements) we have described for this population of Holochilus characterizes the species over a wide geographic area. Earlier studies in Argentina (21, 28, 29) , Brazil (30, 31), and elsewhere in Paraguay (P.M., unpublished data) suggested that Holochilus might have extensive variation in Rb rearrangements, number of B chromosomes, and pericentric inversions, although banding data were not available in most cases and the samples from single populations were small. The widespread occurrence of these polymorphisms would be unlikely if substantial costs were associated with them.",

                "text": "These results have important implications for current models of chromosomal speciation. These models, which have served as examples of how new species might be formed in the absence of geographic separation, propose that chromosomal changes can lead to reproductive isolation due to the decreased fertility of heterozygotes (2-5) or the decreased viability of their progeny (6) . The breeding data for Holochilus and the large number, temporal stability, and widespread nature of chromosomal rearrangements in Holochilus do not support such a view and argue instead that chromosomal polymorphisms, though extreme, do not reduce fitness substantially in this species. Although the data presented here are insufficient to detect weak selective pressures, they are inconsistent with the presence of strong negative heterosis that is required by most models of chromosomal speciation, and these data are entirely consistent with the hypothesis that no selection is acting against heterozygotes. A comparison of this study of Holochilus with chromosomal studies ofthe house mouse (Mus musculus) (12), the common shrew (Sorex araneus) (13), and the domestic sheep (Ovis aries) (32) demonstrates that the same kind of chromosomal rearrangement can have extremely different effects on fitness in different species. Therefore, no single model will account for the evolution of chromosomes in all species, and models of chromosomal speciation should only be applied to situations where selection against heterozygotes has been verified (33) (34) (35) . The data presented here show that the usually held assumption of strong chromosomal underdominance is not always valid. In situations such as this, chromosomal mutations may accompany but probably do not cause speciation.",
