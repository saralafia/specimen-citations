In the lower Mississippi Valley the ranges of the two species overlap broadly, but in the Atlantic states they come into contact only slightly (Osgood 1909, p. 29, and figs. 2-3) . In the laboratory the woodmouse and the cotton-mouse will cross and both the male and female hybrid offspring are fully fertile (Dice, 1937a; pp. 2-3) . It has therefore seemed important to examine carefully the mice of the Dismal Swamp region of Virginia, where both species occur, to determine whether or not there is any evidence of hybridization between them in that area.",

The animal was successfully raised and kept in captivity for 5 months.The area where the prairie dog control work was being conducted is in the north central part of New Mexico at an altitude of 8,000 feet. The holes of the prairie dog (Cynomys gunnisoni zuniensis) were treated with carbon bisulphide and then exploded in order to force the poisonous gases into all parts of the burrows. Each hole was covered with dirt immediately after treatment to confine the fumes, and also to indicate success by the number of holes remaining closed. About half an hour after treatment, the holes were examined to determine whether any of those gassed had been re-opened. Suddenly, about 25 feet in front of us, an adult black-footed ferret dashed into a hole with one of its young in its mouth. We hurried to the spot in time to stop the adult from taking the second young, which was about 5 feet from the opening of the burrow. As we stood beside the young one, the adult ferret rushed to the opening of the hole about six times, each time challenging us with a chattering scold. These ruses ended at the opening of the burrow.",
