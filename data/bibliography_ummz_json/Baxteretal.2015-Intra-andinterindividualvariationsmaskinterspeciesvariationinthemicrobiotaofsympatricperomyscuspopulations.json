We performed a capture-markrelease experiment in which we obtained 16S rRNA gene sequence data from 49 animals at multiple time points. In addition, we performed 18S rRNA gene sequencing of the same samples to characterize the diet of each individual. Our analysis could not distinguish between the two species of Peromyscus on the basis of the structures of their microbiotas. However, we did observe a set of bacterial populations that were found in every animal. Most notable were abundant representatives of the genera Lactobacillus and Helicobacter. When we combined the 16S and 18S rRNA gene sequence analyses, we were unable to distinguish the communities on the basis of the animal's diet. Furthermore, there were no discernible differences in the structure of the gut communities based on the capture site or their developmental or physiological status. Finally, in contrast to humans, where each individual has a unique microbiota when sampled over years, among the animals captured in this study, the uniqueness of each microbiota was lost within a week of the original sampling. Wild populations provide an opportunity to study host-microbiota interactions as they originally evolved, and the ability to perform natural experiments will facilitate a greater understanding of the factors that shape the structure and function of the gut microbiota.",

Among humans, it is widely accepted that the bacterial species composition within the intestines (i.e., the gut microbiota) is unique to each person and that the composition of the microbiota is the product of various factors, including the individual's genetics, diet, immune system, and behaviors (1) . The amount that each of these contributes to shaping of the microbiota is unclear. Regardless, it is apparent that individuals within a family tend to harbor a more similar microbiota than others, leading to the suggestion that a person's microbiota is obtained horizontally as it is seeded by those in the environment (e.g., parents and siblings) and shaped via selection by a common culture, environment, and diet (2) (3) (4) (5) . This process of host selection and transmission has led to the hypothesis that the structure of the human gut microbiota and animal-associated communities, in general, is the result of coevolutionary processes (6) .",

One approach has been the reciprocal transplants of gut contents between germfree animals (e.g., zebrafish to mice, mice to zebrafish) in which the altered niche space of the host environment results in a remodeling of the inoculated community (7) (8) (9) . Another approach has been to characterize the gut microbiotas of diverse animals, largely sampled in zoos and reared on artificial diets, to show that these gut communities cluster according to broad dietary classifications (e.g., herbivore, carnivore, omnivore) (10) (11) (12) . However, both approaches represent artifactual and extreme comparisons across the evolutionary history of animals. Others have performed natural experiments of sympatric and nonsympatric populations of insects (13, 14) , primates (15) (16) (17) , and bats (18) . By studying animals within a common habitat, studies utilizing sympatric populations have shown that interin-dividual variations within a host species are greater than the variation between host species. That these studies frequently fail to find convincing concordance between host evolution and the similarity of their gut communities suggests that host genetics may have a limited role in the shaping of the microbiota.",

Again, it is unclear whether this is a product of the unique genetics of each individual or differences in diet, life history, or behaviors. In contrast to humans, chimpanzees do not appear to harbor individualized gut community structures (16) . In a laboratory setting, while individual Mus musculus mice living with other mice do not harbor individualized gut community structures, littermates, cagemates, and mice from the same breeding colony or vendor still tend to have more similar microbiota than others (21) (22) (23) .

These species are thought to have diverged from their common ancestor approximately 500 thousand years ago (24) . Both species are widely distributed throughout North America, with P. leucopus being more commonly associated with deciduous forests and P. m. gracilis being more common in boreal forests (25) . Northern Michigan is unique because it is part of a tension zone where there is a transition between boreal and deciduous habitats. As a result, P. leucopus and P. m. gracilis are sympatric in this environment, despite occupying apparently identical niches (26) . This framework provided a unique opportunity to study the contributions of host phylogeny, environment, and other factors to the shaping of the mammalian gut microbiota. Using 16S and 18S rRNA gene sequencing, we were able to characterize the gut community structures of these animals and the composition of their diets. Furthermore, because the animals were captured live and released, we were able to characterize the change in the microbiota of the animals over the course of several months. Thus, it was possible to assess inter-and intraindividual variations in the context of interspecies differences while accounting for the diet, habitat, and physiological characteristics of the individuals.",

For practical reasons, we did not attempt to remove all of the microscopic members of these taxa; however, downstream analysis showed that microscopic members accounted for only a small portion of the total sequences.

We used several community analysis tools to help analyze the abundance distributions of the bacterial OTUs and phylotypes and the diet-related phylotypes. The number of observed OTUs and Shannon diversity were calculated by rarefaction with 1,000 randomizations. Comparisons of rank-transformed \u2423-diversity metrics were performed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) accounting for the presence of repeated measures for some animals. To calculate distances between the structures of communities, we used the Yue and Clayton (33) distance metric ( YC ), which takes into account the membership and abundance of each OTU, and the weighted UniFrac distance, which takes into account the phylogenetic relationships between the populations in the communities (34) . These distances were calculated in mothur on the basis of an average of 100 randomizations. Where appropriate, results based on the YC metric are denoted with a subscript and those based on the weighted UniFrac metric are denoted with a W subscript. Tests to determine whether the communities overlapped were performed by analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) and analysis of homogeneity of variance, again accounting for repeated measures (35, 36) . In addition, we used the Wilcoxon nonparametric test to compare the median distance of each sample with that of every other sample. Correlations between matrices were performed with the Mantel test by using 10,000 randomizations. After a single subsampling, samples were assigned to community types by using Dirichlet multinomial mixture (DMM) models based on their phylotype abundance (37) ; comparisons of DMM models generated after multiple subsamplings were not meaningfully different. To identify OTUs that were significantly different between samples, we applied two approaches to data derived from a single subsampling of the data. Again, repeated analyses with multiple subsamplings did not meaningfully affect the results. First, we used the random-forest algorithm as implemented in the randomForest R package with 10,000 trees (38) . Second, we simplified the data set by selecting those OTUs that were identified in at least half of the samples and then used a rank-transformed ANOVA that corrected for repeated measures to identify OTUs that differed significantly between the two groups. In all of the analyses, P values were corrected for multiple comparisons by using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction with an experiment-wide significance threshold of 0.05 (39) .",

These results demonstrate that although there was considerable variation among the Peromyscus sp. animals that we sampled, there was a conserved taxonomic core.",

To investigate possible sex-based differences further, we focused on sexually mature adult males and females, which had descended testes and emerged nipples, respectively; however, we were unable to identify a sex-based effect on the richness, Shannon diversity, phylogenetic diversity, or community structure. Furthermore, none of the OTUs that appeared in at least half of the samples were differentially enriched in either sex.

The overall trend was for older mice to have a richer and more complex community. This was paralleled by a modest correlation between the animals' weight and their Shannon diversity (Spearman's \u03ed 0.31; Fig. 4B) . Although there did appear to be some effect of age on the richness and diversity of the communities, it was difficult to ascribe much biological significance to these differences, considering that the differences in overall community structure were not significantly different from each other and there were no OTUs that differed in abundance among the three age categories. Overall, by the parameters we were able to measure, we were unable to detect a robust effect of host physiology on their microbiota.",

When we used these clusters to test for an association within the community structure distance matrix between the microbiotas of the mice, we did not observe a significant effect of diet on community structure. We then used the random-forest algorithm to identify features in the microbiota that could distinguish the two dietary groups; however, the out-of-bag error rate was 37.9%, which indicates that it was unable to correctly classify the samples. As these analyses demonstrate, we were unable to find associations between specific members of the microbiota and the dietary contents of each sample.

Studies of other animals have observed less variation in microbiota structure within an individual over time than between individuals. We sought to determine whether nondomesticated animals also harbor personalized microbiotas. To investigate this in Peromyscus spp., we took advantage of the ability to catch and release the same animal multiple times. By the OTU-based approach, the median intraindividual distance was significantly less than the median interindividual distance (Fig.  5A) ; however, by the weighted UniFrac-based approach, the difference was not significant. To investigate this further, we calculated the number of days that elapsed between recapturing events and created five time windows such that each window had approximately the same number of mice that were recaptured within that time period (i.e., 1 , and \u054620 [n \u03ed 24] days apart). We then compared the intra-animal distances within these time periods to the interanimal distances of different mice captured within the same intervals. Surprisingly, only the mice captured between 1 and 3 days apart were more similar to themselves than to other mice (Fig. 5B) . In none of the other time windows was there a significant difference between the samples collected from the same animal and the samples collected from different animals.

In this study, we observed two types of diets in the mice-one dominated by plant material and one that was a mixture of plants, arthropods, and fungi. That we were unable to identify a Peromyscus sp. preference or distinguish between the microbiotas of animals consuming the two diet types indicates that the two species shared a niche and that their diets did not have a major impact on the variation in the observed community structures. This result is not unlike what is observed in humans, where there are immediate shifts in the gut microbiota with an abrupt change in diet; however, the microbiotas of different people do not converge to a common structure (45) .",

Similar results have been observed in wild populations of primates (16) . Although the Peromyscus mice we sampled did show signs of individualization of the samples collected within a week of each other, this signal was lost over longer periods of time. The contrast between the individuality of human microbiotas and the lack of individuality in wild populations suggests that there are behavioral or cultural factors (e.g., hygiene, segregated families) that drive individualization. A better understanding of the pro-cesses that maintain or reduce individualization will help in designing microbiota-focused therapies for humans.",

In spite of the significant variation among animals in this study, there was strong evidence of a core set of taxa that were observed across all of the animals in this study (Fig. 3) . At the genus and OTU levels, there were many taxa present that are commonly found in laboratory populations of M. musculus. Most striking, however, was the presence of multiple different OTUs affiliated with Lactobacillus in every animal we sampled. Furthermore, these populations were among the most abundant populations in the Peromyscus gut microbiota (median \u03ed 11.2%, range \u03ed 3.0 to 93.0%). Although Lactobacillus populations are commonly observed in M. musculus, they tend to be rare (e.g., \u03fd3%) (23) . It was also interesting that nearly all of the animals we captured harbored OTUs affiliated with Helicobacter, which is commonly associated with colitis in immunodeficient mice (46) . Our result confirms the assertion that Helicobacter bacteria are normal symbionts of rodents that can be commensals or pathogens in different contexts. Although Peromyscus and Mus are distantly related, these stark differences in gut community composition suggest the need for further exploration of the natural Mus microbiota and immune system (47) .",
