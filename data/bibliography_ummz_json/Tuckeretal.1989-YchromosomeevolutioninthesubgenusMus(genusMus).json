Variation in hybridization patterns between species was characterized by differences in fragment lengths of both intensely and faintly hybridizing fragments, whereas variation in hybridization patterns within species was characterized primarily by differences in fragment lengths of faintly hybridizing fragments. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted based on fragment size variation within and among species.

OHNO (1967) recalled this hypothesis to explain vertebrate sex chromosome evolution including the evolution of the mammalian X and Y chromosomes. The X and Y chromosomes of mammals exhibit extreme heteromorphism and, with rare exception, recombination between them is limited to a small region (SOLARI 1974) . Thus, the majority of the Y chromosome is monosomic and inherited from father to son.",

We used pYB 10 (EICHER et al. 1989) as a probe in combination with eight restriction enzymes to identify species-specific patterns of hybridization from a large sample of mice in the subgenus Mus, including Mus spretus, Mus hortulanus (= M. spicilegus, BONHOMME 1986) , Mus abbotti (= M . spretoides or M. macedonicus, BONHOMME 1986) , Mus musculus and Mus domesticus.

Fragments of equal molecular weight generated by each restriction enzyme were assumed identical between taxa. Each individual taxon was scored for the presence or absence of all restriction fragments identified in a given set of taxa. For all phylogenetic analyses, variation in copy number atnong shared restriction fragments was not scored as separate characters and thus the phylogenetic trees produced represent minimal estimates of the variation among Y chromosomes.

In this paper we have further investigated the evolution of YBlO and adjacent Y chromosome sequences in these five species at both the species and population levels.

However, we interpret the observed differences in intensity of hybridization among restriction fragments as primarily reflecting variation in copy number of YBlO sequences, intensely hybridizing fragments being high copy number fragments and faintly hybridizing fragments being low copy number fragments. The reason for this interpretation results from two observations. No new fragments were observed when M. spretus, M. hortulanus, M. abbotti, M. musculus and M. domesticus DNAs were hybridized with pYBlO at lower stringency conditions and hybridization intensity increased for all restriction fragments across taxa following a decrease in stringency conditions (EICHER et al. 1989) . We, thus, interpret variation in intensity of hybridization among equal sized (shared) fragments as reflecting amplification of YBlO sequences. Additionally, we suggest that presumed high copy number fragments that are unique to a given taxon reflect sequence divergence and amplification of Y chromosome sequences whereas presumed low copy fragments unique to a given taxon reflect sequence divergence such as single restriction site changes. In general, we conclude that interspecies variation of YB 10 and ad-jacent sequences is characterized by both sequence divergence and sequence amplification, whereas intraspecies variation is characterized primarily by sequence divergence.",

                "text": "In spite of this problem, there is strong evidence to suggest that the YBlO repeat is phylogenetically informative. This is evidenced from the similarities between the phylogenetic trees depicted in Figure 2 and phylogenies of the same taxa constructed from a variety of data sets. For example, a consensus of the two trees depicted in Figure 2 is concordant with trees generated from mitochondrial DNA data of FERRIS et al. (1983) with regard to the position of M . spretus, M. hortulanus and M. abbotti. In both the mitochondrial DNA and Y chromosome analyses these taxa are as different from each other as they are from the M. musculus/M. domesticus lineage. This is in contrast to phylogenetic trees generated from biochemical data that place M. hortulanus and M. abbotti as sister taxa (BONHOMME et al. 1984) and a phylogenetic tree generated from differences in the 5' end of the 16s mitochondrial rDNA molecule (FORT et al. 1984; BONHOMME 1986 ) that places M. hortulanus (= M. spicilegus) as a sister taxa to the M. domesticuslM. musculus lineage. The position of M. m. castaneus within the M. musculus cluster in all the phylogenetic trees ( Figures 2, A and B, and 4 ) contrasts with its placement as a distinct lineage in phylogenetic trees generated from the mitochondrial DNA (FERRIS et al. 1983) but its position in the second phylogenetic analysis (Figure 4) is concordant with the phylogenetic relationships generated from biochemical data of BONHOMME et al. (1984) . In addition, the placement of M, m, musculus and M . m. molossinus as sister taxa relative to M. m. castaneus and M. domesticus in the second phylogenetic analysis (Figure 4 ) is in agreement with phylogenetic analyses generated from mitochondrial DNA data (FERRIS et al. 1983; YONEGAWA et al. 1986) , biochemical data (BONHOMME et al. 1984) , nontranscribed spacer regions of ribosomal DNA (SU- ZUKI et al. 1986) , T-lymphocyte differentiation antigen types (KURIHARA et al. 1985; MORIWAKI et al. 1986) and &-microglobulin types of the class I major histocompatibility antigens (ROBINSON et al. 1984) . The placement of M. musculus and M. domesticus as sister taxa relative to M. spretus, M. hortulanus and M. abbotti agrees with phylogenetic trees generated from both the mitochondrial and biochemical data sets. Finally, the position of M. domesticus and M. musculus as monophyletic taxa is in accordance with all the data sets in the above comparisons. We conclude that the similarities among the phylogenetic relationships generated by the Y chromosome data and other data sets indicate that the paternally inherited repeated sequence YBlO provides phylogenetic information within and among a closely related group of species. Inconsistencies among the trees generated by different sets of characters probably reflect the close evolutionary relationships of these taxa. (FERRIS et al. 1983) , Y chromosome change has taken place within both lineages at the population level since that time.",

It is interesting to note that most of the polymorphism for the t-complex of genes in European populations of wild house mice is found within M. domesticus and not within M. musculus (KLEIN, SIPOS and FIGUEROA 1984) .

The similarity among the Y chromosomes of the Robertsonian metacentric chromo-some populations from Orobie, Molise and Lipari is surprising for two reasons. These populations are geographically isolated from each other and, with the exception of two Robertsonian chromosomes shared between the Orobie and Molise populations, each carries a different arrangement of Robertsonian chromosomes (reviewed in SAGE 198 1) .

Although the biochemical and mitochondrial data suggest otherwise, our single sample identified as M. d. praetextus is clearly distinguishable on the basis of its Y chromosome type from other M . domesticus and may reflect a real subspecific difference. Additionally, a M . domesticus Y chromosome type identified in North America is distinct from the Y chromosome types sampled in Europe and the Mediterranean region. Presumably, this Y chromosome type exists in an, as yet, unidentified population of M. domesticus in Europe, assuming that the presence of M . domesticus in N. America is associated with European colonization. Documentation of the rapid rate of evolution of a Y chromosome specific repeated DNA sequence in a group of closely related species presents many intriguing questions. For example, does a DNA sequence have a unique mode of evolution by virtue of its isolation on a monosomic chromosome? The exclusive occurrence of YB 10 sequences on the Y chromosome in the subgenus Mus and its restriction on the Y chromosome to a region that does not undergo recombination with the X chromosome (EICHER, PHILLIPS and WASHBURN 1983) precludes mechanisms of amplification that involve homologous (or nonhomologous) chromosome exchange. Amplification of this sequence could occur by unequal exchange between sister chromatids of the Y chromosome or by a process of duplicative transposition (ORGEL and CRICK 1980; DOOLITTLE and SAPIENZA 1980) limited in this instance to the Y chromosome. Are other Y chromosome specific DNA sequences evolving in a like manner, i.e., is sequence amplification and divergence a general phenomenon of the mammalian Y chromosome?",

Overall, phylogenetic analyses of M. domesticus demonstrate the highly variable nature of the Y chromosome throughout its range. For example, extensive variation exists among Y chromosomes of M. domesticus from Germany in contrast to the relative lack of variation observed among M. musculus, in particular and, among M. m. musculus from Europe. Finally, a sample of M. musculus and M. domesticus mice collected along a 160-km transect in the Federal Republic of Germany and Austria (the Austria-F.R.G. sample of M. musculus and the Freising-Kreise sample of M. domesticus) were included in this analysis and minimal variation involving one or two fragments was identified among Y chromosomes within either species.
