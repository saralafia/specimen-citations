In the large crania, as a result of a greater extension and forward pitch of the ascending ramus of the mandible, the supraoccipital region approximates a 50-degree angle to the flat surface. Due to a lesser development of the ascending ramus, this angle is nearly 90 degrees in the smaller males. These differences in the development of the ascending ramus of the mandible probably relate to the size of the hyoid apparatus, which is larger (relatively as well as actually) in the large-skulled group than in the small monkeys, and may result in a difference in the male vocalization. As might be expected, females of both groups have supraoccipital angles of nearly 90 degrees, owing primarily to the reduced size of the hyoid.",

Inorder to understand better this apparent sympatry and the character differences observed in the sample from Tabasco, I examined 110 specimens of pigra, numerous examples of other populations of A. palliata, and representatives of several South American species of Alouatta. The geographic range of pigra was restricted to the region of Peten, Guatemala by Hall and Kelson (1959:220) , but I have examined specimens referable to pigrafrom the states of Tabasco,Chiapas, Yucatan, and Campeche, Mexico, May 1970 SMITH-SYST EMATIC STATUS OF ALOUATTA PIGRA 363 as well as from Guatemala and British Honduras (Fig. 3) . Previously, the material from British Honduras had been allocated to Alouatta palliata luctuosa, also described by Lawrence (1933:337-33 9) . The description of this subspecies was based on a single adult male and it was distinguished from piara primarily on the basis of smaller size. Through the courtesy of Miss Lawrence, I was able to examine the holotype of luctuosa (no. 24059-, MCZ) , from Mountain Cow, Cayo District, British Honduras. It falls well within the range of individual variation observed in pigra (Table 1) , and I therefore regard luctuosa as a junior synonym of pigra. The characters discussed above for pigra were found to be constant throughout its geographic range, outlined above, and I found no evidence of intergradation with populations of A. p. mexicana to the north or A. p. palliata to the south. The only variation observed in pigra involved the color of the pelage in that in some individuals the bases of the hairs were reddish. However, the characteristic yellowish mantle of palliata was never encountered in specimens of pigra.",

In most respects, aequatorialis resembles typical palliata and the few specimens examined from Panama seem to indicate the presence of a well-defined zone of intergradation . However, in some ways aequatorialis resembles pigra. Both are large monkeys and frequently the typical mantle coloration of palliata is reduced or lost completely in some individuals of aequaiorialis. Perhaps the most interesting features are seen in the dentition. The dental arcade of aequatorialis generally does not exhibit such a marked trend in size reduction as seen in typical palliata. The metacone on M2 is not appreciably dislocated lingually and the stylar shelf on this tooth is only slightly narrower than on MI. Both parastyle and metastyle are present on the stylar shelf. The mesostyle is weakly present in the form of a labial loop of the ectoloph, In the specimens of aequatorialis that I examined, this loop remained open and was not pinched off to form a strong mesostyle as seen in pigra. The third upper molar is noticeably smaller and the metacone is reduced in size, thereby altering the square shape of this tooth.",

Alouatta palliata mexicana vicinity Jesus Carranza, Veracruz 10 81.1 52.9 9 29.5 11.1 39.4 9 96.7 9 (79.6-83.6) . (51.0-55.6) (27.1-32,.5 ) ( 9'.9-12,.0) (3,7.5-40. One of these I have referred to as pigra and the other for the purpose of this discussion, I shall continue to refer to as palliata (including aequatorialis unless otherwise noted). The population of palliata in southern Mexico (mexicana) is more or less isolated from other populations of palliata in Central America by the interposed range of pigra. At one known locality in Tabasco, pigra occurs sympatrically with mexicana. Insofar as the taxonomic status of the monkeys involved is concerned, there seem to be two possible interpretations of this situation. The first of these would be to retain pigra as an extremely well-defined subspecies of palliata.This might seem reasonable because howler monkeys are known for their gregarious, clanistic social behavior and interbreeding between such clan groups could be infrequent enough to foster a certain amount of character fixation at the local level. However, it seems doubtful that such character fixation, through segregation of clan groups, could account for the degree of distinctness observed between the two character states described above. In fact, the small amount of geographic variation found between populations of palliata (excluding pigra and aequatorialis ), in Middle America, suggests unhindered gene flow between clan groups and little, if any, localization of characters. Furthermore, the population here identified as pigra is much more distinct morphologically from the two adjacent populations of palliata than either of the latter is from each other or from more southerly subspecies. The apparent lack of intergradation between the strikingly distinct populations of pigra and palliate, coupled with the observed sympatry, places in doubt the subspecific status of pigra, as previously defined.",

In addition to the documented morphological differences, there may also be some ecological segregation of pigra and the adjacent populations of palliata. The area inhabited by pigra, tropical rainforest of northern Guatemala and adjacent British Honduras and southern Mexico, represents one of the few relatively undisturbed and extensive rainforests in Middle America. The forested region of Darien, Panama and northwestern South America, inhabited by aequatorialis, may be a comparable region. In the intervening area of Central America, occupied by typical palliata, a wide variety of forest situations prevail. Whereas, pigra seems to prefer extensive undisturbed and mesic tropical forest, palliata apparently thrives in less extensive, subclimax or secondary forest, which also may be somewhat xeric in nature. In Nicaragua, for example, it is not uncommon to see bands of howlers (A. p. palliata) foraging in small stands of mango trees near human dwellings. The observed sympatry at Macuspana, Tabasco, could have resulted from recent disturbance of the forest in that region caused by road construction and increased agriculture. At Palenque, Chiapas, just a short distance away and where the forest still remains more or less undisturbed, howler monkeys are of the pigra type. Therefore, until further evidence to the contrary is presented, I regard the black howler of Middle America as a fuIl species, Alouatta pigra Lawrence.",

To briefly summarize, Gray (1845:220) characterized the species Mijcetes oillosus as: \"Black; hair very long, silky, uniform black, on the cheeks under the ears brownish at the base.\" He listed no precise type locality, but noted that cdlosus \"Inhab, Brazils,\" as did seven of the eight other howler monkeys described in the same paper. Later, Sclater (1872:5-6) wrote: \"Mr. Salvin has often spoken to me of the Black Howler of Vera Cruz; but it is only recently that I have had an opportunity of examining a skin of this animal, obtained by him in that district in May 18B2....\"This specimen had been identified as Mycetes caraya and Sclater recognized it as distinct from that species based on the inclination of the facial hairs. He continued (p. 6): \"Other differences would be, no doubt, found on comparison, which, however, requires further materials for the purpose. But I have no doubt of the distinctness of the northern species [M. caraya considered as the southern species]; and I believed it to be undescribed, until I compared it with the single imperfect stuffed specimen in the British Museum upon which Mycetes oillosus, Gray, was founded. This [villosus] is stated to be from 'Brazil', but I think it probable that there has been a mistake in the locality, and that it is identical with the Guatemalan animal.\" Lawrence (1933:336) pointed out that, if Sclater was correct, there was noway to determine the exact type locality and she suggested that M. villosusbe regarded \"as indeterminable due to the absence of a type locality and the imperfect condition of the type.\" Therefore, she elected to apply the specific name .polliata to, Middle American howlers. However, several recent authors. (Handley, 1966:774; Hall and Kelson, 195-9/:221) have not followed Lawrence's recommendation and have used the specific name A. villosa for these monkeys.",

Also, the holotypeof v'illosa 'agreedvmore o,r less, with the photographs of pigra. This was not particularlysurprising, because pigra closely resembles the South American A. senicula, major differences being the robustness of the dentition and the large size of the males in the former, Hill noted in his comparisons that the dentition of the holotype of oillosa was not noticeably different from pigra in cusp pattern but was reduced \u2022in size.

This conclusion was based primarily on similarities exhibited by the lower molariform teeth. Unfortunately, all of the species of the genus Homunculus except one, H. harringtoni Rusconi, are represented only by portions of the lower dentition. The genus has been reported from, the late Oligocene of Patagonia by Rusconi (1935) and others, thereby illustrating the widespread distribution of these monkeys in South America in the early Cenozoic. Absolutely nothing is known about alouattine evolution in Middle America, concerning which there are several feasible hypotheses. One of these would be to assume that in the early to middle Pliocene, before a wide land connection was re-established between North and South America, a segment of the early alouattine stock penetrated onto the Nuclear Central American land mass (consisting of Mexico south of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, Guatemala, British Honduras, EI Salvador, Honduras, and north-central Nicaragua) from South America either by \"island-hopping\" or along a narrow corridor, or a combination of both. This stock, being rather primitive, may have had a long\" narrow skull and upper molar teeth that exhibited little reduction in size and modification of the cusp pattern. Subsequent isolation and differentiation of this stock may have resulted in the formation of Alouatta pigra. In South America, another segment of the primitive alouattine stock may have given rise to the senicula group, in which there seems to have been a trend toward smaller teeth in the absence of marked alteration of the cusp pattern or modifications in the shape of the skull.",
