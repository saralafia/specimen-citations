    "abstract": "GROWTH IN THE DEER-MOUSE, PEROMYSCUS MANICULATUS By LEE R. DICE AND ROBERT M. BRADLEY This paper describes the growth in body dimensions and in weight of seven subspecies of the deer-mouse, Peromyscus maniculatus, from the age of 15days up to, for most of the stocks, 186 days. Arthur Svihla (1934, 1935, 1936) has presented growth curves of three subspecies (artemisiae, bairdii, and oreas) from birth to an age of 60 days. Our study therefore extends the analysis of growth in this species to a greater age than was considered by Svihla. The only subspecies for which the rate of growth has been studied both by Svihla and by ourselves is bairdii. The junior author made all the measurements summarized here. Dr. Adolph Murie calculated the means of the measurements, but found himself unable to complete the preparation of the manuscript. The senior author directed the study and has written the report. The three stocks of deer-mice from California and Baja California were presented by Dr. Francis B.",

In part these variations are undoubtedly due to errors in measurement. It is not easy to secure an accurate measurement of a living mouse, even under deep anesthesia. Any error in measurement makes a considerable difference in the resulting mean when, as here, the number of individuals involved are few. Fluctuations are produced in some of the curves by one or more of the litters having been measured at age intervals different from those of the other litters of the subspecies. Irregularities in the curves also are sometimes caused by the death of a mouse that happened to be either an unusually large or an exceptionally small member of the series. A few actual shrinkages in size may have occurred from time to time, especially in weight. In general, however, the curves are fairly regular. No attempt has been made to smooth them in any way.",

At about four weeks of age, most of the subspecies begin to slacken their rate of growth in the dimensions of the body, but it is not until the age of six weeks that most of the forms have decreased their speed of growth to the subadult rate. Attention is especially called to the graph of weight correlated with age ( fig. 5) , where it appears that all seven of the subspecies continued to grow approximately at the same rate between the ages of 15 and 42 days. A few subspecies continued to grow fairly rapidly in certain dimensions after the age of six weeks, but, in these forms also, the subadult growth rate was soon thereafter established.",

Some males of the species contain motile sperm and are therefore possibly sexually mature at the age of about 40 days.
