    "abstract": "The direct and indirect effects of seed predation by a Neotropical community of small rodents and large mammals were examined in a 1.5-year exclosure experiment in Corcovado National Park, Costa Rica. This park has an intact terrestrial mammalian community, including small rodents and large mammalian seed predators, an essential condition to quantify the dynamics of seed predation. To measure seed predation, three exclosure treatments (1.2 m radius \u03eb 1.5 m tall) in two forest types (primary vs. secondary forest) were monitored: (1) fenced exclosures that excluded large mammals, (2) fenced exclosures that excluded both large and small mammals, and (3) open controls. Tethered seeds were added from nine common species of canopy trees and lianas (seven families), and seed removal was measured from February 2001 to July 2002. Small rodents had significant negative effects on four of the nine seed species tested, and the effects of small rodents on seed predation differed significantly from the effects of large mammals and insect/fungal pathogens. Small-rodent seed predation (both rates and total proportion destroyed) did not differ between secondary and primary forest habitats. Throughout the exclosure study, small-rodent populations were marked and recaptured to document their community composition and densities. Small-rodent population fluctuations were observed, and shifts in composition directly affected species-specific and community-wide seed predation. Fewer seeds were destroyed when small-rodent abundance was low. Small-rodent population fluctuations also had an indirect effect, reversing the relative importance of small rodents and large mammals and resulting in large mammals becoming the primary seed predators. This change did not only decrease total seed predation for some species; it had the additional effect of moving from a primarily negative interaction (seed predation from the small rodents) to the varied interactions of seed predation and seed dispersal (scatter-hoarding). This research illustrated that small-rodent community fluctuations are a mechanism responsible for variability in the process of Neotropical seedling regeneration.",

Major shifts in an organism's diversity, coexistence, behavior, and recruitment can result from plant-animal interactions across trophic food webs (Lubchenco 1978 , Davidson et al. 1984 , Heske et al. 1994 ). Because plantanimal interactions can be positive and/or negative and are context dependent, research that aims to quantify such direct and indirect interactions is extremely important in determining community dynamics (Janzen 1971, Soul\u00e9 and .",

                "text": "1 E-mail: mede@umich.edu al. 1997 , Curran et al. 1999 , Curran and Leighton 2000 , Curran and Webb 2000 , Howe and Brown 2001 , Schnurr et al. 2002 . While the negative aspect of seed predation by large and small mammals has been well documented, mammalian seed predators can also positively interact with plants via scatter-hoarding and seed caching (VanderWall 1993 , Forget 1993 , 1994 , Adler and Kestell 1998 , Brewer and Rejm\u00e1nek 1999 , and this interplay between the positive and negative effects of mammalian seed predation needs to be quantified. This is especially true in tropical communities due to the diversity of terrestrial seed-eating mammals and the complexity of their food webs (Wright et al. 2000, Brewer and Webb 2001) . In Neotropical forests, terrestrial mammalian seed predators range from the large-bodied white-lipped peccaries (\u03f335 kg) down to small rodents (\u03fd700 g). While many different Neotropical mammalian species contribute to seed predation (Forget 1993 , 1994 , Asquith et al. 1997 , Wright et al. 2000 , Wright and Duber 2001 , to date, few studies have quantified dif- Ecology, Vol. 85, No. 8 ferences in how these groups of seed predators interact. Most empirical research on Neotropical forest seed predation has focused on large terrestrial mammalian seed predators (\u03fe750 g), such as paca (scatter-hoarder), agouti (scatter-hoarder), and peccaries (seed predator) (Forget 1993 , 1994 , Forget et al. 1999 , Asquith et al. 1997 , Wright et al. 2000 , Altrichter et al. 2001 , Wright and Duber 2001 . Fewer studies have described the effects that small rodents have on seed predation, despite their predicted role in potential seed loss in Neotropical forests (Terborgh et al. 1993) . The majority of Neotropical small-rodent seed predation research has focused solely on the medium-bodied Heteromys desmarestianus (46-87 g) or the large-bodied Proechimys semispinosus (320-536 g) (Vandermeer 1979 , Adler and Seamon 1991 , Adler and Kestell 1998 , Lambert and Adler 2000 , Brewer and Webb 2001 . These two species are important seed predators and in some instances seed scatter-hoarders, but Neotropical forests support a diverse rodent community including several other small-and medium-sized rodents from genera such as Peromyscus, Oryzomys, Melanomys, Rhipidomys, Oecomys, Zygodontomys, and Sigmodon (Fleming 1974a , b, Terborgh et al. 1993 , Reid 1997 , Wenny 2000 . Overall, these smaller bodied rodents (8-130 g) are more specialized in their seed consumption and are mainly seedeaters. Because as many as five rodent species (within the Murid family) are found within any Neotropical forest assemblage (Reid 1997) , small-rodent communities have the potential to create a heterogeneous effect on seed predation patterns, and thus, seed survival and seedling recruitment. However, the relative role of the full complement of small rodents within the seed predator guild has not been quantified to date.",

In contrast to these previous studies, this study provides a comprehensive study of mammalian seed predation by examining the entire terrestrial mammalian community and by experimentally manipulating seed predation using seeds across both a size spectrum and from numerous plant families. Moreover, by investigating the effects of small-rodent seed predation combined with that of scatter-hoarding by large mammals, this study examines the direct and indirect interactions between small rodents and large mammals, and their effects on seed fate.",

(2) If habitat (primary vs. secondary forest) does not affect small-rodent diversity and abundance, then small-rodent seed predation rates should be similar across habitats. (3) If large mammals scatter-hoard more frequently than small rodents, then the exclusion of large mammals will increase the proportion of seeds destroyed.

The region, described as tropical wet forest, receives \u03fe5 m of rain annually with the majority of rain falling during the annual rainy season (August-December). The dry season extends from January through March with average rainfall ranging from 10 to 75 mm (Sirena Biological Station, unpublished data). The area supports a forest canopy 30-70 m tall. Given the large area (54 500 ha) and the national park status of CNP, the wildlife has been protected and contains a community of post-dispersal, terrestrial seed predators that has not suffered from local extinctions (including the endangered white-lipped peccary, Dicotyles pecari; Reid 1997: CITES appendix I). This intact mammalian community (Dicotyles pecari, Tayassu tajacu, Dasyprocta punctata, and Agouti paca) provided an ideal system for quantifying the dynamics of small-rodent and large-mammalian seed predation.",

These formerly cultivated lands have been undergoing succession since 1975. The demarcation of both primary and secondary forested habitats was determined using historical information, settlement maps, aerial infrared photographs (Phillips 1989) , and ground-truthed tree censuses. These data on adult tree diversity (DeMattia 2004) coupled with historical land-use information provided an accurate, fine-grained habitat typing for comparison of patterns of small-rodent seed predation in secondary forest and primary forest habitats.",

Platforms were then placed in each treatment, and seeds were monitored on day 1, 2, 7, 14, 21, and 28. After day 28, all seeds and platforms were removed. This sampling design was determined from average germination rates; the majority of seeds were either destroyed or germinated by day 28. This design permitted an evaluation of seed fate: determining whether the seed was moved, eaten (destroyed), buried (scatterhoarded), cached (destroyed), or germinated. Seeds were considered moved if they were \u03fe1 m from the platform. Seeds were considered eaten if more than half of the seed was removed. Buried (scatter-hoarded) seeds were considered any seed that was \u03fe1 m away from the platform and buried just beneath the soil or under leaf litter. Cached seeds, those seeds moved into a burrow and \u03fe10 mm below the soil surface were considered moved and destroyed, as 10 mm was too deep for successful germination to ensue (E. A. DeMattia, personal observation). Insect destruction (e.g., weevils leave exit holes and ants hollow out the seed leaving a thin shell) was noted and can be distinguished from mammal destruction (e.g., signs of gnawing). Most seeds, seed parts, and/or spool-line ends (the part of the string with glue still attached) were located (\u03fe95%).

However, species-specific pairwise comparisons between the LMSR and the SR treatments found that only E. costaricensis displayed a significant decrease in total seed predation when large mammals were excluded (P \u03ed 0.0081; Fig. 1 ).

Once the large-mammal gnaw marks exposed the endocarp, ants (Solenopsis spp.) were able to gain access to the seed and destroy it (a distinctive hollowed out seed with the red, protective coat still present).

Furthermore, this experiment incorporated a range of seed sizes (7.7-44 mm in length), and demonstrated that both large mammals and small rodents were important scatter-hoarders and seed predators for two of the largest seeds in this study (C. racemosa and V. koshnyi) . For the remaining seed species, however, small rodents and ants were the dominant seed predators, demonstrating seed size partitioning (ants and rodents consume smaller seeds than large mammals) similar to that documented for temperate desert communities (Davidson et al. 1984) . This finding is especially important given that, on Barro Colorado Island, Panama (BCI), which is floristically similar to our site, at least 96% of animal dispersed seeds are small (\u03fd1 g; Foster 1996 ). If small rodents and ants are the main predators for the spectrum of smaller seeds, then studies investigating only large mammals overlook critical selective factors, and thus, dynamics of seed fate for the overwhelming majority of plant species. In tropical forests, several levels of food web partitioning occur, and, therefore, future research on tropical seed predation should address the important interactions among large mammals, small rodents, insects, and their food webs.",

In general, predation is typically higher in secondary forests than primary forests (Hammond 1995 , Hammond and Brown 1995 , Notman et al. 1996 , Wright et al. 2000 , Wright and Duber 2001 , Pe\u00f1 a-Claros and de Boo 2002 . However, results presented here demonstrate that small-rodent seed predation (both rates and total proportion destroyed) did not differ significantly in primary and secondary forested habitats. Even though small-rodent seed predation was similar between habitats, canopy tree distributions and fruiting patterns differed significantly between habitats. Reproductive adults for the seed species used in the seed trial experiments were not equally distributed between forest types. Of the seeds used, T. oblongata was found within the secondary forest habitat and one adult V. koshnyi was found in the transition area between forest types. All other seed species were collected within primary forest habitat. Therefore, ambient seed availabilities were not uniform between the forest types, and ''secondary-forest rodents'' may have had less available food and an underdeveloped search image for most of the seeds presented in the seed trials. Yet, seed predation rates by small rodents in both forest types were surprisingly similar, demonstrating that the intensity of small-rodent predation is driven by the demographics of the small-rodent community, not by short-term ambient seed levels. Long-term driving forces behind Neotropical small-rodent community fluctuations may be similar to temperate communities Keesing 2000, Schnurr et al. 2002) , such that fruit production patterns may influence species-specific fluctuations of small-rodent populations (Adler 1998) creating lags or feedback cycles on multiyear intervals.",

                "text": "The community composition of small rodents was found to be a major factor influencing small-rodent seed predation. While total biomass of the small-rodent community remained relatively constant from 2001 to 2002, the community composition shifted from the small-bodied O. talamancae to the larger bodied H. desmarestianus and P. semispinosus. With this change in relative species composition, small-rodent seed predation decreased while seed predation by large mammals and ants increased. Hence, total seed predation within the community fluctuated from domination by small rodents to co-domination by a suite of agents: large mammals, small rodents, and insect/fungal pathogens. Although rarely employed in tropical plant-animal studies (but see Hoch and Adler 1997, Curran and Leighton 2000) , both the biomass and composition of seed predators and their effects on prey (seeds) must be measured concurrently to determine these interactions and the specific context of these dynamics, especially in relatively short-term studies. Brewer and Webb (2001) theorized that seed predation and scatter-hoarding of seeds could ''interact with rodent population dynamics in the recruitment of seedlings.'' The results presented here not only corroborate their idea that small-rodent population fluctuations directly affect seed predation, but also show an indirect effect of small-rodent population fluctuations on seed predation; namely, a switch from small rodents to large mammals as the primary seed predators. This change not only decreases total seed predation for some species, it has the additional effect of moving from a primarily negative interaction (seed predation by the small rodents) to the varied interactions of seed predation (\u03ea) and scatter-hoarding (\u03e9) (Appendix E). This results from large mammals and larger bodied ''small'' rodents (H. desmarestianus and P. semispinosus) scatter-hoarding seeds significantly more than small-bodied ''small'' rodents and thus dispersing, as well as, destroying seeds. In 2001, almost all C. racemosa and V. koshnyi seeds were destroyed (65-100%), and scatter-hoarding by large mammals imparted a relatively small effect (\u03f35%). However, as the small-rodent community moved from small-bodied to large-bodied rodents, small-rodent seed predation decreased and scatter-hoarding activity increased for both small rodents and large mammals (10-25%). This shift from mostly seed predation (a negative interaction on recruitment) to scatter-hoarding (a positive interaction on recruitment) provides a window of opportunity for possible regeneration. In addition, the interplay of scatter-hoarding and seed predation provides variability in the process of seedling regeneration influencing the intensity of recruitment limitation and possibly creating the ''storage effect'' of successful years interspersed with nonsuccessful years for subgroups of plant species, and thus, the mechanism creating recruitment fluctuations critical for maintaining canopy tree species' diversity (Chesson and Warner 1981, Hurtt and Pacala 1995) .",

Such decreased diversity has been viewed primarily as the release from terrestrial mammalian herbivory, decreases in large-mammal scatter-hoarding, and hyper-abundant leaf cutter ant herbivory (Dirzo and Miranda 1991 . However, this study has demonstrated that seedling recruitment is dependent not only on direct large-mammal and insect interactions (scatter-hoarding and herbivory), but also on the interplay between complex direct and indirect effects of scatter-hoarding by large mammals and small-rodent seed predation. As hunting and fragmentation increase, small rodents (which are not hunted) can persist within primary forest fragments and possess the potential for rapid recovery into secondary forested habitat (DeMattia 2004). Conversely, large mammals (with large home ranges) cannot persist in small primary forest fragments, and, therefore, cannot repopulate secondary regrowth habitats (Peres 2001) . Consequently, as tropical forests become increasingly fragmented, the negative interactions between small rodents and seeds will dominate mammalian seed predation, thereby producing seedling carpets of species that are not eaten by small rodents. In this setting, small rodents will have the potential to affect seedling recruitment in fundamental ways, ultimately determining the composition and diversity of Neotropical forests.",
