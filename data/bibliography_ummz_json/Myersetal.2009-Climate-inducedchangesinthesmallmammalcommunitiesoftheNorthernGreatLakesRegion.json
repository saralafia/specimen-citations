    "abstract": "We use museum and other collection records to document large and extraordinarily rapid changes in the ranges and relative abundance of nine species of mammals in the northern Great Lakes region (white-footed mice, woodland deer mice, southern red-backed voles, woodland jumping mice, eastern chipmunks, least chipmunks, southern flying squirrels, northern flying squirrels, common opossums). These species reach either the southern or the northern limit of their distributions in this region. Changes consistently reflect increases in species of primarily southern distribution (white-footed mice, eastern chipmunks, southern flying squirrels, common opossums) and declines by northern species (woodland deer mice, southern red-backed voles, woodland jumping mice, least chipmunks, northern flying squirrels). White-footed mice and southern flying squirrels have extended their ranges over 225 km since 1980, and at particularly well-studied sites in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, small mammal assemblages have shifted from numerical domination by northern species to domination by southern species. Repeated resampling at some sites suggests that southern species are replacing northern ones rather than simply being added to the fauna. Observed changes are consistent with predictions from climatic warming but not with predictions based on recovery from logging or changes in human populations. Because of the abundance of these focal species (the eight rodent species make up 96.5% of capture records of all forest-dwelling rodents in the region and 70% of capture records of all forest-dwelling small mammals) and the dominating ecological roles they play, these changes substantially affect the composition and structure of forest communities. They also provide an unusually clear example of change that is likely to be the result of climatic warming in communities that are experienced by large numbers of people.",

Most studies report changes in phenology; relatively few examine distributions, and most of those that do so are limited to changes in local patterns (Parmesan, 2006) . Most are further restricted to change involving single species; studies that characterize assemblages of organisms are rare (but for notable exceptions involving communities of terrestrial animals, see Wilson et al., 2007; Gonz\u00e1lez-Meg\u00edas et al., 2008; Moritz et al., 2008) . Further, examples of distributional changes by mammals are particularly uncommon, and those that have been published usually involve single species living in extreme or remote environments (e.g. polar bears in the arctic, Stirling & Parkinson, 2006 ; foxes or voles in northernmost Europe, Selas & Vik, 2006; Hornfeldt, 2004 ; pikas on mountains in the Great Basin; Beever et al., 2003) . Consequently, while climatic warming is now widely recognized, its biotic effects often seem remote because accounts of change affecting plant or animal communities across broad regions inhabited by large numbers of people are rare.",

Changes consistently reflect the appearance and/or increasing domination of species whose historical ranges lie mainly to the south of the northern Great Lakes region and the simultaneous waning of northern species. The species involved include several that are very familiar to residents of the eastern and mid-western US. The ecological significance of these changes is unclear, but because some of the commonest species of the region are involved, it is potentially substantial.",

This assemblage includes three species whose ranges are mainly to the south of the northern Great Lakes (white-footed mice, Peromyscus leucopus; eastern chipmunks, Tamias striatus; southern flying squirrels, Glaucomys volans) and five whose ranges are mainly northern (woodland deer mice, Peromyscus maniculatus gracilis; southern red-backed voles, Myodes gapperi; woodland jumping mice, Napaeozapus insignis; northern flying squirrels, Glaucomys sabrinus; least chipmunks, Tamias minimus).

Third, we focused on woodland species because trapping since 1980 has concentrated heavily on forest habitats, and consequently their record is stronger than that of mammal assemblages in other habitats. Fourth, these species are relatively common and frequently captured, often in the same trap-lines. We did not consider a few species that are extremely rare in the region (e.g. woodland voles, Microtus pinetorum) or that seldom enter woodlands (southern bog lemmings, Synaptomys cooperi; meadow voles, Microtus pennsylvanicus; grassland jumping mice, Zapus hudsonius).",

The Huron Mountains are a series of low granitic hills (maximum elevation 600 m) near the Lake Superior shoreline in the central Upper Peninsula of Michigan (Fig. 1 ). Approximately 7300 ha are owned by a private association, the Huron Mountain Club, whose members support research on their property through the Huron Mountain Wildlife Foundation. This area includes a 2600 ha Nature Research Area of primary (never logged) forest. The Huron Mountain Wildlife Foundation has funded three surveys of the mammals of the region. The first, a comprehensive survey of vertebrates by Richard Manville, was carried out from autumn 1939 through summer 1942 (Manville, 1947 (Manville, , 1949 . To sample small mammal populations, Manville set up eight quadrats chosen to represent the habitats of the region. Each quadrat comprised an 11 \u00c2 11 trapping grid (30 ft between traps). Manville used live traps and trapped for five consecutive days four times over the course of the study. He deposited extensive series of voucher specimens in the collections of the University of Michigan Museum of Zoology, and we have confirmed his identifications of Peromyscus. In 1972 -1973 , John Laundre also conducted small mammal censuses in the Huron Mountains, trapping at or near the same locations as Manville and using similar techniques (Laundre, 1975) . Unfortunately, his report does not list numbers of individuals of most species captured, and we are therefore unable to include his records in the analyses of relative abundance reported here. Nor have we been able to locate voucher specimens. His account, however, is useful in documenting the presence/ absence of species in 1972-1973 compared with other time periods. In 2004-2005, the survey was repeated by Allison Poor (2005) . Poor used live-trapping techniques similar to those of Manville and Laundre and located most of her quadrats at or very close to the same sites. Poor, however, trapped for 3 days/sampling period, taking two samples in 2004 and one in 2005. Like Manville, she recorded all captures, and she deposited vouchers (mainly tissue samples) in the University of Michigan Museum of Zoology.",

Of these, 4808 came from museum catalogues and records taken from the literature, and 9268 from our sampling. These records include 4099 captures from 564 localities recorded during the period 1883-1980, and 9977 captures from 591 localities from 1981 to 2007. The focal SFRs make up 96.5% of all captures of forest-dwelling rodents (including tree squirrels and rare species) and 70% of all captures of forest-dwelling small mammals (including the above species plus shrews and moles). For opossums, we included 94 capture records from MaNIS, 163 records from a survey of road-killed animals carried out in 1968 (Brocke, 1970) , and 281 records from a similar survey done in 2006-2008. Range shifts were discovered by visual inspection of trapping records. If changes in range are due to climatic warming, they should be in the direction of species of southern affiliation moving into regions previously occupied by species of northern affiliation. In the Lower Peninsula populations affected by climatic warming will move northward, while in the Upper Peninsula, movement will be constrained by geography to northward and eastward. Documenting changes in abundance is complex. Discovering that fewer specimens of a particular species were trapped at one time compared with another appears to suggest a change in abundance, but it may simply result from fewer traps being set during the later period. Unfortunately, trapping effort (the number of traps set in obtaining a sample at a locality) is seldom known for collections before 1980. We therefore compared communities in two ways. We calculated the abundance of each species relative to other SFRs as (number of species A captured)/(total number of SFRs captured). We refer to this value as the 'relative abundance' of a species. We grouped collections geographically according to their origin (Upper vs. northern Lower Peninsula, Fig. 1 ) and for each region, compared the relative abundance of SFRs in collections made before and after 1980. Significance of difference was tested using w 2 -analyses, where the expected value for species A was calculated as (number of species A captured) \u00c2 (total number of SFRs captured in that interval)/(total number of SFRs captured).",

Even if this is not the case, collectors may preserve or report at least a few specimens of each species (especially when the object of collecting is determining the species present in a local fauna, as was often the case in the oldest and most recent collections, Appendix A). If so, examining occurrence data for each collection -whether a species is detected at all at a locality during a particular time period -may reveal changes that might otherwise be hidden. To simplify tabulating data, we defined a 'collection' to be an aggregate of records from one locality taken during a single year. This was the work of a single collector in almost all instances in the dataset of specimen records used here. We restricted our attention to collections that included 10 or more specimens of SFRs, and for each collection we determined whether any individual of each species of SFR was reported. Collections were grouped geographically (northern Lower Peninsula vs. Upper Peninsula) and by the year of the collection (before or after 1980). Using contingency tables, we then asked, for each region and species, if the probability of occurrence of each species in a collection was independent of time period, and if not, if changes in occurrence reflected the same pattern as that suggested by the analysis of relative abundance. Significance of differences between expected and observed values was calculated using Fisher's exact tests (two-sided).",

In Michigan, the earliest range map (Osgood, 1909) shows their northern limit transecting the northern Lower Peninsula, but museum specimens from 1909 suggest that by then white-footed mice already occupied the northernmost parts of the peninsula. Currently, they are common or abundant in appropriate habitat throughout the Lower Peninsula. In the Upper Peninsula, whitefooted mice were absent or rare before 1981 except in the southernmost county, Menominee (Fig. 1) , where their record of occurrence began in 1939 with the first collections made there (early reports of two individuals captured in the eastern Upper Peninsula are discussed below). Trapping by S. Meagher in the early 1990s (specimens and field notes in the University of Michigan Museum of Zoology) resulted in the discovery of a population of this species 70 km northeast of Menominee localities. In 1999, a small number of whitefooted mice were discovered an additional 50 km to the northeast on the western side of the Seney National Wildlife Refuge, and over the next 4 years they extended their distribution 25 km to the eastern side of the Refuge (documented by yearly trapping). In 2004, two populations were located in the eastern Upper Peninsula near St Ignace, a total expansion of 225 km eastward. During this interval, we sampled at many additional sites in the eastern Upper Peninsula without finding white-footed mice. In 2004, a population was discovered in the Hiawatha National Forest north of St Ignace, and by 2006, white-footed mice were the commonest mammals recorded at some sites in the eastern Upper Peninsula and along the Lake Superior shoreline. Over the same period , populations were also discovered in the central and western Upper Peninsula (Fig. 2, top) .

In the northern Lower Peninsula, woodland deer mice have declined almost five-fold in relative abundance, from 28% of forest rodent captures to 5.9% before and after 1981 (Table 1a ; see also Myers et al., 2005) . In fact, a goal of many recent collecting efforts has been to locate populations of this declining species. Collectors have concentrated on appropriate habitat, so the latter figure (5.9%) may be inflated. The frequency of collections containing deer mice has declined as well; before 1981 they were recorded in 71.4% of collections; after, in only 26.3% (Table 2a ). Woodland deer mice remain common in the Upper Peninsula, where their relative abundance in 1883-1980 1981-2006 1883-1980 1981-2006 (a) collections has actually increased and the frequency of finding them in collections has not changed appreciably (Tables 1b and 2b ). In the focused collecting in the Huron Mountains, however, where the same sites were sampled in 1940-1942 and 2003-2005 , the contribution of deer mice to SFR communities declined sharply from 65.6% to 35.8% of captures (Table 1c ; Poor, 2005) .",

Small populations were next discovered in the cities of Marquette and Houghton in the late 1960s and early 1970s (summarized by Wells-Gosling, 1982) . Wells-Gosling suggested that these populations might have been founded by escaped pets, but reports of southern flying squirrels in a wilderness area (Crider, 1979) and in the Huron Mountains (Wells-Gosling, 1982) suggest that the species also spread naturally. They have now been found approximately 225 km northeast of their pre-1960s range limit (Fig. 3, top) . This is strikingly similar to the recent 200 km northward movement of this species in Ontario (Bowman et al., 2005) .",

This increase is due primarily to an increase in the abundance of white-footed mice accompanied by a decrease in the relative contribution of deer mice and southern red-backed voles. In the Upper Peninsula, between 1883 and 1980 just 8.3% of captures of forest rodents were of southern species (Fig. 5, middle) . That percentage almost tripled (24.8%) after 1981. Four of four southern species have increased, and four out of five northern species have declined (deer mice show a small but statistically significant increase). Southern species have become a significant component of northern forest communities where they were rare or absent 25 years ago. Occurrence analyses of localities with at least 10 captures show a similar pattern. In the northern Lower Peninsula before 1981, trapping at 66.7% of these localities (14 out of 21) resulted in the capture of at least one southern SFR species.

Because the limitations of museum records require that we base comparisons on the % contribution of each species to the SFR community, we cannot answer this question for most sites. In the Huron Mountains, however, the same seven trapping grids (121 trap stations/grid) were sampled in 1940-1941 by Richard again in 2004-2005 by Allison Poor, though a difference in trapping effort means that actual capture numbers from the two periods are not directly comparable (see 'Materials and methods'). Manville (1947) , however, reported daily trapping success (total number of new captures of all species on each day of trapping) for two grids. On both grids, trapping for three nights produced 71-72% of the five-night total. We used 72% to weight Manville's site totals for all seven grids and compared the adjusted totals to the totals from 2004 to 2005 (Table 3) . The results show no tendency for the total small mammal numbers on these sites to be higher now than in 1940-1941, despite the addition of white-footed mice and southern flying squirrels to the fauna.

Relative abundance analyses reveal changes in abundance relative to other species but cannot reveal changes in absolute abundance. They assume that all specimens captured have been recorded. Second, we performed occurrence analyses. These analyses examine only the presence/absence of a species in a collection (we restricted our attention to collections that included at least 10 SFRs).

It is likely that expanding populations of mice have followed corridors of favorable habitat, which were sometimes sampled by collectors and undoubtedly, sometimes missed. Thus, a species may be present in an area and even locally common for some time before it is discovered. Further, while finding a species at a site is unambiguous evidence of its presence, only repeated, intensive sampling can determine its absence. Few sites have been sampled this intensively.

These records suggest the possibility that the apparent range increase of these species may actually represent the rapid recent expansion of pre-existing, but rare and seldom detected, populations. An alternative explanation for the anomalous records is transport by humans. White-footed mice in particular often inhabit human homes and storage areas, and the early records of this species were of individuals captured near towns along major travel routes. The early Upper Peninsula record of an opossum is harder to explain; as far as we can determine, opossums do not currently occur in northern Wisconsin or in the northwestern Upper Peninsula of Michigan.

Fire control and regulation of logging have since resulted in extensive forest regeneration, with substantial increases both in the area covered by forests and forest maturity (Dickman & Leefers, 2003) . The return of forest conditions may have contributed to these faunal changes, but it is not by itself an adequate explanation of them. The forests of this region continue to be harvested, and the landscape is a patchwork of forest stands of different successional stages. The newly dominating southern species of mammals are by no means restricted to mature ecotypes, and in fact white-footed mice are common residents of recently harvested or burned forests in other parts of their range (e.g. Greenberg et al., 2006) . Further, the changes we report here hold true for an extensive area of never-harvested forest in the Huron Mountains. There, forest structure and composition have changed minimally over the last 100 years, yet white-footed mice, southern flying squirrels, and eastern chipmunks are now common (Poor, 2005) .",

The affected small mammal communities inhabit a broad spectrum of forest types, from fencerows and small woodlots around farms and in suburban areas to extensive tracts of primary forest. Second, comparable faunal changes have taken place in both the northern Lower Peninsula and the Upper Peninsula, areas with human populations of very different characteristics. In the northern Lower Peninsula, the number of human residents has increased by 127% since 1950 and by almost 40% since 1980. In 2005, the population density was estimated to be 46.9 persons mi \u00c02 . In the Upper Peninsula, the number of humans has increased by only 4.1% since 1950, and between 1980 and 2005 it actually declined by 1.6%. Human density in 2005 was estimated to be 19.3 persons mi \u00c02 (Adams et al., 2006; US Census Bureau, 2007) .

The pattern of growing importance of southern species and declining northern ones is similar across the Upper and northern Lower Peninsulas.

Climatic warming, and in particular the earlier arrival of spring in recent years, may be responsible for the replacement of woodland deer mice by white-footed mice in the northern Lower Peninsula (Myers et al., 2005) , and variation in weather from year to year may allow the two species to coexist in Appalachian communities (Wolff, 1996) . Winter temperatures may limit the distribution of southern flying squirrels (Weigl, 1978; Bowman et al., 2005) , and warmer winters may allow the persistence of a nematode parasite that is fatal to northern flying squirrels but harmless to the southern species (Pauli et al., 2004) .",

We detect no obvious geographic pattern to this variation; differences in temperatures and their pattern of increase over time are probably due to differences in exposure, wind, presence of water, vegetative cover, etc. of measurement sites. Measurements of both temperature and the composition of SFR assemblages would need to be made on a very local scale in order to apply, for example, predictive distribution modelling techniques to test the importance of temperature in determining community structure.

Collector bias -properly identified and georeferenced collections might still provide a misleading picture of community composition: Collecting is usually done for a particular purpose. Collectors sometimes have the goal of determining species composition and abundance in a community, and they record everything they capture. Collectors are often, however, looking for particular species or sampling particular habitats. They may or may not take exemplars of other species or record them in their notes. If specimens are taken, their numbers are likely to be biased in favor of the species under study. Collectors are also likely to keep or report specimens that surprise them because they represent rare or unexpected finds, while perhaps under-representing or ignoring common species. They sometimes take only 'vouchers,' specimens placed in collections to document the presence and identification of a particular species at a locality. Collection of vouchers is seldom done in the context of community composition. Further, collections may be biased geographically. Areas that are easily accessible or particularly attractive may be over-represented, while remote or, at the opposite extreme, heavily urban areas are often less frequently collected.",

This assumption is met by post-1980 collections but perhaps not by some earlier ones, Consequently, we further compared the results of relative abundance analyses to 'occurrence analyses' that require only that collectors report the presence of each species captured (see ' Materials and methods' and 'Discussion,') .

We cannot be certain that, for example, the abundance of white-footed mice in collections (38% of the SFRs captured before 1980) means that they made up precisely 38% of the actual SFR community.

Assessing and correcting error, insofar as possible, is a difficult and time-consuming process, but it is essential; records such as these cannot simply be downloaded and incorporated into research (Williams et al., 2002; Chapman, 2005a) . Further, when error is suspected but cannot be checked, it is important to consider what effect it might have on an analysis. Error that is unbiased with respect to the questions being considered is less of a problem than error that systematically skews an analysis one way or another. Unbiased error may make patterns harder to detect or obscure them entirely, but it is unlikely to create patterns where none exist.Our goals in this paper are to identify distributional shifts and changes in local assemblages of small mammals and to discuss possible causes of change. With respect to those goals and the particular collections on which we relied, we addressed the following areas of uncertainty with regard to each record:1. problems with species identifications, 2. problems associated with the precision of location, and 3. collector bias -why properly identified and georeferenced collections might still provide a misleading picture of community composition.1. Problems with species identifications: Most small mammal species in the northern Great Lakes region are fairly easy to identify in the field or as museum specimens, but among the forest rodents on which we focus, field identification of two pairs (Peromyscus, woodland deer mice and white-footed mice; Glaucomys, southern flying squirrels and northern flying squirrels) is sometimes difficult. For museum records, we examined and verified the identifications of all specimens that suggested significant changes in distribution. For field records, since 1980 almost all field identifications were made by the authors or by assistants trained by us. Identifications of most questionable Peromyscus were confirmed by electrophoretic examination of salivary amylase alleles (Aquadro & Patton, 1980) or restriction fragment length polymorphism (Poor, 2005) .2. Problems associated with the precision of location: Coordinates for localities associated with our field work (post-1980 records) were either georeferenced directly using GPS units, or located on maps (usually to quarterquarter section) and later georeferenced using Topozone (http://www.topozone.com) and/or Google Earth (http://earth.google.com).For most other specimens, localities, including (when available) latitude, longitude, and estimated coordinate error, were downloaded from http://www.manisnet. org/. For localities that were missing coordinates and/or estimates of coordinate uncertainty, we used Topozone, Google Earth, and an assortment of local maps to supply",
