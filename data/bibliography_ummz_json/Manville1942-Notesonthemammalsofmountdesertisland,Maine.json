Bailey (1925) , in an unpublished manuscript, lists thirty species. Twitchell and Crockett (1925) merely enumerate four species iPeromuecue, Clethrionomys, Glaucomys, and Tamiasciurus). Johnson (1927) reports experimental studies on Peromyscus, Clethrionomys, and Microtus. Stupka (1932-35) has recorded many observations oil the island mammals in a mimeographed bulletin. Branin (1936, a and b) in two papers has discussed Zapus and Napaeozapus; and in another paper (1939) gives an annotated list of twelve kinds of small mammals trapped on the Island. Excavations of old Indian sites along the coast of Maine have yielded remains of earlier mammals, In the Mount Desert Island region, Wyman (1868) has unearthed bones of wolf, beaver, deer, and elk; and Moorehead (1922) reports the gray seal (Halichoerus), the Indian dog, and sea mink, as well as large numbers of raccoon, lynx, wolf, muskrat, and deer.",

Subsequently many skeletal remains have been recovered from old Indian sites along the Maine coast, including Boynton's shell heap at Lamoine, across Frenchman's Bay from the island, as described by Moorehead (1922) . The formal descriptionof this species prompted Hardy (1903) , of Brewer, Maine, to write a short account of it. Asone of the chief fur-traders in Maine, over 50,000 mink skins had passed through his hands. He recognized asa distinct form a very large mink, skins of which were received from the Indians of the Penobscot and Jericho Bay regions until about 1860, and believed it to be this species. This large form 'was most highly developed on Swan's and Marshall's islands.",

Deer are known to cross to the mainland, but so few do that this cannot be of much importance in reducing their population on the island. Among their favorite foods on the island are American yew, mountain ash, red maple, and white cedar; several persons report that \u2022they definitely prefer old to young cedar browse. Mating was reported by Mr. Dow, at the Mount Desert Nurseries, on the night of November 8, 1934. Albino deer have been seen repeatedly in several distant sections of the island. Specimens examined: ANP, 2.",

Tracy's uncle, Charles Clemont, recalled tales of boys collecting moose antlers shed in a winter yard at Hunter's Beach Brook. This would go back more than 100 years. There are frequent reports of vagrant moose on the island. One such report, apparently authentic, was of two moose landing on the shore near Duck Brook, about 1920, and breaking the glass in greenhouses there; they crossed the island and were last seen near Seal Cove.",

Chipmunk.-This is one of the most commonly observed mammals on the island. It frequents hardwood and coniferous forests, us well as meadows and the shores of fresh and salt water. Many are killed by automobiles. Altitudinally it ranges from sea level to the summit of Cadillac Mountain. The earliest spring appearance of the chipmunk was noted by Vernon Lunt on March 19, 1934; the latest fall occurrence, as noted by O. Y.Thompson, was on November 23, 1934. Autumn specimens had in their cheek pouches fruits of the following plants, as determined by Stupka: striped maple, sugar maple, red oak, and Viburnum cassinoidee, Two specimens taken on September 9 and October 2, 1934, by Louis R. Fowler had in their cheek pouches, respectively, 102 and 168 seeds of the striped maple, with the blades removed. Specimens examined: ANP, 3; UIVIMZ, 3.Tamiasciurus hudsonicus gymnicus Bangs. Red squirrel c-c-The red squirrel is abundant over the entire island, where it occurs mainly in coniferous forests. It ranges from sea level to the summits of several of the mountains. Globular outside nests are common. These are usually made of the Usnea lichens, as well as the loose bark of white cedar. Specimens examined: ANP, 3; UMMZ, 3.Sciurus carolinensis leucotis Gapper. Gray squirrel.-1.\"his squirrel was probably not an original inhabitant of Mount Desert Island, although Joe Tracy reports seeing one at Indian Point about 1898. The present population dates from the spring of 1922, when captive specimens at Sieur de Monts Spring were released by George B. Dorr. 'I'hey now range at least over the eastern half of the island. In 1933 Thompson and Smith estimated an increasing population of twenty on the island. Of the five specimens seen, four were killed by automobiles, one by dogs.
