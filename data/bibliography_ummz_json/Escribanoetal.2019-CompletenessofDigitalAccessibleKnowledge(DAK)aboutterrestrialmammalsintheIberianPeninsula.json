    "abstract": "The advent of online data aggregator infrastructures has facilitated the accumulation of Digital Accessible Knowledge (DAK) about biodiversity. Despite the vast amount of freely available data records, their usefulness for research depends on completeness of each body of data regarding their spatial, temporal and taxonomic coverage. In this paper, we assess the completeness of DAK about terrestrial mammals distributed across the Iberian Peninsula. We compiled a dataset with all records about mammals occurring in the Iberian Peninsula available in the Global Biodiversity Information Facility and in the national atlases from Portugal and Spain. After cleaning the dataset of errors as well as records lacking collection dates or not determined to species level, we assigned all occurrences to a 10-km grid. We assessed inventory completeness by calculating the ratio between observed and expected richness (based on the Chao2 richness index) in each grid cell and classified cells as wellsampled or under-sampled. We evaluated survey coverage of well-sampled cells along four environmental gradients and temporal coverage. Out of 796,283 retrieved records, quality issues led us to remove 616,141 records unfit for this use. The main reason for discarding records was missing collection dates. Only 25.95% cells contained enough records to robustly estimate completeness. The DAK about terrestrial mammals from the Iberian Peninsula was low, and spatially and temporally biased. Out of 5,874 cells holding data, only 620 (9.95%) were classified as well-sampled. Moreover, well-sampled cells were geographically aggregated and reached inventory completeness over the same temporal range. Despite the increasing availability of DAK, its usefulness is still compromised by quality issues and gaps in data. Future work should therefore focus on increasing data quality, in addition to mobilizing unpublished data.",

Biodiversity data exchange infrastructures such as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) facilitate access to massive amounts of primary biodiversity data records (PBR) which become digital accessible knowledge (DAK [4] ; also referred to as digital accessible information or DAI [5] ). However, the unprecedented availability of digital PBR still seems insufficient to overcome existing biodiversity information gaps [5] [6] [7] . Data portals usually aggregate smaller datasets derived from local surveys designed for a specific purpose. GBIF, the largest portal, enabled access to more than one billion (10 9 ) PBR in 40,521 datasets as of August 2018. Taxonomic, spatial and temporal gaps arise inevitably from the nature of these data aggregators [8] .",

Therefore, we established a minimum number of records per cell to calculate the estimators. This minimum was established by assessing the relationship between C c and number of records, following Sousa-Baena et al. [4] . For the generation of the species accumulation curves (SAC), we used the function 'speccacum' (method = 'exact') in the R package vegan [34] , and then we obtained the slope of the final 10% of the SAC. Values close to zero (flat slopes) indicated high completeness (saturation of the curve almost reached) whereas higher values (steeper slopes) indicated low completeness [15] . We plotted the completeness values based on C c vs. C m to test whether they were correlated. As the analysis showed high correlation for the full dataset (r Spearman: -0.60, p value < 0.001, Fig B in S1 Appendix) we chose to use C c . Finally, we classified the cells as well-sampled or under-sampled based according to two criteria, strict (high-threshold) and lax (low-threshold), based on thresholds used in previous studies but adapted to data availability [17] . Well-sampled cells for the strict criterion required having more than 50 records and a value of C c equal to or greater than 0.8, while the lax criterion identified well-sampled cells as having more than 25 records and a value of C c equal to or greater than 0.7.

First, a coarse search in GBIF yielded more than a half-million occurrence data records from Spain and Portugal. Successive quality, suitability and reliability checks filtered out the majority of these data, and only 16.01% were deemed suitable for representativeness analysis on both the space and time dimensions. On the other hand, raw data collected from the national atlases yielded less than half as many records, of which 22.23% were fit for our purpose. Although the leakage rate [40] was thus higher in the case of the GBIF, overall, we observed comparable retention of records in both datasets as well as similar factors leading to attrition. The main reason for discarding records was data quality. While having partial data still allows records to be used for specific purposes, we needed complete records in our analysis. The lack of collection dates was the largest cause of leakage from GBIF and Spanish atlas data (Fig 1) . The Portuguese atlas data had fewer data quality issues, but had a much larger proportion of records with inadequate distribution data that were removed first (Fig 1) , and the collection dates were merely specified as before or after the year 2000.",

Errors such as misspelled species, or occurrences mismatching the expected territory for a record (e.g., political divisions) can be relatively easy to track and correct [44] . However, other errors such as wrong dates can easily go unnoticed and in many cases cannot be corrected although they could be detected (for example, misrepresenting unknown day of the month or month of the year [45] , an anomalous concentration of records on the first day of each month or year). In our case, the coincidence of the publication date of the Spanish national atlas and a single batch of 179,757 observation records from 2007 found in the GBIF dataset led us to discover that those records had been assigned the atlas' publication year rather than the actual occurrence dates. We were thus able to remove these GBIF records from the dataset, substituting them with the raw data. However, this type of detailed intervention may be difficult to accomplish when working with very large datasets, where these time-consuming checks for errors and inconsistencies [46] can easily become cost-ineffective. Thus, it is of utmost importance that data publishers provide accurate data and comprehensive metadata to inform data users about the true limitations of the data [40] .",

Overall, these assessments tend to conclude that inventory completeness is spatially biased. We found that to be also the case for mammals in the Iberian Peninsula. Our analysis showed that DAK completeness was low, and spatially and temporally biased. Despite the relatively high proportion of territory cells holding data at the chosen spatial resolution, the number of records per cell was low ( Fig 2B) . The lax criterion excluded 90.05% of the cells from the full dataset. Well-sampled cells tended to be geographically aggregated, particularly in the western and eastern edges of the Pyrenees, the Mediterranean coast and one spot in the midwest of Spain (Fig 2A) . Several causes might account for the comparatively high level of inventory in those areas, such as local atlases, research projects, or citizen science. When splitting the dataset by taxonomic groups, the spatial distribution of well-sampled cells for both groups did not substantially differ from the full dataset (Fig 2) . DAK about non-small mammals seemed to be higher than that for small mammals in the Iberian Peninsula (e.g., 531 wellsampled cells compared to 205 using the lax criterion). Still, the overall completeness was very low.",

We observed that records peaked at the start of the 21st century, but the inventorying activity decreased thence. One possible cause for the recent decrease in number of records might be the lag between data collection and data mobilization [53] although other causes could also be possible, such as an actual reduction in field campaigns or data collection, or possibly the processing of the backlog of natural history collections data [54] . The temporal pattern of inventorying was similar among taxonomic groups, even though they peaked at different times (Fig 4) . The high inventorying of small mammals (Rodentia and Soricidae) during the later years of the 20th century in the western side of the Pyrenees (Figs 2G and 4 ) was driven by the publication of the extensive regional atlas for the province of Navarra [55] . Similarly, the publication of the Spanish national atlas resulted in a distinct increase in the number of records (Fig 4) .",

Nonetheless, we are aware that many data may be still locked away [56, 57] . Our results show not only a map of the inventory completeness of the mammals but also the areas where biodiversity data have been made digitally accessible. As the concentration areas tend to coincide with the political boundaries of a few, selected Spanish administrative divisions, it is quite likely that data exist as well in other regions within Spain that have not yet been mobilized through digital platforms and, thus, are not part of the DAK. However, unless scientific community and administrations incorporate the publication of data as a routine step in their workflow [58] , access to data will continue to rely on the will of data holders to invest their resources to doing so.",

Such effort involved in collecting data could be wasted if all the potential in the resulting data are not put to full use by properly converting them into DAK. We believe that releasing all the compiled information is a desirable and highly valuable step forward for research and conservation. As pointed out in several studies, data gathered in databases can be relevant for designing new and more efficient sampling protocols [59] even if the source of information is biased or scarce [11] .",

Obtaining a better understanding of the species distributional and temporal patterns requires filling the existing information gaps, both positive and negative. While some gaps will surely be impossible to fill due to lack of surveys, much information from actual surveys may still remain to be discovered, debugged and published. Such data would allow us to fill historical gaps and to design better surveys to fill contemporary gaps. However, the volume of data by itself is not always a surrogate of increased knowledge [5, 40] . We call for significant efforts to be made to increase the quality of the shared data, thus enlarging their fitness-for-use spectrum. The present and future of biodiversity research and conservation rely on freely available data. Good and sufficient data availability may facilitate better allocation of limited resources for research. With the release of that data we might be better prepared to understand changes in distributional patterns of species, and to answer questions when dealing with the biodiversity crisis we are facing.",
