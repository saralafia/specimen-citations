Owl pellets found inside the cave entrance contained skeletal remains of Tadarida. The owls, when flushed, always left the cave and perched several hundred yards south of the cave entrance in a juniper overlooking the ravine which the bats follow on their exit flight. On 15 Sep. 1979, the exit flight began at 1845 during twilight. One of the owls approached the swarm of bats from behind but on a parallel path. The owl glided into the center of the bat swarm, singled out a bat, reached out with its talons and captured it. For approximately another half hour no more attacks by the owls were noted. Looney (1972) observed a Barn Owl using tactics similar to the Great Horned Owl. It dropped from a cliff overlooking the entrance of a bat cave and flew parallel with and into the emerging bat column, singling out and catching bats from behind. The owl captured seven bats in 45 min.",

Owl pellets found inside the cave entrance contained skeletal remains of Tadarida. The owls, when flushed, always left the cave and perched several hundred yards south of the cave entrance in a juniper overlooking the ravine which the bats follow on their exit flight. On 15 Sep. 1979, the exit flight began at 1845 during twilight. One of the owls approached the swarm of bats from behind but on a parallel path. The owl glided into the center of the bat swarm, singled out a bat, reached out with its talons and captured it. For approximately another half hour no more attacks by the owls were noted. Looney (1972) observed a Barn Owl using tactics similar to the Great Horned Owl. It dropped from a cliff overlooking the entrance of a bat cave and flew parallel with and into the emerging bat column, singling out and catching bats from behind. The owl captured seven bats in 45 min.",
