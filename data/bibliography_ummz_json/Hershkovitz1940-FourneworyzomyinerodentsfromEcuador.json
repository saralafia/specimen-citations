The renewal of pelage progresses along the sides to the posterior parts, thence to the dorsal surface. Thus, in many specimens, the old pelage in the region of the thighs and posterior half of the dorsum, especially the rump, is contrastingly darker in color than that of the anterior parts. The extent of the bicolored part of the tail varies from the proximal one-sixth in one specimen, to the complete length of the tail in another specimen. In some specimens the hairs on the throat and midline of the chest tend to be more nearly white than those on the other parts of the ventral surface. Five of the eighteen topotypes are marked by spots and patches of white distributed irregularly over the head, back, and sides. None of the specimens from La Carolina exhibits this variegation. The coloration of the dorsal surface and sides averages darker in the La Carolina series than in the topotypes.",

Thomas (1926a: 611) synonymized stolzmanni with.minutus Tomes and subsequently referred all the Peruvian Oligoryzomys, except arenalis, to minutus. He implied (1926b: 160) that andinus Osgood was identical with minutus. Later, in reporting on a collection of mammals from Peru, (1927: 369) he concluded that Oryzomyslongicaudatus destructor Tschudi \"with which his [Tschudi's] melanostoma was synonymous, would seem to be the proper term for the Peruvian mouse commonly called minutus or stolzmanni.\" In addition, Thomas expressed his belief that \"the Peruvian longtailed mice are not specifically distinguishable from the O. longicaudatus of Chili, of which they may best be treated as a local sub-species.\" As a result, he thereafter listed all the eastern Peruvian Oligoryzomys under O. longicaudatus destructor.",

As for stolzmanni and melanostoma, Thomas gave no grounds for referring them to destructor. The inference is that Thomas adopted the latter name simply because it is the oldest. Although it is true that the described forms of the eastern Peruvian Oligoryzomys bear a high degree of resemblance to each other and to spodiurus, there are differences in characters which are here considered to be of sufficient importance to separate them. If, as stated by Thomas, destructor is a race of longicaudatus, the form stolzmanni must equally be considered a distinct race of the same species. The Ecuadorian spodiurus may likewise be shown to be referable to longicaudatus. However, no specimens of typicallongicaudatus are at hand for comparison, therefore, to avoid arbitrariness, I am provisionally giving O. spodiurus specific rank.",

Concerning the specimens of destructor, Osgood advises (in epist.) that these were taken in the vicinity of Tschudi's home in Peru. Tschudi (1844: 184) remarked that he found a pair of these mice nesting in a chest in which he had kept his natural history collection during a period of several months. According to Tschudi, destructor is the house mouse of the plantations which border on the virgin forests of eastern Peru. Taking this as an indication of the type locality, it is obviously within the zone which Tschudi (1844: xxviii) describes as the \"Eigentliche Waldregion\" and which includes also the localities in the Rio Chinchao district where the specimens at hand were collected. Furthermore, these mice agree closely with the original description of destructor and with the color plate of the type (1844: 182, pl. XIV, fig. 1 ). These considerations make it necessary to regard the Chinchao specimens as destructor. It appears from Tschudi's description (1844: 182, pI. XIV, fig. 2) that melanostoma is a distinct form.

Osgood (1933: 6) remarked that \"minuiue altissimus\" and minutus aurillus had been taken in the same general 10cality, but he qualified this by stating that these forms were trapped at different stations, the former on the open puna, the latter in the edge of the forest below the puna. He further remarked that in other places, in northern Peru and in Ecuador, these two forms were found under the same conditions, i.e., the one in the open country, the other in the adjacent forests. However, my two specimens of hylaeus were taken in the same trap line that yielded specimens of minutus. This trap line was set at the edge of a small cornfield entirely surrounded by virgin forest. Thus, it is conclusively shown that both altissimus and minutus can be found in exactly the same habitat and that at least one race of the former is a forest-dweller.",
