It was demonstrated that in S. xerampelinus, which is restricted to high and typically cloud-enshrouded mountains, the optic foramen is smaller than in S. teguina, an inhabitant of lower warmer habitats. The eyeball, lens and optic nerve also were reported to be smaller in xerampelinus, but those observations were not adequately documented by the few and poorly preserved specimens then available.",

After the skin, including the eyelid, was removed from the right side of the head, the exposed eyeball was measured. Then, for measurement of the optic nerve, the intraorbital lacrimal and Harderian glands were extracted, the nerve cut transversely, and the eye with nerve stalk removed. An incision around the iris released the solidified lens, which was then cleared of attached tissues before it was transferred to a glass well for measurement. Throughout these procedures the specimens were moistened or immersed in FAA. Measurements were obtained by means of a calibrated moveable stage on a Wild binocular microscope. All measurements are transverse diameters. Of the three sets of measurements (Table 1) , those of the lens, hardened by preservatives, are most easily determined and reliable. Those of the optic nerve are unsatisfactory because the techniques for sectioning and measuring it were too imprecise for an object of that size and texture. In samples of 14 specimens of each species, mean diameters of the nerve are identical (Table 1) .",

Ratios of lens to eyeball are similar in the two species; transverse diameter of lens is approximately 70 percent of that of eyeball, as measured here. The lens increases in size with age, with the result that old examples of xerampelinus may have larger lenses than young teguina. In the 40 examples (18 xerampelinus, 22 teguina) for which there are data, however, there is little overlap of the species at comparable age levels (Fig. 2) . Relationships of lens dimensions to age in various mammals are discussed by Fisher and Peny (1970) , Erickson et al. (1970) , King (1965) , and others. (Green, 1955; Hummel et al., 1966) . Closely associated with the crescentric black nictitating membrane, and opening on it, is the Harderian gland. Although it occupies a large part of the orbit, only a small part of this large gland is visible externally (Fig. 1 ). Most of it lies deep to the intraorbital lacrimal and partly surrounds the optic nerve. Streaks of pigment, in various amounts among the specimens, were visible in the connective tissue enclosing the gland. The two lacrimal glands are conspicuous subcutaneous bodies (Fig. 1) . The triangularshaped intraorbital lacrimal gland essentially fills that part of the temporal fossa which is situated between the temporal muscle and eye and superficial to the Harderian gland. Thin dorsal and ventral lobes border the posterior half of the eye. The lobate exorbital lacrimal gland, about equal to the parotid gland in width, extends from the base of the ear ventrad to the submaxillary glands near the midventral line of the skulL Its duct arises on the inner face of the dorsal part of the gland, passes anterodorsally, and opens with the intraorbital ducts on the outer canthus of the lid.",

Thus, both the eyeball and the lens are absolutely and proportionaIiy smaller in xerampelinus, the slightly larger animal.

A large eye in nocturnal species serves to admit more light, and thereby to brighten the image and permit the animal to see at low light intensity. A large eye in diurnal foons is associaled with enlargement of the image and resolution of detail. High resolving power (visual acuity) is associated with agility, swiftness of movement and scansorial habits. Since absolute dimensions of the eye (that is, number of visual cells per linear distance on the retina) detennines acuity as well as the amount of light reaching the retina, a larger eye, with larger retinal area, should yield higher resolution of detail. So little is known of the histology and performancc of the eye among small mammals, however, that few if any generalizations may bc made relating dimensions of the eye to vision in the animal. King and associates (1965; 1974; Rahmann et al., 1968) in their work with several species of PeromysC!ls, for example, could not relate observed differences in visual acuity and in visual distance to any of the morphological parts of the eye they measured, nor to the species' habitats.",

Both species are diurnal, terrestrial, and mainly or entirely insectivorous. Activity extends from daylight to dark, is concentrated in the morning: and tapers off in the afternoon. The animals live among roots, logs, grass and other lowgrowing vegetation in moist to wet montane forests and clearings. Light intensi!\"~' in their microhabitats is moderately low, and is probably lower where xerampelinus livcs (terrain enshrouded with mist and clouds for most of the year). In this small-eyed species, vision appears to be less acute on the basis of subjective laboratory observations. These animals, in contrast to those of teguina, are less responsive to visual cues, are slower in movements, more tractable, and less aggressive. They appear to rely more on olfaction in detecting their laboratOlY prey-mealworms (Tenebrio sp.) and crickets (Gryllus sp.). When searching for food they commonly \"test the air,\" with elevated or lowered head and twitching nose. Individuals of teguina, on the other hand, appear to rely more strongly on sight, initially detecting movement of their prey and then seizing it. They seem more facile at capturing mobile items (for example crickets) than does xerampelimH.",

S. teguina, inhabiting areas of higher light intensities than xerampelinus, may be subjected to stronger selection for visual acuity in obtaining its prey. Conversely, olfaction is more strongly selected for in xerampelinlls, given its environment. At the same time, the larger eyes, probably more acute vision, quick movements, and aggressive behavior seen in teguina should convey adaptive advantage against predators. More species of mouse-eating snakes, birds, and mammals occur in the subtropical environment where teguina lives than in the temperate highlands inhabited by xerampelinus. It is thus proposed that teguina has more predators than xerampelinus and therefore is subjected to stronger selection for visual and behavioral qualities enhancing escape from predators. Differential predation pressures, thus, may also have been instnllnental in the evolution of these eye and behavioral differences in the two species. Data, presented elsewhere, on reproductive regimes and growth rates of these species accord with this hypothesis.",

The species has been recorded at elevations of 2630 meters (m) in western United States, 2265 m in Mexico, and 2450 m in Central America (Van Gclder, 1959) . r.,\u2022lany authors (for example, Baker, 1956 :307, Dalquest, 1953 Hall, 1946:200; Hall and Villa, 1949:448; Villa, 1953:465) have noted that spotted skunks live in stone walls or rocky areas in highlands, but these observers fail to describe in detail the adjacent topography and vegetative cover. Consequently, the following information seems worth recording.Playa Azul, an elevated mesa at 2415 m and covered with pine-oak forest, consists of approximately 200 hectares surrounded by steep-sided barrancas except for a narrow connection on the north side to the main Sierra Madre Occidental in south-central Durango, 10 kilometers southeast of Llano Grande. Field parties from the Museum at Michigan State University have visited this Mexican locality in the four summers (July) of 1971 to 1974 for the purpose of studying mammalian populations. It was unexpected after so much previous trapping that in the fourth summer (of 1974) the first records of the spotted skunk (S. p. leltcoparia Merriam) for the area would be obtained. Although Tomahawk live-traps (size 13 by 13 by 41 centimeters) were baited with canned fish for as long as ten consecutive nights at intervals along all sides of Playa Azul, the four males captured were taken in a restricted area on the northeast-facing slope. On close inspec_ tion, we found that these spotted skunks were using at least three dens in the broken rubble just below the upper edge of the rimrock bordering the top of the mesa. The",
