Despite such resemblances, ''marmosines'' are now widely recognized as a polyphyletic group, some members of which may be more closely related to Didelphis and other large opossums than to Marmosa sensu stricto (see Kirsch and Palma, 1995; Patton et al., 1996; Jansa and Voss, 2000; Voss and Jansa, 2003) . Although considerable progress has been made toward a monophyletic classification of these animals, the unrevised contents of several genera remain problematic.",

Similar variation had previously been noted by Hershkovitz (1992) , who interpreted it as intraspecific polymorphism. However, the presence or absence of secondary foramina ovales formed by anteromedial bullar processes is a phylogenetically conservative character among didelphids-with a marked tendency to be constant within genera and even higher taxa (Voss and Jansa, 2003 : character 45)-so we looked for correlated characters that might indicate the presence of two or more forms within the material that has traditionally been referred to G. agilis. To our surprise, such characters were not hard to find. Moreover, the same characters appeared to diagnose a group of species comprising a hitherto unrecognized clade.",

Briefly, a region approximately 1.2 kb long of IRBP exon 1 was amplified from genomic DNA using primers A and D1. This product was used as a template in two subsequent PCR reactions, one using primer A paired with F and one using primers E1 and D1. The resulting PCR product was sequenced in both directions using amplification primers and dye terminator chemistry (BigDye Cycle Sequencing, Applied Biosystems Inc.).

(2001: 29) disagreed and suggested that the type of agricolai needed to be reexamined to determine its true relationships. Although we have not seen the holotype, we were able to borrow the paratype (MNRJ 1494), which agrees in all relevant details with Moojen's (1943) description and illustration. Carvalho et al. (2002) described the chromosomes of this species (which they identi- fied as Gracilinanus emiliae) based on 13 specimens from Goi\u00e1s. According to their cytogenetic analysis, the karyotype consists of 14 diploid chromosomes, of which 6 pairs are biarmed autosomes (2n \u03ed 14, FN \u03ed 24); the X chromosome is metacentric or acrocentric (polymorphism in this trait was noted), the Y is acrocentric, and the nucleolar organizing region is on the short arm of chromosome 6. The Lagoa Santa material that Winge (1893) reported as Grymaeomys pusillus is composite. Whereas three ZMUC specimens so identified in Winge's distinctive handwriting (ZMUC 149, 151, 160) are Cryptonanus agricolai, another (ZMUC 225) is an unidentified species of Gracilinanus. 6 Winge's published illustration (1893: pl. II, fig. 4 ), however, clearly shows the principal diag- 6 ZMUC 225, a skin and partial skull from Lund's original collection (number L.16), is either Gracilinanus agilis or G. microtarsus-morphologically similar and occasionally sympatric species whose diagnostic differences were not known to RSV at the time he examined this specimen in Copenhagen. Tate (1933: 191) examined ZMUC 225 and referred it to G. microtarsus, but this identification should be reconfirmed using the criteria suggested by Costa et al. (2003) . nostic traits of Cryptonanus (premolar proportions, absence of maxillary palatal fenestrae, and absence of a secondary foramen ovale). Tate (1933) examined many of the ZMUC specimens listed below and misidentified them as Marmosa agilis agilis.",

Cabrera (1958) thought that two such doubtfully distinct taxa were unlikely to occur together and synonymized them under the former trinomen, apparently without having examined the material in question. In fact, the BMNH specimens from Sapucay were correctly identified by Tate and exhibit all of the diagnostic features of the genera to which we now refer them. Although taken at the same locality, the Sapucay specimens of Gracilinanus agilis and Cryptonanus chacoensis were not collected simultaneously, and it is 7 Massoia and Fornes (1972) did not describe any of the diagnostic traits of Cryptonanus, but their cranial illustration seems to indicate that maxillary vacuities and a secondary foramen ovale are absent, and their cranial measurements (e.g., zygomatic breath and least interorbital breadth) broadly overlap our measurements of C. chacoensis. On the other hand, the illustrated dentition lacks accessory canine cusps (usually present in C. chacoensis), and P2 seems to be subequal in height to P3. Because their report provides unique information about the distribution and natural history of C. chacoensis in northeastern Argentina, the specimens they collected should be reexamined to confirm this identification. possible that they were found in different local habitats. 8 Anderson (1997) reported four specimens of ''Gracilinanus agilis chacoensis'' from three Bolivian localities. Based on a card file in the AMNH Department of Mammalogy archives that provides the museum catalog numbers of the specimens Anderson examined, we determined that his record of chacoensis from Chuquisaca was based on MSB 63275, an unidentified species of Marmosops (see Voss et al., 2004b) . Unfortunately, we have not been able to examine the other material that Anderson reported as chacoensis, most of which was returned to Bolivia.

The separate calendar intervals represented by these dates suggest that Foster might have shifted his collecting activities near Sapucay during the intervening three-month period, but we are not aware of any documentary evidence to support or refute this conjecture. External and Craniodental Measurements (mm) and Weights (g) of Cryptonanus chacoensis guahybae is a distinctively reddish form with gray-based buffy underparts that differs conspicuously in coloration from other congeneric taxa (all of which have duller, usually brownish or grayish-brown dorsal fur and much paler, usually self-whitish ventral fur). Although overlapping broadly with C. agricolai and C. chacoensis in all measured dimensions (tables 5-7), C. guahybae has a geographically discrete distribution (all referred specimens are from Rio Grande do Sul), and other trenchant differences may emerge from side-by-side comparisons of fresh material. In particular, mammary counts may be diagnostic. In the material we examined, one fluid-preserved female specimen of C. guahybae (BMNH 82.9.30.42) has 7-1-7 \u03ed 15 mammae, of which the anteriormost three pairs are ''pectoral'' (arranged in parallel series anterior to the circular array of abdominal/inguinal teats; see Tate, 1933: fig. 3 ), whereas a fluid-preserved female specimen of C. chacoensis (UMMZ 134552) has 4-1-4 \u03ed 9 mammae, all of which are abdominal/inguinal.

In particular, the ventral fur is selforange (''clay colored'' sensu D\u00edaz et al., 2002) from chin to anus with a prominent mid-pectoral blaze of self-white hairs. In addition, the zygomatic arches are unusually wide and robust, and the postorbital process of the jugal is massively developed. Other unusual features include prominent temporal scars that extend posteriorly from the postorbital region along the dorsolateral contour of the relatively small braincase to merge with well-developed lambdoidal crests near the dorsal apex of the occiput. The upper canines are very long, and the palatine fenestrae consist of two small holes on each side of the palate rather than the single large hole seen in most congeneric specimens. Despite this impressive list of distinctive attributes, however, we note that AMNH 167852 is a very old adult male (as indicated by its heavily worn molars and fused basioccipital/basisphenoid suture) and that some of its peculiar features are age-correlated in other didelphid taxa. Large ontogenetic series of most opossums, for example, show a tendency for older animals to have better-developed temporal scars, lambdoidal crests, and more massive zygomatic arches, but relatively smaller braincases than younger conspecifics (e.g., Tate, 1933; Abdala et al., 2001; Flores et al., 2003) . In addition, the canine fangs of old adult male didelphids are often extruded from their alveoli to a much greater extent than in conspecific females and younger males.",

Given the ontogenetic interpretation of some traits exhibited by the holotype of ignitus, the hypothesis that this specimen is just an elderly example of chacoensis merits consideration. Indeed, although the holotype of ignitus is larger than any specimens herein referred to chacoensis in most measurements, ontogenetically invariant dimensions of the molar dentition (LM, M1-M3) are similar in both forms (tables 6, 8). D\u00edaz et al. (2002) did not explicitly compare iginitus with chacoensis because they regarded the latter form as conspecific with Gracilinanus agilis following then-current usage. Our side-by-side comparisons of AMNH 167852 with representative material of chacoensis do not reveal any consistent craniodental differences that cannot plausibly be attributed to age. However, the ventral pelage coloration of ignitus is unmatched by any specimens of chacoensis that we have yet examined, and on that basis we prefer to retain Cryptonanus ignitus as a valid binomen pending the results of ongoing fieldwork to obtain additional specimens (R.M. Barquez, personal commun.).",

Among the 30 specimens that we were able to locate in the FMNH, four were Cryptonanus unduaviensis and 26 were G. agilis. Although some of the phenotypic variation that Hershkovitz remarked in the San Joaqu\u00edn series is doubtless attributable to this heterogeneity, our taxonomic assignments do not agree in all cases with his observations about morphological anomalies in this material. 9 Of the seven specimens identified as ''Gracilinanus agilis unduaviensis'' that reported from Bolivia, two (AMNH 72563, 72565) represent Tate's (1931) type series. Of the remainder, we were only able to examine three (UMMZ 155829, 156006, 156007) , all of which are examples of Marmosops noctivagus as previously explained elsewhere (Voss et al., 2004b) . Instead, most of the Bolivian material that we refer to Cryptonanus unduaviensis was identified by as Gracilinanus agilis buenavistae (e.g., AMNH 209150-209156, 260031, 260032, 262401). 9 Among other sources of confusion in attempting to reconcile our identifications with Hershkovitz's (1992) text, he referred to 39 specimens of Gracilinanus agilis from San Joaqu\u00edn in a discussion of bullar variation (p. 23), but subsequently recorded having examined only 32 specimens from that locality (p. 36). We were able to find only 30 specimens from San Joaqu\u00edn with this identification in the FMNH, of which the following are referrable to G. agilis in our usage of that binomen: 114652, 114654-114657, 114659-114663, 114666, 114668, 114669, 114671-114680, and 114682-114684 . Consistent with our taxonomic assignments, Hershkovitz (p. 23) reported the absence of anteromedial bullar processes in FMNH 114658 (a specimen of Cryptonanus unduaviensis), but he also stated that these processes were absent in 114654 (a specimen of G. agilis). Because all of the G. agilis that we examined from San Joaqu\u00edn have anteromedial bullar processes, the latter specimen may have been 114664 (C. unduaviensis). Hershkovitz's other remarks (p. 35) about individual differences in size, pelage color, premolar proportions, and other characters within the San Joaqu\u00edn series are impossible to associate with particular specimens, but it is clear that he did not distinguish intraspecific from higher-taxonomic variation in this material.

Sherman traps were routinely placed in such situations at El Refugio to prevent captured rodents from chewing holes in the nylon mesh from which the snake traps were constructed (L.H.

Massoia and Fornes (1972) characterized a small marsupial that they called Marmosa agilis chacoensis as an inhabitant of gallery forests, but they also noted captures in osier (Salix sp.) plantations and in thickets of pampas grass (Cortaderia sp.) and bulrushes (Scirpus giganteus). Nests that appeared to have been occupied by this species, manufactured from various materials, were found in tree holes and branches from near ground level to 1.6 m above the ground.

Such mosaics are widespread in most of the biomes where specimens have been collected, and anthropogenic habitats (e.g., agricultural fields and weedy secondary growth around houses) might resemble natural ecotones in certain essential structural features. Where Cryptonanus occurs sympatrically with Gracilinanus in trop-ical and subtropical landscapes (e.g., at localities represented in table 13), it is possible that it is more consistently associated with nonforest vegetation than where it occurs allopatrically at temperate latitudes (the main source of Massoia and Fornes' observations), but such conjectures are perhaps premature in the absence of appropriately designed transect-trapping studies.",

To more fully explore the latter phenomenon, we calculated the average number of nodes that differ between MPTs recovered in the latest combined-data analyses with and without Chacodelphys. On average, the 437 MPTs recovered by the analysis with Chacodelphys differed by 13.4 nodes, whereas the 510 MPTs recovered in the analysis without Chacodelphys differed (on average) by only 9.0 nodes. This result suggests that Chacodelphys is now acting as a ''wildcard'' taxon (sensu Nixon and Wheeler, 1992 ) that can occupy numerous relatively deep positions in parsimony-equivalent trees. Obtain-ing sequence data from this problematic terminal, currently known only from the type skin and skull, is a clear priority for future work.",
