We have no records of its occurrence in the pine-fir forest above the 6000 foot contour. The race colimensis is described (Goldman, 1938) as usually smaller and darker than scotti of the southwestern deserts of the United States and adjacent Mexico. The most obvious difference, when compared with specimens of scotti from Arizona and Trans-Pecos Texas, is in color; colimensis is much blacker dorsally and less yellowish or fulvous on the sides and neck. That colimensis is not smaller, as judged by weight, is evident from weights of an adult female, The unexpected discovery of Jentinkia sumichrasti in the Sierra Madre del Sur of central Guerrero and the subsequent efforts to determine the identity of that population led us to review the present knowledge and status of this species in Mexico. The nominate form was described by Saussure in 1860 on the basis of specimens from Mirador, Veracruz. In 1932, Nelson and Goldman described the subspecies campechensis from the lowlands of Campeche and Yucatan and stated that it is similar to sumichrasti of the mountains of Veracruz, \"but considerably smaller; skull smaller, more delicate in structure.\" Subsequently Goodwin (1956) described oaxacensis from the district of Juchitan, southern Oaxaca.",

Earlier, Burt and Hooper (1941) pointed out the futility of trying to differentiate the many named subspecies in Central America on the basis of cranial characters. Unfortnnately, neither treatise presents measurements to substantiate the conclusions drawn. Although Merriam (1902) asserted that molaris differs from narica in having \"molariform teeth, particularly the upper ones, very much larger and more massive,\" he, too, gave no measurements to substantiate the statement.

Only two specimens were available from all of western Mexico, both from Los Masos, Jalisco. To these he assigned the name glaucula. Two specimens were also available from the eastern drainage of Mexico, one from Cordoba, Veracruz, the other from Cerro San Felipe near Oaxaca City, the type locality of F. w. oaxacensis. Therefore, our four specimens from central Guerrero are of cOnsiderable interest. On the basis of the elongated rather than rounded rosette, the shorter maxillary tooth row (26.6 as opposed to 29.4 in males), and the shorter hind foot our specimens are assignable to glaucula. But in length of tail, condylobasal length, breadth of brain case, and interobital width (see Table 6 ) they are like aaxacensis. Consequently, our specimens are not only geographically but also morphologically intermediate between glaucula and oaxacensis.

External and cranial measurements and other pertinent data are presented in Table 10 .We have few data on the population dynamics of this deer. H our age calculations are reasonably accurate, the fawn (No. 5570) was born in August and conceived the previous January; the yearling (No. 5569) likewise was born in August and conceived in January; the young doe (No. 5406) was born in July and conceived the previous December. This, of course, assumes a gestation of seven months as in other Odocoileus. Near Omiltemi in late June a hunter came by our camp carrying the carcass of a fawn we judged to be two weeks old. These meager data indicate June through August is the fawning period with the rutting period from November through January. These data agree with the observations of Joaauin Villanueva who places the period of fawning as July and August. He also pointed out that bucks do not drop their antlers until April or early May.This deer is fairly common in the Sierra Madre del Sur in Guerrero. Although we have definite altitudinal records only for elevations between 2800 and 7800 feet, deer likely occur throughout the wooded areas of the state. They are persistently, although not heavily, hunted throughout the year by local hunters and many of them are marketed in the smaller, isolated villages. Does and fawns are taken as readily as antlered bucks.",

His color descrip~ tion seems to be that for the winter coat, but we would emphasize the darkness (blackish gray with chestnut suffusion).In summer, the upperparts, particularly the rump, are bright chestnut. Following are color notes on a male taken by Davis July 23. Upperparts: rump and lower back chestnut; shoulders and neck grayish; forehead and crown black; muzzle dark gray suffused with black; eye ring pale gray; outside of ears blackish, the inside clear white; top of tail chestnut. Under~ parts: midline of belly, inguinal and axillary areas, and insides of legs whitish; sides of belly and chest white suffused with chestnut; neck grayish white; throat and chin white, the black spot on each side of the lower jaw (which is present in winter) absent.",
