Its eyesight was poor, as was to be expected, but it seemed to have unusually keen ears, as was demonstrated by its aerial sally when catching the moth; and its sense of smell was extremely acute. The latter faculty was noticeable when Carabidae beetles, of which it seemed quite fond, hid among the grass. They always were detected by smell. At such times, the long, attenuated nose came into play, and in pursuit of these insects the shrew dove with great alacrity headlong into the loose sand and among the grass. The pointed nose seemed to penetrate the grass or sand with ease, like the prow of a swiftly moving boat in water. The shrew always was very neat about its toilet and all fecal matter was deposited in a single corner of the cage..",

The subject of this paper probably died from the reverse of Dixon's experience, for after 10 days in captivity it was seen to be ill and was found dead the next morning. With little question its demise was due either to too much food or to food of a poisonous nature. There never was a food shortage, for the interest in watching the shrew attack any insect given it kept 3 persons gathering and feeding fresh insects to it regularly.",

The subject, however, virtually has been neglected by American investigators. Gilbert (1892) and Chaine (1925) have summarized the earlier literature dealing with the as penis and have described and figured this detail in representative species of most of the following orders: Marsupialia, Chiroptera, Insectivora, Carnivora, Cetacea, Rodentia, and Primates. Thomas (191.5) proposed the name \"baculum\" for the os penis and was the first mammalogist to accord it value as a taxonomic character. Pocock (1923) used it in his classification of the Sciuridae, and demonstrated that it could be utilized to good advantage in determining the classification of this group of rodents, in which skull and skin characters often do not prove of great value. Perhaps, however, he over-estimated its importance in taxonomy. Vinogradov (1925) , reporting on Dipodidae and Zapodidae, and Argyropulo (1929) , on the Murinae, have utilized to good advantage the characters of the baculum in their studies.",

The paruus group is not represented in my material and may constitute another group. Subdivision beyond this point seems not to be warranted by the characters displayed by the baculum alone. In other words, characters portrayed by this element apparently are of generic or specific, but not of subspecific, value. Certain species, to be sure, readily are distinguishable by this element alone, but the character here usually is size and not structure, and is not dependable in all cases. Osgood (1909, p. 12) , the latest reviser of the genus, divided Perognathus into two subgenera, \"Perognathus proper, including the small soft-haired species, and Chaetodipus, containing the large coarse-haired and long-tailed forms.\" Osgood further stated that \"All the species except three fall naturally into one or the other of the two subgenera. One of these (formosus) is a Perognathus with strong inclination toward Chaetodipus; another (baileyi) presents the reverse case; and the third (hispidus) must be classed as a Chaetodipus, though it is aberrant in some ways.\" From a study of the bacula of [ormosus and baileyi it seems that these two species do not belong with those now allocated to the subgenera Perognathus or Chaetodipus, but constitute a separate group.",

                "text": "In the hispidus group the baculum deviates strikingly in structure from that of the other 3 groups. It is a fairly heavy bone only slightly curved, and tapers gradually from the proximal to the distal end as in baileyi. Instead of ending in a point, however, there is a definite keel on the dorsal portion of the distal end, and two processes project ventrolaterally, giving the bone, in end view, a trifid appearance ( fig. 40) Dipodomys.-The kangaroo rats studied may be segregated into three groups, according to shape and relative proportions of their bacula. One comprises the heermanni, agilis, and ordii groups, as arranged by Grinnell (1922) ; another the merriami group; and the third includes the microps, deserii, and spectabilis groups. These groups coincide with the arrangement given by Grinnell, with the exception of the agilis group. The latter, I believe, should be placed next to the heermanni group, instead of being separated from it by the ordii and merriami groups. Grinnell admitted the difficulty in arranging the kangaroo rats when he said \"It is impossible to build a 'natural' key that will allocate all the species correctly under these groups. It is the special aggregation or combination of characters which goes to form the concept of any group in one's mind. The following synopsis of the groups is offered with due appreciation of the vagueness appertaining to the diagnoses.\"",

The slightly enlarged basal end tapers to the slender shaft, which terminates in a downward-curving point (figs. 5G, 5H).
