                "text": "Since the mid-1990s, the United States government has employed an enforcement strategy along the U.S.-Mexico border known as Prevention through Deterrence (PTD) (1:64-5) . This strategy involves placing hyper-security measures (e.g., high fencing, motion sensor cameras, lighting systems, field agents) in unauthorized crossing areas surrounding urban ports of entry in an attempt to funnel migrants toward more hostile terrain such as the Sonora Desert of Arizona, where security is less intense, but crossing conditions are more difficult (2) . Those who enter through the desert often walk for long distances (e.g., upwards of 70 miles) while simultaneously negotiating a rugged landscape characterized by extreme conditions where summer temperatures often exceed 100\u00b0F and winter temperatures can reach freezing. These environmental obstacles are intended to act as a \"deterrent\" to migration. Two decades of research has shown that PTD has failed to deter migrants (e.g., ref. 3 ), but has succeeded in shaping border crossing into a well-organized, dangerous, and violent social process (4) . Since 1998, over 5500 people have died while trying to cross into the United States (5: Table 1 ) and the border-based humanitarian group Derechos Humanos estimates that at least 2649 people have perished in the Sonoran Desert region since 2000 (6) . These fatality counts are likely low estimates given that people die in remote areas and their remains often go undiscovered (1: Appendix V).",

Corpses that are recovered are usually reported to law enforcement by migrants themselves or stumbled upon by hikers, humanitarian workers, or researchers. Often times these human remains are found in a fragmented state after environmental conditions and animals have begun to destroy the body, as in the case of these skeletal elements discovered by the senior author in 2011 ( Fig. 1 ). Animal scavenging behavior thus often complicates the identification of bodies or renders their recovery impossible.

These articles draw exclusively on data from a retrospective investigation of coroner reports. While scavengers are mentioned in these studies, their presence is only inferred from skeletal analyses, and there are no data from direct observations of animals interacting with bodies. It is important to also note that neither study mentions vultures, a long recognized member of the Sonoran scavenging guild (10) . Given the highly politicized nature of migrant deaths and the disagreement among the federal government, humanitarian groups, and social science researchers regarding how to properly calculate migrant fatalities (11:32-3) , examining the impacts of scavenging animals on the bodies of border crossers and discussing the implications of these impacts for estimating death rates and identifying remains are crucial to improving our understanding of this clandestine social phenomenon. The aim of this research was to document the decomposition process in Southern Arizona, including the extent and timing of scavenging activity, the identification of various avian and mammalian fauna involved in the process, and the ways in which animals may impact the ability of law enforcement to locate and identify skeletal remains.",

The research presented here was carried out twelve miles north of the Mexican border near the small town of Arivaca, Arizona between June and July of 2012. Three female juvenile pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus), each weighing c. 60 pounds (27 kg), were purchased from the University of Arizona Meat Science Laboratory and transported to Arivaca. Following approved federal, state, and university protocols, these animals were killed on-site by a licensed animal handler who fired a 22 caliber bullet into their brains. These protocols are outlined in the University of Michigan University Committee on Use and Care of Animals project number PRO00003934. After death, all three pigs were dressed in clothes similar to those worn by migrants (i.e., jeans, dark colored shirts, and socks) and personal effects were placed in their pockets in the form of wallets with identification inside and slips of paper with phone numbers written on them. A necklace was placed around one pig's neck (Sun). Many migrant bodies recovered from the desert are fragmentary, and personal effects such as identification cards, personal adornments, and slips of paper with the phone numbers of family members are often used to identify bodies. Our use of pigs in the following experiment draws on the large corpus of previous experimental research that employs these animals as a standard proxy for human bodies in decomposition studies (e.g., 12,13).

This three acre plot was minimally enclosed by a three-strand barbed wire fence that allowed mammalian and avian scavengers relatively free access to the carcasses, similar to what would be experienced in the open desert. One animal (Sun Pig) was placed in direct sunlight in a completely exposed area at the top of small hill ( Fig. 2A ). Another animal (Shade Pig) was placed out of a direct line of sight from Sun Pig underneath a mesquite tree c. 500 m downhill (Fig. 2B ). To create additional shade, a blue tarp was strung above Shade Pig. The rationale underlying these two taphonomic scenarios was that it is typical for migrants to die while either (i) walking on exposed trails or (ii) resting underneath the meager shade provided by the Sonoran vegetation. A third pig was used as a control and placed in a cage under the shade of a mesquite tree. The Sun and Shade Pigs were monitored using motion sensor cameras placed at different angles (Moultrie Model MFH-DGS-M100 and Bushnell Model 119466). The cameras were set to shoot thirty seconds of video along with three still photographs at intervals of thirty seconds whenever motion was detected. Both camera types recorded date and time on the still photographs, which were crucial for documenting the timing of scavenging activity. In addition, these cameras were equipped with infrared sensors and were able to capture images of nocturnal activity.",

On two occasions (after intense scavenging had occurred), a systematic survey was conducted to identify all remaining skeletal elements and personal effects within 100 m of the initial deposition site of Sun Pig. Pin flags were used to mark the location of items and a digital total station (Topcon Model 3200-NW) was used to plot the location of remaining skeletal elements and personal effects. This occurred during the fourth and fifth weeks after death. Similarly, Shade Pig's remains were surveyed and mapped with the total station during the fifth week after death. At the end of 5 weeks, bones from the Sun and Shade Pigs were collected, defleshed, and transported to the University of Michigan. In the fall of 2012, an analysis of the remaining bones was conducted to identify which skeletal elements were preserved and to determine whether there were any differences in preservation. In addition, accumulated degree-days (ADD) were calculated up until the moment of skeletonization for Sun and Shade pig using methods reported by Megyesi et al. (14) . ADD are reported below and listed in Table 1 . A spatial analysis of the dispersal patterns of Sun and Shade Pig's remains were conducted using ARC GIS version 10.1. The points were imported into ArcMap 10.1 from an Excel file containing spatial (X,Y,Z coordinates based on a site datum point tied to a GPS location) and anatomical data (bone type). The map was analyzed using basic spatial statistics tools from the Spatial Statistics Toolbox in ArcGIS 10.1. The Standard Distance Tool was used to visualize the concentration and dispersal of skeletal elements at 1 standard deviation and the directional distribution (or Standard Deviational Ellipse) helps show the relative direction of the dispersal. Additionally, the distance of each element moved over the course of the experiment was measured in ArcMap 10.1 using the Near Tool (in Analysis Tools) with an input feature consisting of points taken around the perimeter of the original carcass location in the case of Shade Pig and from a single center point in the case of Sun Pig. Each element was measured to the nearest point of the input feature.",

However, all scavengers had minimal contact with Sun Pig for several weeks and during this period the carcass passed through the early and advanced decomposition stages described by Galloway (9: Table 1) heavily on smell, to locate it. The first scavenging animal to make close contact with Sun Pig was a coyote (Canis latrans) 5 days after death (58.33 ADD). For three consecutive nights, a solitary coyote circled the carcass and sniffed it. Seven days after death (72.78 ADD), a domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris) from one of the nearby residences was caught on camera chewing part of the intestines that had ruptured through the stomach lining. Given that many migrants often die near rural residences while seeking help, the impact of this nontraditional scavenging animal on the carcass should not be considered an anomaly or an error in our research design. Instead, we argue that dogs are an underappreciated member of the Sonoran Desert scavenging guild and their taphonomic impact on the remains of border crossers may be quite significant. Nine days after death (91.94 ADD), coyotes were recorded eating portions of Sun Pig's lower back. However, canine and coyote scavenging was still relatively minimal and neither group moved the carcass from its initial placement nor disarticulated any part of the animal. Essentially, these mammalian scavengers simply removed the small bits of flesh that were easily accessible.",

Dogs and coyotes both use scent-marking as a form of territorial defense (15, 16) .

In both specimens, the cervical vertebrae were the most poorly preserved, the lumbar vertebrae demonstrated the second highest degree of preservation, and the thoracic vertebrae were well preserved (Fig. 9) . This preservational patterning is taphonomically intriguing, as poor representation of cervical vertebrae may be an artifact of carnivorous activity localized around the cranium, specifically scavenger attempts to access fatty brain tissue. Further support for this hypothesis is the recovery of the lateral part of the occipital bone for both the sun and the Shade Pig, suggesting a particular focus on the region around the foramen magnum. Similarly, the medium level of lumbar preservation likely reflects the vultures' preferred method of ingress into a decomposing carcass-generally through pulling organs and soft-tissue out of the aperture created by the anus (see 18:S23). Localized and rigorous defleshing around the caudal region would likely lead some of the lumbar vertebrae to disarticulate more readily. The relatively poor preservation of thoracic vertebrae in the Shade Pig is surprising, particularly given the high degree of completion of the rib cage for this carcass. However, this may be related to relatively poor TABLE 2--Preservation of Cranial Bones: Shade Pig. Cranial preservation was slightly asymmetrical, with more bones present on the left side. The left palatine bone received a 0.5 completion score as part of the bone was broken off during the decomposition process. A \"N\" indicates bones for which only a midline portion was preserved.

First, we mapped Shade Pig on two separate occasions, and the visibility of skeletal elements changed daily because of both the environmental conditions (e.g., rain fall) and the movement of bones by scavengers.

The analysis of element type by distance from carcass also suggests a similar pattern of net dispersal. For each pig, the majority of anatomical elements were moved 1-5 m away from the original site of deposition Table 5 . The main difference between the two depositional contexts was in the number of elements moved short or long distances. In the shade deposition site, more elements remained close to the area where the body was originally placed, while in the open (sunny) deposition site, more than one quarter of the recovered elements were mapped at distances more than 5 m from the body (Figs 10-12 ). However, this difference in dispersal signatures is likely linked to different local micro-environments; The Shade Pig was placed underneath a tree that may have acted as a partial barrier to element dispersal while providing a more protected environment for scavenging. Additionally, Shade Pig was placed in a topographic low point, whereas Sun Pig was placed atop a small hill. The greatest elevation change between elements of Shade Pig's scatter was about 2 m and c. 3 m in the case of Sun Pig.",

In both contexts, there was a clear directionality to element dispersal-in the shaded context, elements fan out from the tree, while in the sunny context, elements move down the nearest slope and out into the open. Overall, this patterning is consistent with observations of vulture scavenging behavior and much of the dispersal is likely attributable to this taxon. During the course of the study vultures were observed scavenging in groups of 2-8 individuals and often moved elements at a small scales (<1 m) while feeding or negotiating the difficulties posed by clothing. Movement of elements 1-5 m away may represent attempts by individuals to isolate their portion of the carcass to feed at a distance from conspecifics, a behavior that has been previously observed in turkey vultures (19) . Relocation of elements more than 5 m away from the original site of deposition suggests deliberate movement away from a central feeding locale and may involve continued vulture activity or that of scavengers not observed by the surveillance cameras.",

Similarly, 96% and 84% of the mapped spinal elements were found within 5 m of the deposition site for the Shade Pig and Sun Pig, respectively. Cranial elements were more evenly dispersed, with at least 33% recovered more than 5 m away from the body. Because subadult pigs were used when conducting this experiment, most cranial bones were disarticulated along sutures. For scavengers dealing with humans, it is likely that cranial disarticulation would be more difficult, particularly in an adult human cranium with closed sutures; in such a situation, we could expect cranial elements to be less dispersed. Finally, long bones and limb elements were those most likely to be moved a significant distance from the deposition site. For the Shade Pig, over half of the recovered limb elements were found more than 5 m away from the body, while for the Sun Pig, 66% of the mapped limb elements were found more than 5 m away from the initial site of deposition. Limbs provide relatively large, easily transportable \"packets\" of muscle tissue and fat, particularly when compared to the ribs or vertebrae. Accordingly, this spatial patterning is likely reflective of individual scavengers \"foraging optimally\", removing high-calorie, easily disarticulated elements from the carcass to deflesh and consume them away from conspecifics.",

The note card placed in Shade Pig's pocket was not recovered during our survey. Such findings suggest that associated artifacts may be moved a fairly long distance away from the areas where individuals have died and that some objects, which could be the most useful for identification (i.e., a phone number written on a piece of paper) may disappear completely.

Data were collected on skeletal preservation of remains, scavenger activity and spatial distribution of elements and associated artifacts. Motion sensor cameras recorded a wide range of local fauna (Table 8) interacting with the Sus scrofa carcasses, including scavengers such as turkey vultures, black vultures, ravens, coyotes, domestic dogs, and \"peripheral\" fauna such as cattle, domestic cats, and doves. The recurring presence of domestic dogs is intriguing, especially as this taxon may be discouraging coyote scavenging in areas in close proximity to human habitation. Given that migrant corpses are often found near rural residences, domestic dogs may be contributing to the disarticulation and consumption of human bodies in southern Arizona. Our results also confirm that vultures are an underappreciated member of the Sonoran scavenging guild-members of this taxon are the primary agents responsible for defleshing and dispersing skeletal elements in this desert. We found that the tempo of scavenging was similar for both the sunny and shaded sites: An initial period of relatively limited scavenger activity was followed by preliminary investigations by vultures or canids, culminating in a rapid period (1-3 days) of vulture feeding that led to decimation of the soft tissue and skeletonization and dispersal of the remains. Importantly, our research contributes to a growing literature (12, 18, 20) that has begun to illustrate the differential impact of vultures on decomposition relative to their position in local ecosystems.",

Limb bones are also likely to be recovered, although these will be dispersed at a greater distance from the body (>5 m). Cranial elements, particularly those of younger individuals, will also likely be widely dispersed (>5 m). Although crania for both pigs were highly disarticulated, elements of the dentition were recovered for the Sun Pig after 5 weeks, despite the dispersal of the crania. However, given that the recovery time for human bodies can be as long as several years post-mortem, it is unclear how much of the skull would remain after more prolonged exposure to the elements and animal scavenging. Exposure to multiple seasons of rain may also further displace bones from the initial death site. In particular, our findings suggest that the cranium and dentition, the skeletal regions most useful for forensic identification, are unlikely to be well preserved in a desert environment if a body is recovered more than 2 months after death; In such cases, recourse to DNA analysis may be required to identify the remains.",

This finding is troubling for at least two reasons. First, law enforcement that are called to recover bodies often have limited time and insufficient training to conduct a full systematic survey of an area where remains are found. These surveys are usually fairly informal, do not last more than a few minutes, and focus only on the immediate area where bones or corpses are located (De Le on field observations; R. Kee personal communication). Our results suggest that in cases where a body has been skeletonized and disarticulated, the survey area for locating additional bones and personal effects should minimally be 100 square meters and possibly more depending on the original point of death. Second, when skeletal elements that can be used to identify a body (e.g., skull and teeth) are missing, all items (e.g., shoes and clothes) located <100 square meters from the remaining bones could be potential clues to a person's identity and should thus be collected and associated with remaining bone fragments. Often times, these personal effects are vital to the identification of fragmented bodies (21) .",

(22:489) comment that \"scavengers may not only alter bodies but also may change scenes or obliterate evidence.\" Our data unfortunately confirm this statement and suggest that vultures in particular may have serious impacts on bodies left exposed to the Sonoran Desert environment (Fig. 14) and complicate (or render impossible) the identification of corpses. Given that migrants usually travel with minimal (or no) identification (see 23) , scavenger activity that destroys body parts and widely disperses personal effects and bones is likely contributing to the growing number of unidentified bodies that are recovered in Southern Arizona each year. Moreover, migrants may die in remote areas where their corpses lay on exposed terrain for long periods of time. Scavenging animals and the desert environment are likely destroying many bodies before they can be recovered. This means that current estimates of migrant fatalities in this region are undercounting the actual number of people who have died while trying to cross the border since the start of PTD. We have only presented two depositional scenarios (direct sun light and shade) and studies of other death contexts (e.g., washes or ravines where bodies are subject to seasonal water flow or situations where migrants cover companions who die en route with brush and rocks) are much needed. In addition, we only report data for a 5-week period following death and more longitudinal studies need to be undertaken to better understand how bodies preserve at different times of the year, over long periods of time, and through multiple seasons. Still, we hope that the preliminary data presented here will serve as an impetus for more large-scale taphonomic experiments that can improve our understanding of the varying rates of body decomposition and skeletal disarticulation in this highly politicized desert environment.",
