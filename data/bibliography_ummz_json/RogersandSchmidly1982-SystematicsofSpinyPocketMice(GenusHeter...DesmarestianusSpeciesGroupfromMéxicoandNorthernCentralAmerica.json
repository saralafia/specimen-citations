                "text": "The genus Heteromys (Heteromyidae, subfamily Heteromyinae), as currently defined, comprises 11 species that are exclusively Neotropical in distribution. Goldman (1911) , in his revision of the subfamily Heteromyinae (Heteromys and Liomys), divided the genus Heteromys into two subgenera, with eight species included in the subgenus Heteromys and two (H. nelsoni and H. oresterus) allocated to the subgenus Xylomys. Hall (1981) further divided the Middle American species of the subgenus Heteromys into two species groups, the desmarestianus-group (including H. desmarestianus, H. longicaudatus, H. gaumeri, H. goldmani, H. lepturus, and H. temporalis) and the anomalus-group (including H. anomalus, H. australis, and H. nigricaudatus) . Most species have restricted ranges and only one, H. desmarestianus, which occurs from eastern Oaxaca, Mexico, southward to Panama, has an extensive distribution. H. longicaudatus and H. temporalis are known from one and three localities in Tabasco and Veracruz, respectively; H. goldmani occurs in southwestern Chiapas and western Guatemala. H. lepturus is known from scattel'ed localities in Oaxaca and Veracruz, and H. gaumeri occurs in Yucatan, Campeche, and Quintana Roo. H. anomalus is restricted to Colombia and Venezuela, and H. australis, another South American species, enters Middle America in extreme eastern Panama. H. nigricaudatus is known from two localities in east-central Oaxaca (Goodwin, 1956) , but Goodwin (1969) synonymized this taxon with H. lepturus.",

Females showed the same general pattern with all variables significantly separating age groups I-III from IV and V except for maxillary toothrow length, interparietal width, and interparietal length. Only one character (nasal length in males) differed significantly between groups IV and V. As a result of these analyses, groups I, II, and III were excluded from further statistical treatment.

The third group includes samples previously referred to H. lepturus and these are virtually indistinguishable from specimens of H. desmarestianus from Nicaragua (described by Genoways, 1973) . The bacula of this latter group are of comparable size to those in group two, but have a thinner midshaft diameter and a more pointed distal tip.",

Goodwin (1969) observed that desmarestlanus exhibited overall darker coloration with the upper sides of the ankles white, as opposed to the overall buffy gray color and dusky ankles of leptuTUS. Our analysis reveals that the range of individual variation in both lepturus and desmarestianus is so great that it is impossible to distinguish the two on the basis of external features. Furthermore, using univariate and multivariate analyses of external and cranial features and bacular morphology, we could not distinguish samples occurring on either side of the Isthmus; hence, we regard the two as conspecific and arrange them under the name H. d. desmarestlanus, which has priority.",

Typically, these specimens exhibit a broader zygomatic breadth, shorter maxillary toothrow, and smaller external measurements, but they differ significantly from other samples only in greater zygomatic breadth (see Fig. 3 ). Principal components analysis also revealed the distinctness of sample 5 from other samples in Veracruz. Although the physical isolation of the Sierra de Tuxtla by lowlands has apparently been of sufficient duration to permit subspecific differentiation in a few Upper Tropical Zone birds (Andrle, 1967) , in our opinion, divergence of spiny pocket mice (at least with the characters examined) has not been sufficient to warrant their recognition.",

                "text": "Diagnosis.-A subspecies of desmarestianus characterized by a relatively long tail, short toothrow, flat skull, short rostrum, and wide interorbital and mastoid regions. Color dark, but not so dark as in H. goldmani, and without buffy lateral line.Distribution.-Heavily forested eastern basal slopes of mountains in central Veracruz, Mexico.Comparisons.-In general color and external measurements, H. d. temporalis resembles H. goldmani but the cranial and bacular characters are distinctive. The former, compared to the latter, has a shorter maxillary toothrow, shorter skull, narrower rostrum, broader and flatter braincase, much broader sagittal area, and a more triangular interparietal. The baculum of temporalis, compared to goldmani, is larger in all measurements, thicker in the midshaft area, and not laterally flattened at the distal tip (see Fig. 6 ). For comparison with H. d. desmarestianus, see account of that subspecies.Remarks. -Goldman (1911) noted that temporalis differed from desmarestianus and goldmani in that the temporal ridges followed the parietosquamosal suture instead of crossing the parietal. The formel condition is definitely evident in the holotype of temporalis and in one of the two paratypes (USNM 63720; the posterior portion of the skull and the temporal ridges are absent in the other paratype, USNM 63718). However, of 14 specimens subsequently collected in the vicinity of Motzorongo and Ojo de Agua, Veracruz, none had temporal ridges that followed the parietosquamosal suture. Hence, we are of the opinion that this characteristic is not diagnostic of H. d. temporalis.Specimens examined (I7).-MEXICO.

Washington, 15:41, March.Holotype.-Adult male, skin and skull, USNM (Biological Survey Collection) 77576; Chicharras, Chiapas, Mexico. Type examined.Distribution.-Heavily forested Pacific slope of the Sierra Madre in extreme southern Chiapas and adjacent portions of southwestern Guatemala.Diagnosis.-A large, dark-colored species of Heteromys, having a tail considerably longer than the head and body. Skull large and angular, with rather flat rostrum, anteriorly spreading zygoma, narrow and posteriorly tapering premaxillae, and irregularly oval interparietal.Comparisons. -Compared to H. d. desmarestianus, H. goldmani is darker and the upper parts lack a pronounced sprinkling of slender, ochraceous hairs. Cranially, it is significantly larger in zygomatic breadth, greatest length of skull, length of rostrum, nasal length, and mastoid breadth than specimens of desmarestianus from Chiapas and Guatemala. The zygoma of goldmani are also more spread anteriorly and the interparietal is broader transversely and relatively shorter anteroposteriorly than in desmarestianus. The baculum of goldmani, compared to desmarestianus, is smaller in all measurements, more nearly round basally and constricted posteriorly, more laterally flattened distal tip, and has a smaller index of robustness. For comparison with H. d. temporalis, see account of that subspecies.Remarks.-Considerable geographic variation is evident among the three samples of this species studied. In the univariate analysis, mice in sample 17 are significantly larger than those in samples 16 and 18 in least interorbital constriction, whereas sample 17 is Significantly smaller than the other two samples in maxillary toothrow length. Mice in sample 18 are significantly smaller than those in samples 16 and 17 in rostrum length. In the multivariate analysis, samples 16 and 18 clustered together at a low level and apart from sample 17 (see Fig. 4 ).Specimens examined (37).-MEXICO.
