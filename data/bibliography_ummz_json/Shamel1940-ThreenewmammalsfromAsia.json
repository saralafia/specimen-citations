All the adult skins from Suifu are alike in color except a female collected in June, which has a shorter, more finely grizzled coat. The chin in some of these specimens is white rather than buffy as in the type. One other specimen from Tseo Gia Keo, is evidently in summer pelage, though the date of collection is not known. Its fur is quite short, shorter than the June specimen from Suifu, the colors are much paler than the other specimens, and the grizzling is very fine.",

The darker richer color of this subspecies will readily distinguish it from any of its neighboring relatives. It is most like Lepus europaeus aurigineus Hollister from Kiangsi.
