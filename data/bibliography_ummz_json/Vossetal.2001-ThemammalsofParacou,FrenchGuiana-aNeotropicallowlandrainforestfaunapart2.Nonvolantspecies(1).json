Working within a 3-km radius over the course of 202 sampling dates from 1991 to 1994, we recorded a total of 64 nonvolant species by conventional trapping, arboreal platform trapping, pitfall trapping, diurnal and nocturnal hunting, and interviews with local residents. Included in this total species count are 12 marsupials, 9 xenarthrans, 6 primates, 10 carnivores, 5 ungulates, and 22 rodents.",

                "text": "Systematic research with nonvolant mammal specimens collected as voucher material resulted in the discovery of new taxa, documented range extensions of previously described species, and helped resolve many longstanding taxonomic problems: (1) Gracilinanus emiliae (Thomas) , herein reported for the first time from French Guiana, is redescribed and its known geographic distribution documented; based on examination of type material and original descriptions, G. longicaudus Hershkovitz is considered a junior synonym of G. emiliae, but Marmosa agricolai Moojen is not. (2) A new genus is proposed for Gracilinanus kalinowskii Hershkovitz, a taxon previously known only from eastern Peru, in recognition of its trenchant morphological differences from all other known didelphimorph marsupials. (3) Marmosops parvidens (Tate) and M. pinheiroi (Pine) , the latter originally described as a subspecies of the former, are distinct species that occur sympatrically at Paracou; based on examination of type material, other taxa hitherto synonymized with M. parvidens are also judged to be valid species, including M. juninensis (Tate) and M. bishopi (Pine) . 4Monodelphis brevicaudata (Erxleben) , M. glirina (Wagner) , and M. palliolata (Osgood) are all distinct species diagnosable by unique combinations of morphological traits; based on examined specimens, M. brevicaudata (with type locality emended herein as Kartabo, Guyana) appears to be endemic to the Guiana subregion of Amazonia and to include both bicolored and tricolored phenotypes; a neotype from Cayenne, French Guiana, is designated to fix the application of Viverra touan Shaw as the oldest available name for the tricolored form. (5) Saguinus midas (Linnaeus) and S. niger (E. Geoffroy), currently treated as synonyms or conspecific races, are unambiguously diagnosable species that do not appear to be sister taxa; a neotype is designated to conserve current usage of niger E. Geoffroy for the black-handed tamarin of southeastern Amazonia. (6) Two new small species of Neacomys are described from material collected at Paracou; their diagnostic attributes are documented by detailed comparisons with other like-sized congeners from northern South America. (7) Nectomys melanius Thomas is recognized as a species distinct from N. squamipes (Brants) and N. palmipes J. A. Allen and Chapman; however, N. parvipes Petter is not a valid taxon and is herein synonymized with N. melanius. (8) The diagnostic characters of Neusticomys oyapocki (Petter and Dubost) , a species previously known only from the holotype, are reevaluated and illustrated from freshly collected material. (9) Oecomys auyantepui Tate and O. paricola (Thomas) , previously treated as synonyms, are valid species distinguished by consistent cranial differences and occupy allopatric ranges north and south of the Amazon, respectively. (10) A critical examination of small Oecomys specimens from Paracou and other Guianan localities supports the conclusions of other investigators that O. rutilus Anthony and O. bicolor (Tomes) are unambiguously diagnosable species. (11) Oligoryzomys fulvescens (Saussure) and O. microtis (J. A. Allen), currently regarded as valid allopatric species occurring north and south of the Amazon, respectively, are difficult to diagnose unambiguously and may be conspecific; new information is provided about the hitherto ambiguous type locality of the latter taxon. (12) Rhipidomys nitela Thomas is reported from French Guiana for the first time and its previously unpublished diagnostic differences from other congeners are tabulated and discussed. (13) A lectotype is designated for Coendou melanurus (Wagner) , and the species is redescribed based on all known specimens in North American and European museums; diagnostic differences between this species and C. insidiosus (Olfers) are illustrated for the first time. (14) A red-rumped agouti (Dasyprocta) is designated as the neotype of Mus aguti Linnaeus to preserve current usage of Dasyprocta prymnolopha (Wagler) for the black-rumped agouti. (15) The diagnostic differences between red and green acouchies (Myoprocta) are discussed and a neotype is designated for Cavia acouchy Erxleben to fix the application of that name to the red species; other nominal taxa of Myoprocta are identified as red or green acouchies based on examination of type material and original descriptions. (16) The diagnostic morphological traits of Proechimys cuvieri Petter and P. guyannensis (E. Geoffroy) are reevaluated and discussed based on character variation in topotypical (French Guianan) material.",

Instead, nonparametric statistical extrapolations suggest that the Paracou nonvolant mammal fauna consists of somewhere between 69 and 74 species; by implication, our nonvolant inventory is about 86-93% complete.

Pairwise similarity values likewise show an obvious positive correlation between faunal resemblance and geographic proximity within the Neotropical rainforest biome. At least 24 species (38%) of the Paracou nonvolant fauna are Amazonian endemics, but 18 (28%) are essentially pan-Neotropical in distribution; the remaining 22 species exhibit a variety of distributional patterns that suggest past connections among different sets of currently disjunct rainforested regions.",

Preliminary guild comparisons among three exemplar faunas, however, suggest that the Paracou nonvolant community is substantially less diverse in arboreal frugivores and more diverse in terrestrial animalivores than are nonvolant communities at some Central American and western Amazonian sites. Subsistence and recreational hunting has clearly affected local populations of some nonvolant mammals at Paracou; whereas popular game species (e.g., large primates) were seldom sighted, density compensation may explain high local densities of certain other taxa (e.g., Potus flavus and Cuniculus paca).

Not surprisingly, most of the taxa that usefully define a Guianan center of mammalian endemism are nonvolant species. The geographic limits of Guianan endemism appear to be remarkably similar for mammals, birds, snakes, lizards, and trees, suggesting a common pattern of biotic differentiation. VOSS ET AL.: RAINFOREST MAMMAL FAUNA Overall, the Paracou mammal fauna conforms broadly with previous generalizations about community-wide patterns of diel activity and substrate use by Neotropical rainforest mammals, but appears to diverge significantly from conventional views about trophic structure. Whereas there are many more species of secondary consumers than primary consumers at Paracou, primary consumers appear to outnumber secondary consumers by an equally large margin at some western Amazonian inventory sites. Sampling artifacts perhaps explain some of the community differences observed in such comparisons, but real geographic variation in trophic structure is also apparent.",

Par comparaison avec la s\u00e9rie type et les descriptions originelles, G. longicaudus Hershkovitz est consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un synonyme post\u00e9rieur \u00e0 G. emiliae, mais Marmosa agricolai est une esp\u00e8ce diff\u00e9rente. (2) Un nouveau genre est propos\u00e9 pour le taxon Gracilinanus kalinowskii Hershkovitz, qui n'\u00e9tait auparavant connu que de l'Est du P\u00e9rou, mais qui diff\u00e8re de tous les autres marsupiaux didelphimorphes par de singuliers caract\u00e8res morphologiques. (3) Marmosops parvidens (Tate) et M. pinheiroi (Pine) , ce dernier originellement d\u00e9crit comme une sous-esp\u00e8ce du premier, sont deux taxons distincts, qui vivent en sympatrie \u00e0 Paracou. Apr\u00e8s examen des sp\u00e9cimens de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence (holotype et paratypes), d'autres taxons pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment mis en synonymie avec M. parvidens apparaissent n\u00e9ammoins \u00eatre des esp\u00e8ces distinctes, comme M. juninensis (Tate) et M. bishopi (Pine) . (4) Monodelphis brevicaudata (Erxleben) , M. glirina (Wagner) , et M. palliolata (Osgood) sont trois esp\u00e8ces distinctes, reconnaissables par des combinaisons discriminantes de caract\u00e8res morphologiques. A partir des sp\u00e9cimens \u00e0 disposition, l'esp\u00e8ce M. brevicaudata (dont la localit\u00e9-type est red\u00e9finie comme Kartabo, au Guyana) appara\u00eet end\u00e9mique du bouclier guyanais au sein de la r\u00e9gion amazonienne, et comporte des formes bi-et tri-color\u00e9es. Un n\u00e9otype de Cayenne (Guyane fran\u00e7aise) est d\u00e9sign\u00e9 pour repr\u00e9senter le taxon Viverra touan Shaw, qui est le plus ancien nom disponible pour la forme tricolore. (5) Saguinus midas (Linnaeus) et S. niger (E. Geoffroy), traditionnellement consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme synonymes ou comme races consp\u00e9cifiques, sont reconnaissables de fa\u00e7on indiscutable, et ne semblent pas \u00eatre des esp\u00e8ces-soeurs; en cons\u00e9quence de notre analyse, chacun doit \u00eatre reconnu comme une esp\u00e8ce distincte; un n\u00e9otype est d\u00e9sign\u00e9 afin de conserver l'usage r\u00e9pandu du taxon niger E. Geoffroy repr\u00e9sentant les tamarins aux mains noires du sud-est de l'Amazonie. (6) Deux nouvelles petites esp\u00e8ces du genre Neacomys sont d\u00e9crites \u00e0 partir du mat\u00e9riel collect\u00e9 \u00e0 Paracou et dans d'autres localit\u00e9s de la r\u00e9gion des Guyanes; leurs caract\u00e8res diagnostiques sont document\u00e9s par des comparaisons d\u00e9taill\u00e9es avec d'autres cong\u00e9n\u00e8res de taille similaire vivant en r\u00e9gions septentrionales d'Am\u00e9rique du Sud. (7) Nectomys melanius Thomas est reconnu comme une esp\u00e8ce distincte des taxons N. squamipes (Brants) et N. palmipes J. A. Allen et Chapman. Cependant, N. parvipes Petter n'est pas un taxon valide, et est mis ici en synonymie avec N. melanius. (8) Les caract\u00e8res diagnostiques de Neusticomys oyapocki (Petter et Dubost) , une esp\u00e8ce jusqu'ici connue par le seul holotype, sont discut\u00e9s et illustr\u00e9s \u00e0 partir de nouveaux sp\u00e9cimens r\u00e9cemment collect\u00e9s. (9) Oecomys auyantepui Tate et O. paricola (Thomas) , auparavant mis en synonymie, sont diff\u00e9rentes esp\u00e8ces reconnaissables par des caract\u00e8res craniens discriminants; ces taxons ont des r\u00e9partitions allopatriques, respectivement au Nord et au Sud de l'Amazone. (10) Un examen d\u00e9taill\u00e9 des petits sp\u00e9cimens d'Oecomys provenant de Paracou et d'autres localit\u00e9s de la r\u00e9gion des Guyanes confirme l'interpr\u00e9tation d'autres auteurs comme quoi O. rutilus Anthony et O. bicolor (Tomes) sont des esp\u00e8ces distinctes, discr\u00e8tement mais clairement reconnaissables. (11) La diagnose et la distinction d'Oligoryzomys fulvescens (Saussure) et O. microtis (J. A. Allen), actuellement consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme esp\u00e8ces allopatriques distribu\u00e9es respectivement au Nord et au Sud de l'Amazone, sont difficiles \u00e0 \u00e9tablir, et ces deux taxons pourraient \u00eatre consp\u00e9cifiques; de nouvelles donn\u00e9es sont apport\u00e9es au sujet de la localit\u00e9-type d'O. microtis, dont l'emplacement \u00e9tait jusqu'alors ambigu. (12) Rhipidomys nitela Thomas est signal\u00e9 pour la premi\u00e8re fois de Guyane fran\u00e7aise, et les diff\u00e9rences morphologiques diagnostiques de cette esp\u00e8ce sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es et discut\u00e9es par rapport aux autres esp\u00e8ces du genre. (13) Un lectotype est d\u00e9sign\u00e9 pour l'esp\u00e8ce Coendou melanurus (Wagner) , et la description de ce taxon est d\u00e9taill\u00e9e \u00e0 partir des sp\u00e9cimens connus dans les mus\u00e9es nord-am\u00e9ricains et europ\u00e9ens. Des comparaisons et diagnoses par rapport \u00e0 C. insidiosus (Olfers) sont effectu\u00e9es pour la premi\u00e8re fois. (14) Un sp\u00e9cimen d'agouti \u00e0 croupion rouge (genre Dasyprocta) est d\u00e9sign\u00e9 comme n\u00e9otype du taxon Mus aguti Linnaeus, afin de pr\u00e9server l'usage du nom Dasyprocta prymnolopha (Wagler) pour les agoutis \u00e0 croupion noir. (15) Les diff\u00e9rences caract\u00e9ristiques des acouchis rouge et olive du genre Myoprocta sont discut\u00e9es; un sp\u00e9cimen collect\u00e9 \u00e0 Paracou est d\u00e9sign\u00e9 comme le n\u00e9otype de Cavia acouchy Erxleben, afin de pouvoir appliquer ce nom \u00e0 l'acouchi rouge. D'autres taxons du genre Myoprocta sont identifi\u00e9s comme appartenant aux groupes des acouchis rouges ou olives, \u00e0 partir du mat\u00e9riel des localit\u00e9s-type et des descriptions originelles. (16) Les caract\u00e8res morphologiques permettant de discriminer les esp\u00e8ces Proechimys cuvieri Petter et P. guyannensis (E. Geoffroy) sont r\u00e9-\u00e9valu\u00e9s et discut\u00e9s \u00e0 partir de l'examen de la variation de ceux-ci parmi des sp\u00e9cimens topotypiques de Guyane fran\u00e7aise.",

Trees were climbed using French pole climbers (see Mori, 1987: fig. I-3A) , of which a small pair with a maximum toothto-tooth span of 25 cm and a larger pair spanning 35 cm were useful for climbing boles of different diameters. Wooden platforms provided with eyelets for raising and lowering trap assemblies by nylon lines were nailed to tree trunks 7-19 m above the ground in both well-drained and swampy primary forest. Each trap assembly consisted of one Tomahawk folding wire live trap (measuring 145 \u03eb 145 \u03eb 410 mm) and one piggybacked Sherman folding aluminum live trap (measuring 80 \u03eb 90 \u03eb 230 mm) attached to a wooden frame (fig. 5 ). Sherman traps were baited with the same oatmeal/peanut/raisin/ bacon mixture described previously, and the Tomahawk traps were baited with pieces of coconut and ripe plantain; bait was renewed as necessary, about every three to four days on average. Tree traps were checked daily soon after dawn with binoculars.",

Each pitfall trapline consisted of 11 buckets spaced 5 m apart, with one bucket at either end, for a total length of 50 m. Drift fences, consisting of a continuous barrier running the entire length of each trapline, were made of 50-cm-wide strips of heavyweight (6 mil) clear polyethylene stapled to vertical stakes hammered into the ground every 3-4 m.

However, we seldom hunted or made sight surveys in the daytime because mornings were occupied by checking traplines, taking down bat nets, or preparing specimens, and afternoons were usually spent rebaiting traps or setting up bat nets. Most of our personal observations of diurnal mammals at Paracou were therefore made haphazardly in the course of other (relatively noisy) activities. Fortunately, local forestry workers were familiar with most species of large diurnal mammals known or expected to occur in the area, so interviews compensated to some extent for the deficiencies of our diurnal census effort. By contrast, we regularly hunted at night, and we recorded many sightings of nocturnal species encountered by deliberate searching. Equipped with notebook, shotgun, and a nine-volt headlight with focusable reflector, we walked slowly (about 0.5-1.5 km/hour) along established trails scanning the vegetation with the headlight reflector adjusted to produce a moderately broad beam. When eyeshine was detected, we narrowed the beam to give brighter illumination; binoculars were sometimes used to identify animals revealed by eyeshine in the canopy or subcanopy. Most of our nocturnal surveys were made in the early evening (between 19:00 and 24:00 hours), but we also hunted between midnight and dawn on many nights. Some nonvolant species were observed in the course of bat netting, especially large marsupials attracted to the squeals of captured bats.",

We focused primarily on large species (\u05461 kg) that nonmammalogists might reasonably be expected to recognize without special effort, but we also asked about a few smaller species identifiable by obvious external characters. For each species expected to occur in the area but not observed by us, we asked if he had seen it himself, or whether the species had been seen by the forestry workers he supervised. If the species had been seen, we asked for details about where and when the sighting(s) occurred, and about distinguishing morphological or behavioral characteristics; we often used the illustrations in Emmons (1990) to discuss diagnostic differences among related species. For some species, we were able to examine photographs and/or written records (logs of noteworthy sightings on experimental plots).

Whereas most of the bat genera represented in the Paracou fauna have been revised taxonomically in the last half-century, very few revisions are available to facilitate the identification of nonvolant taxa. Furthermore, many of the unrevised nonvolant taxa in the Paracou fauna were first described by Linnaeus and other early zoologists, who often named species based on subsequently misplaced specimens, or on the unvouchered descriptions of even earlier travellers. Most of these names have been sources of taxonomic confusion for centuries, and it was found impossible to use them unambiguously without resolving difficult problems of conflicting usage. To do so, we examined types and other relevant material from many museums, and we now designate lectotypes or neotypes as necessary to fix the application of problematic names. For some species that lacked published syntheses of geographic data, we tried to examine every known specimen in order to map distributions for this report.",

Morphological support for caluromyid and marmosid monophyly is weak, however, and available molecular data consistently support other generic groupings (Patton et al., 1996; Palma and Spotorno, 1999; Jansa and Voss, 2000) . In the absence of a well-corroborated phylogenetic classification of New World marsupials, we continue the traditional usage of Didelphidae to include the entire didelphimorph crown group. Hershkovitz (1992 Hershkovitz ( , 1997 , but we adhere to the traditional interpretation of postcanine dental homologies (Flower, 1867; Luckett, 1993) , wherein the replaced molariform tooth of the upper and lower jaw is the deciduous third premolar (dP3/dp3). Thus, the adult didelphid dental formula is I 5/4, C 1/ 1, P 3/3, M 4/4). We define specimens to be juvenile if dP3 is still in place, subadult if dP3 has been shed but P3 and/or M4 are still incompletely erupted, and adult if the permanent maxillary dentition is complete.",

In particular, specimens from Trinidad and northern Venezuela formerly referred to C. trinitatis Thomas (type locality: ''Botanic Gardens, Trinidad'') are substantially smaller and differ from typical philander in coloration (Thomas, 1894 (Thomas, , 1903 (Thomas, , 1904 P\u00e9rez-Hern\u00e1ndez et al., 1994) . Furthermore, we have personally observed conspicuous variation in size and pelage traits among populations currently referred to C. philander from Amazonian Brazil. Although Cabrera (1958) recognized C. p. philander (including trinitatis as a synonym), C. p. affinis (type locality: Mato Grosso, Brazil), and C. p. dichrurus (type locality: ''Ypanema'', S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil) as valid subspecies, the empirical basis for a trinomial nomenclature has never been established. The material now available to evaluate geographic variation and subspecies (or species) limits within what might be called the Caluromys philander complex is too large to review in this faunal report, but from the close similarity noted above between Surinamese and French Guianan material it seems clear that the Paracou popu-NO. 263 BULLETIN AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY Measurements (mm) and Weights (g) of Adult Caluromys philander from Paracou lation is referable either to the nominate subspecies (if a trinomial nomenclature is warranted) or to C. philander sensu stricto (if additional species are recognized in this group).",

Persistent references (op. cit.) to brownish and yellowish tints in the pelage of Chironectes minimus are probably based on old (faded or stained) museum skins; living animals and fresh skins have clear black-and-gray dorsal markings and pure white venters, with no trace of other hues. According to Cabrera (1919) , the digits of the manus are webbed to the ends of the first phalanges, but our specimens (and those illustrated by Augustiny [1942: fig. 14] and Mondolfi and Medina [1957: fig. 1 ]) have unwebbed manual digits. The ''supernumerary facial bristles'' mentioned by Marshall (1978b) are the usual superciliary, genal, and interramal vibrissae (Brown, 1971) , which are well developed (Augustiny, 1942: fig. 11 ) but otherwise unremarkable in C. minimus.

Our material agrees in all qualitative details with Husson's (1978) description of Surinamese topotypes, but three of the four adults measured by Husson are larger than any collected at Paracou. To evaluate possible size differences, we borrowed Surinamese material for side-by-side comparisons with our vouchers; however, only four skin-and-skull preparations of adult specimens (all females) could be located. No differences in external characters were observed between Surinamese and French Guianan exemplars, and the measurement data we obtained (table 2) do not suggest any appreciable morphometric divergence. Considerable ontogenetic size variation is apparently characteristic of Didelphis species (Al-len, 1901 (Al-len, , 1902 Gardner, 1973) , and it seems likely that Husson's large specimens were just old animals that may have been preserved because of their unusual dimensions. The essential identity of the Surinamese and French Guianan material we examined supports the conclusions (hitherto undocumented by published comparisons) of Thomas (1888) and Allen (1902) that D. karkinophaga Zimmermann and D. cancrivora Gmelin (both based on ''Le Crabier'', an opossum described by Buffon from Cayenne) are junior synonyms of D. marsupialis.",

Of 21 specimens accompanied by habitat data, 11 (52%) were taken in clearings, roadside sec-ondary growth, or other disturbed habitats; the other 10 (48%) were taken in primary forest, at both well-drained and swampy sites. All specimens were shot or trapped at night, and all unvouchered sightings of Didelphis were also nocturnal.

Because the brief accounts by Thomas (1909) , Tate (1933) , Husson (1978) , and Hershkovitz (1992) are inadequate for evaluating morphological similarities and differences with other congeners, we redescribe the species below. TYPE MATERIAL: The holotype only, a male skin with skull and mandibles (BMNH 9.3.9.10) collected by Emilie Snethlage on 13 February 1909 at ''Para'' (\u03ed Bel\u00e9m, formerly known as Par\u00e1), Brazil. The type was described by Thomas (1909: 379) as a ''subadult'', by Tate (1933: 189) as a ''young adult'', and by Hershkovitz (1992: 33 ) as a ''juvenal''. The animal is, in fact, very nearly adult with P3 and M4 both erupted but still a little below their adult positions in the toothrow. Pine (1981: 59) suggested that the type locality should be construed as the state of Par\u00e1 rather than the formerly eponymous city, but Thomas (always scrupulous about type localities) would surely have noted the lack of definite geographic information if he meant ''Para'' in the sense of a district larger than most European countries. A specimen collected at Capim (ca. 90 km ESE of Bel\u00e9m) provides independent evidence that the species may occur in the environs of the city. DISTRIBUTION: Specimens that we examined document the presence of Gracilinanus emiliae in eastern Colombia, eastern Venezuela, southern Guyana, northern Surinam, northern French Guiana, and eastern Brazil ( fig. 10 ). Several other published localities for this species are erroneous or unreliable (see Remarks, below).",

Marmosa lepida (not known to occur at Paracou but reported from other localities in French Guiana and Surinam; appendix 1) is also externally similar to G. emiliae. Although adults of M. lepida are much larger than G. emiliae, immature specimens of the former species might be almost impossible to distinguish from the latter in the field. Cranially, adult M. lepida (see Husson, 1978: pl. 11 ) can be identified by their (1) distinctively longer premaxillary rostral processes, (2) prominent postorbital frontal processes, (3) lack of posteromedial palatal vacuities, (4) lack of anteromedial bullar processes, and (5) lack of mastoid exposure between the squamosal and parietal bones. Skulls of juvenile M. lepida that lack postorbital frontal processes can still be distinguished from G. emiliae by rostral, palatal, and bullar morphology, and by tooth size (see under Remarks, below). REMARKS: Originally described as Marmosa emiliae (Thomas, 1909) , this species was subsequently referred to Didelphis (subgenus Grymaeomys) by Matschie (1916) , and to Marmosa (subgenus Thylamys) by Cabrera (1958) . The current allocation of emiliae to Gracilinanus follows Gardner and Creighton (1989) .",

However, the black mask of FMNH 87924 does, in fact, completely encircle the eye (a narrow border of black hairs is continuous below the lower lid and around the posterior canthus), and the other characters cited as diagnostic for longicaudus are matched by the type (and other referred specimens) of emiliae. Our side-by-side compar-isons of AMNH 203363 (an adult male skin and skull from Capim, Brazil) with the holotype of emiliae in London and, later, with the holotype of longicaudus in Chicago, revealed no differences beyond those that might be expected among individuals from a single local population (for measurements, see table 3).

Among other differences, Gracilinanus microtarsus is much larger and has a proportionately much shorter tail (see measurements in Tate, 1933; Hershkovitz, 1992) , the ventral fur is buffy and gray-based, the supraorbital margins are not beaded, and the crowns of I2-5 increase in size from front to back. Gardner and Creighton (1989) , Hershkovitz (1992) , and Gardner (1993) listed Marmosa agricolai Moojen (1943) as a synonym of Gracilinanus emiliae, but Moojen's illustration (op. cit.: fig. 1 ) and description are difficult to reconcile with this decision: the ratio of tail to head-and-body for agricolai is only 1.28, the maxillary-premaxillary suture (as drawn) does not extend anteriorly to I5, the frontals are shown without supraorbital beads, the zygomatic arches are widely flared, the illustrated bullae appear to lack anteromedial processes, the upper canine appears to have a small anterior accessory cusp, and the third upper premolar (as drawn) is larger than the second. The type of agricolai (in Rio de Janeiro) should be reexamined to evaluate the true status and relationships of this nominal species.",

Eyes very large. Throat glands apparently absent. 4 4 Throat glands in murine opossums are indicated by a midventral gular patch of pigmented hair or bare skin (Tate, 1933) . Although Hershkovitz (1992: 11) remarked that ''neither marker is present in the two females of G. kalinowskii'', the paratype (FMNH 65754) was subsequently described as resembling the holotype externally ''but with gular gland evident'' (op. cit.: 38). We care-Wrists, ankles, and dorsal surface of metapodials covered with short, orange fur; manus and pes each with six plantar pads (thenar, hypothenar, and four interdigitals), the thenar and first interdigital touching but not fused on either manus or pes; central palmar surface smooth (not densely tubercular); claws of manual digits II-V large, extending beyond fleshy apical pads. Scrotum (of one adult male, AMNH 267338) pigmented, fully examined the throat of FMNH 65754 under a dissecting microscope and found no external trace of glandular development. No discolored fur or bare patches are present on the throats of any of the four fluid specimens we examined from the Guianas. VOSS ET AL.: RAINFOREST MAMMAL FAUNA Measurements (mm) and Weights (g) of Adult Specimens of Hyladelphys kalinowskii blue. Mammae 2-0-2 \u03ed 4, in two abdominal-inguinal pairs (without an unpaired median teat; fig. 15 ). 5 Tail not very long and without furry base; dark (brownish) above and below, but indistinctly banded by absence of pigment over vertebral articulations. Caudal epidermis scaly beneath sparse covering of fine hairs; caudal scales in annular or spiral series, numbering about 25-35 rows/cm at middle of tail (counts from four fluid specimens). Median hair of triplet emerging from posterior margin of each scale usually about three scale rows long, thicker than lateral hairs but not grossly flattened or petiolate. 5 Hershkovitz (1992: 37) gave the mammary formula of kalinowskii as 7-1-7 \u03ed 15. This notation corresponds to what he described earlier (op. cit.: 11) as the ''. . . prime formula for Gracilinanus . . . of which the pectoral is 2-0-2 \u03ed 4, the abdominal-inguinal, 5-1-5 \u03ed 11. The functional teat formula may be the same or less, depending on the number of attached young. Unused nipples are more-or-less resorbed'' (italics original). Contrary to this last assertion, however, unused teats remain everted and are not ''resorbed'' in adult female marsupials (Bresslau, 1920; Tyndale-Biscoe and Renfree, 1987) . Although unused teats are smaller than actively lactating teats, accurate mammary counts can be obtained even from anestrous adults. All of the five adult females of Hyladelphys kalinowskii that we examined have four well-developed mammae in two abdominalinguinal pairs; no other mammary loci were apparent, even with careful searching under high magnification.",

The Peruvian specimens are slightly larger than French Guianan material (table 4) , but the apparent size difference (perhaps best indexed by molar measurements) is no more than might be expected of conspecific samples collected almost 3000 km apart. The alisphenoid bullae of the holotype and of all four specimens from the Guianas lack anteromedial processes, but weakly developed processes (which are not fused to the floor of the braincase as they normally are in Gracilinanus, Marmosops, and Thylamys) are present on the anteromedial aspect of both alisphenoid bullae of the paratype.

As far as is known, well-preserved adult females of other didelphid taxa uniformly ex-hibit odd-numbered mammary counts due to the presence of an unpaired median teat (fig. 15B); by contrast, caenolestids, microbiotheriids, and Old World marsupials have evennumbered mammary counts because their teats are bilaterally paired (Bresslau, 1920; Osgood, 1921 Osgood, , 1943 Tate, 1933 Tate, , 1947 Tate, , 1948 . All reports of even-numbered didel- phid mammary counts that we investigated were either field observations of lactating teats only (e.g., Hershkovitz, 1997: table 4) , or were observations from specimens with midventral incisions that might have destroyed the median nipple (e.g., Marshall's [1978a] count of four mammae from an FMNH skin of Glironia venusta; W. T. Stanley, personal commun.). By contrast, our observations of identical (2-0-2 \u03ed 4) mam-mary configurations in two Hyladelphys skins from Peru and two fluid-preserved specimens from French Guiana suggest that these are not rare variants or preservational artifacts. Instead, this taxon appears to be genuinely divergent from other didelphids in a character that displays considerable highertaxonomic stability among marsupials.",

Gracilinanus emiliae differs from H. kalinowskii in facial markings (its black fa-cial mask does not extend to the base of the ear, and the streak of orange fur between its eyes is darker and narrower) and has smaller ears, smaller manual claws (not extending beyond the fleshy digital pads), 4-1-4 \u03ed 9 mammae, and a much longer tail with smaller scales and no trace of lighter banding over the vertebral articulations. Another external character that might distinguish G. emiliae and H. kalinowskii is the presence/absence of gular glands, but the variability of this trait within species is not well documented and, with so few examples available for comparison, its diagnostic value is uncertain. The skull of G. emiliae differs from that of H. kalinowskii in the cranial characters listed above for Gracilinanus and by the presence of a posterior accessory cusp on the upper canine (a trait not consistently exhibited by other congeners).",

The bulging eyes of our fluid-preserved specimens are proportionately about twice as large as those in the drawing. The pinnae in the illustration are shown bristling with short hairs, but the auricular pelage is actually microscopic and the unmagnified ears appear quite naked; the ears in life are also proportionately much larger than drawn. The portrait does not show the genal vibrissae, but these long black hairs are conspicuous against the short white fur of the cheeks in all of the specimens at hand. The mystacial vibrissae are depicted as fine, inconspicuous hairs that extend only to the outer canthus of the eye, but these robust whiskers actually extend nearly to the tips of the pinnae when laid back along the side of the head. The facial markings in the portrait also lack the vivid definition characteristic of this species: the mask is intensely black in fresh specimens and is boldly accentuated by a broad streak of very pale orange fur down the midline of the rostrum.",

                "text": "We examined the western Ecuadorean specimen (KU 135097) that Hershkovitz (1992: 42) identified as ''Gracilinanus sp. (new species)'' and that he subsequently (op. cit.: 45) conjectured ''. . . is most nearly like adult Gracilinanus kalinowskii . . . ''. The animal in question is a juvenile male (not a female as originally reported) preserved in fluid with an extracted skull, of which the first upper molar (crown length \u03ed 2.26 mm) suggests an adult size far larger than that of Hyladelphys or any known species of Gracilinanus. The large size of its caudal scales, absence of posteromedial palatal vacuities, and absence of an anteromedial alisphenoid strut bridging the foramen ovale are additional traits that cannot be reconciled with Gardner and Creighton's (1989) diagnosis of Gracilinanus. From Hyladelphys, KU 135097 differs conspicuously by its well-developed rostral process of the premaxillae, well-developed postorbital jugal process, upper incisor morphology (I1-5 have large, overlapping, symmetrically rhomboidal crowns that increase in size from front to back), fully molariform dP3, and highly carnassialized molars. Based on these and other attributes, we refer this specimen to the genus Marmosa (sensu Gardner and Creighton, 1989) , within which it most closely resem- bles M. mimetra Thomas (1921) and other nominal taxa currently synonymized (Gardner, 1993) (1933) and Husson's (1978) authoritative descriptions of this species, the type locality of which was restricted by Thomas (1911a) to Surinam. According to Tate (1933: 95) , two subspecies are parapatrically distributed in Surinam and French Guiana: supposedly, Marmosa murina murina ranges ''along the narrow coastal strip between the sea and the heavy rainforest'', whereas ''in the rainforest it is replaced by the smaller darker [M. m.] muscula [(Cabanis) ].'' Husson (1978) , however, recognized only the former taxon in his Surinamese material, and all of the Surinamese specimens that we examined appear to represent a single recognizable form-closely conforming to Husson's description and resembling our Paracou vouchers in qualitative characters and measurements (table 6)that we assume to represent typical M. murina. Unfortunately, possible character differences between the types of murina and muscula are now difficult to evaluate. Thomas (1892) identified two syntypes of Didelphys murina Linnaeus (1758) among the specimens of the Lidth de Jeude collection purchased by the BMNH in 1867. One of these (BMNH 67.4.12.542) was designated as the lectotype by Husson (1978) , but his choice was unfortunate: the lectotype is a fluid-preserved adult female from which the skull has been extracted and apparently lost. The skull of the adult male paralectotype NO. 263 BULLETIN AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY Measurements (mm) and Weights (g) of Adult Marmosa murina from French Guiana and Surinam (BMNH 67.4.12.541), however, has measurements that fall within the range of variation that we observed among recently collected specimens from Surinam (table 6) . Tate (1933) described the pelage color of BMNH 67.4.12.541 in considerable detail, but neither this specimen nor the lectotype are really suitable for subspecific color comparisons because their pigments may have faded after more than two centuries in alcohol. The holotype of Marmosa murina muscula (type locality: ''Caraiben Niederlassung Arrai am obern Pomeroon'' [Cabanis, 1848: 778] , Pomeroon-Supenaam, Guyana) is a juvenile specimen (with dP3 in place and M4 unerupted) that consists of the skin and skull of an animal originally preserved in fluid. Because of its immaturity, and because the pelage is now faded from preservative and discolored by age, the type of muscula is likewise unsuitable for subspecific comparisons. A small series of skins from Kartabo, Guyana, that Tate (1933) identified as M. m. muscula, however, are dorsally somewhat darker than our Paracou vouchers, but have whiter venters with less extensive lateral zones of gray-based fur. Whereas the dorsal color difference is consistent with Tate's diagnosis of muscula versus murina, the ventral color difference is not. The only qualitative cranial character cited by Tate as diagnostic of muscula, the absence of dorsal grooves along the supraorbital ridges, is apparently useless for defining this taxon (as represented by Tate's own identifications) inasmuch as all the fully adult skulls from the Kartabo series (AMNH 42908, 48135, 99983, 142807) have grooved supraorbital ridges. Given that (1) the other character differences between murina and muscula cited by Tate are indefinite, (2) that the relevant types have discolored pelage and are incommensurate in age, and (3) that the material we examined from Surinam and French Guiana shows no appreciable divergence in size or coat color between coastal and interior populations, it does not seem useful to recognize these subspecies as valid at the present time.",

All of these are chiefly distinguishable by pelage characters-subtle differences in fur color, length, and texture-that perhaps vary clinally with environmental conditions as suggested by Tate himself (1933, 1939) , who ranked them as no more than subspecifically distinct. By contrast, the conspecificity of some taxa from outside the Guiana subregion that are currently referred to M. murina (e.g., by Gardner, 1993) is more problematic. For example, M. quichua Thomas (1899a) from western Amazonia is craniodentally distinctive (Tate, 1933; personal obs.) and no justification for its synonymy with M. murina has apparently been published. In view of the lack of any critical review of the species-level taxonomy of Marmosa (sensu stricto) since Tate's 1933 monograph , that work should still be considered the primary authority for species limits until compelling evidence is provided for alternative classifications.",

Ventral pattern was classed as ''narrow'' if self-colored (pure white or cream) fur was confined to the midline (sometimes as a discontinuous streak) by a broad zone of gray-based fur on each side, ''broad'' if almost the entire ventrum was self-colored, or ''intermediate'' for speciever, retain their original colors: AMNH 266423, 267007, and 267352 have ''fuscous'' dorsal fur and ''white'' underparts; AMNH 266426 has ''reddish'' dorsal fur and ''cream'' underparts; and AMNH 267817 has ''reddish'' dorsal fur and ''white'' underparts.

Other external and craniodental measurements showed no significant divergence. Not surprisingly, principal components analysis of the log-transformed craniodental measurement data provides clear separation of dorsal fur color classes aligned with the first eigenvector ( fig. 24 ), the coefficients of which (table 8) reflect essentially the same differences as those indicated by univariate statistics: fuscous adult males have taller canines, broader nasals, and wider zygomas than do reddish adult males, with smaller (but still substantial) differences in molar size and palatal breadth. Similar morphometric contrasts between dorsal fur color classes can be seen among the few adult females in our sample, and among immatures. Close inspection of skulls revealed another difference between the two groups of specimens previously sorted by chromatic and morphometric traits. In specimens with fuscous dorsal fur, taller canines, and broader skulls, the lacrimal bone forms a prominent part of the anteroventral margin of the orbit; the lacrimal foramina then perforate the orbital margin, where they are exposed in lateral view ( fig. 25B ). By contrast, the lacrimal bone is not a prominent part of the anteroventral orbital margin in specimens with reddish dorsal fur, smaller teeth, and narrower skulls; in these, the lacrimal foramina are always located within the orbit, where they are more-or-less concealed from lateral view ( fig. 25A ).",

                "text": "IDENTIFICATION: Specimens of Marmosops parvidens can be distinguished from sympatric examples of M. pinheiroi at Paracou by their warmer (more reddish) dorsal fur, broader extent of self-colored fur (which is never discontinuous between chin and anus), smaller teeth (especially upper canines), narrower skull, and by the reduced lacrimal contribution to the anteroventral orbital margin (see above). Because the difference in dorsal pelage color is subtle, and because there is some overlapping variation in the extent of self-colored ventral fur, unambiguous species identifications require cleaned cranial material. In our voucher series, height of canine (HC) affords the clearest discrimination (tables 9, 10), but toothwear and sexual dimorphism must be taken into account in sorting specimens by this criterion. Lacrimal morphology ( fig. 25 ) is perhaps the most reliable cranial character for identifying juveniles with incompletely erupted (and therefore unmeasurable) canines. Although a revision of what may be called the parvidens group of Marmosops is beyond the scope of this faunal report, we note that our conclusion that two species assignable to this complex are sympatric at Paracou is consistent with recent molecular evidence that M. parvidens sensu Pine (1981) is composite Patton et al., 2000) . In addition to recognizing M. pinheiroi as a valid species, we note that M. juninensis (another ''subspecies'' of M. parvi- In M. pinheiroi the lacrimal bone forms a larger part of the orbital margin, and the lacrimal foramina (lf) are laterally exposed.",

Jun\u00edn, Peru) can be unambiguously distinguished from M. parvidens (sensu stricto) and M. pinheiroi by the size and shape of the male carpal tubercle (smaller and not spoon-shaped), by the consistent presence of posteromedial palatal vacuities, and by the absence of distinct accessory cusps on the upper canine ( fig. 26 ).

The mystacial vibrissae of USNM 371299 appear to be very short, probably not extending much if at all beyond the base of the ear in life, whereas the mystacial hairs reach at least to the posterior margins of the pinnae in typical examples of M. parvidens.

Cabrera (1958) , however, considered demerarae to be a subspecies of cinerea, citing doubts that Tate (1939: 164, footnote 2) expressed about his own prior classification. The current allocation of Tate's cinerea group to Micoureus follows Gardner and Creighton (1989) . Among the many nominal taxa now synonymized with Micoureus demerarae (sensu Gardner, 1993) are several that Tate (1933) recognized as full species, all or some of which may yet prove to be valid (Patton et al., 2000) . With the extensive series of specimens now available to evaluate the taxonomy of this widespread complex, the group is ripe for modern revisionary treatment.",

The material we examined exhibits considerable geographic variation in pelage color, the taxonomic significance of which is difficult to evaluate. Possibly, pelage color may reflect species-level divergence that is not apparent in craniodental characters, but the material currently available is insufficient to determine whether chromatic variation is clinal or discontinuous. The following observations are intended to establish which of the above names is applicable to the coat-color phenotype represented by our Paracou voucher, not to revise the nomenclature of the entire brevicaudata complex, a task beyond the scope of this report. Erxleben's (1777) Thomas, 1892) is therefore the type of both brevicaudata and brachyuros, so these nominal taxa are objective synonyms (for the priority of Erxleben's name see Thomas, 1888: 356) . We examined BMNH 67.4.12.540, an adult female preserved in fluid with an extracted skull. Despite more than two centuries in preservative, this specimen is in re-markably good condition and the apparently unfaded pelage is distinctly bicolored (reddish dorsally and abruptly paler ventrally), exactly as described by Seba, Erxleben, and Schreber; there is no middorsal stripe of grizzled-brownish, -grayish, or -blackish fur. Although Matschie (1916) restricted the type locality of Monodelphis brevicaudata to Surinam, bicolored specimens resembling the type are only known from the interfluvial region between the lower Caroni-Orinoco and the lower Mazaruni-Essequibo in northeastern Venezuela and northwestern Guyana ( fig.  28 ). Because Matschie's restriction was obviously erroneous, we hereby emend the type locality to the vicinity of Kartabo, Cuyuni-Mazaruni District, Guyana (locality 15 in fig.  28 ), from which a well-preserved bicolored specimen (AMNH 48133) closely resembling the type was collected by William Beebe in 1919. 8 By contrast with the limited geographic distribution of bicolored animals, tricolored specimens of Monodelphis brevicaudata have been collected throughout French Guiana, Surinam, Guyana, Guianan Venezuela (south and east of the Orinoco), and Guianan Brazil (north of the Amazon and east of the Rio Negro). In fully adult examples of this coat-color phenotype, a broad middorsal stripe of grizzled-brownish, -grayish, or -blackish fur is sharply set off from the clear (ungrizzled) reddish flanks, which are separated by a similarly abrupt transition from the pale (whitish, cream, or buffy, but sometimes partly gray-based) ventral fur. Whereas tricolored skins from Brazil and the Guianas are often brightly colored (with blackish or grayish middorsal stripes and cream or whitish venters), most tricolored Venezuelan skins have brownish middorsal stripes and buffy venters that exhibit less chromatic contrast with the reddish flanks. Despite Husson's (1978) remark that his Surinamese specimens represented a full range 8 Kyk-over-al, a small island opposite Kartabo at the confluence of the Cuyuni and Mazaruni Rivers, was the seat of government of the Dutch colony of Essequibo from the early 1600s until 1740 (Beebe, 1925) . The environs of Kartabo (Kartabu Point on recent maps; 6\u040a23\u0408N, 58\u040a41\u0408W) are therefore a plausible source of some of the South American material assembled by Albert Seba (b.1665 Seba (b. , d.1736 Engel, 1937) in Amsterdam.",

The appropriate trinomial, if one is needed, for our Paracou voucher is therefore M. b. touan. Unfortunately, the application of the name touan has been a persistent source of confusion in the literature. Thomas (1888) and Cabrera (1919) regarded touan as a synonym of brevicaudata, but Cabrera (1958) listed touan (without comment) as a distinct species that included such divergent forms as emiliae, paulensis, and rubida as subspecies. Current usage (Gardner, 1993) recognizes M. emiliae, M. rubida, and M. sorex (including paulensis) as full species that can be distinguished from M. brevicaudata by trenchant craniodental characters (e.g., those described by Pine and Handley, 1984) .",

Both studies, however, referred Guianan populations of gray four-eyed opossums to P. opossum, the type locality of which (as restricted by Matschie, 1916) is Paramaribo, Surinam. Our Paracou vouchers agree closely with Husson's (1978) description of topotypic specimens of P. opossum in most details, but a few discrepancies merit comment. (1) Whereas Husson described the pelage of his topotypes as usually distinctly darker middorsally than on the sides, only one skin from Paracou (AMNH 266995) has fur that is slightly darker middorsally than on the sides; the rest of the adult and subadult skins from Paracou are a uniform grizzledgray over the entire dorsum. (2) Husson (1978: 25) described the fur of the head as ''of the same dark blackish-brown colour as the median part of the back or even slightly darker'', but the blackish fur of the head contrasts conspicuously with the grizzled-gray back in all adult and subadult Paracou skins, even the aforementioned example with darker middorsal fur. (3) Husson (1978: 26) described the ears as ''whitish with a broad black rim'', but the ears of our Paracou specimens are only whitish at the base-most of the pinna is black. 4Husson's juvenile specimens were described as darker than adults and with less distinct facial markings, but three juvenile skins from Paracou (AMNH 266385, 266391, 266997) are comparable to those of adults and subadults except in pelage texture (the juvenile fur is softer).",

We examined the Surinamese specimens that he cited as coat-color exemplars, however, and did not observe any consistent differences between gray and ''brown'' individuals (e.g., between FMNH 95312 and 95313, both collected by H. A. Beatty in the Wilhelmina Mountains). Yellowish or brownish tints do occur in some Philander skins, but whether these represent true coat-color variants rather than preservational artifacts (e.g., staining by sebaceous secretions or subcutaneous fat) is difficult to determine with the material at hand. Both Patton and da Silva (1997) and Hershkovitz (1997) referred French Guianan populations of Philander opossum to the nominate form P. o. opossum, a usage consistent with the results of our comparisons. According to these authors, the nominate race occurs throughout the Guianas and the eastern Amazon basin of Brazil, and differs from other subspecies principally by geographic variation in size and pelage color. However, whereas Patton and da Silva recognized four species of Philander (see above), Hershkovitz recognized only P. opossum (including frenata among other subspecies) and P. andersoni (including mcilhennyi as a subspecies). We follow Patton and da Silva in recognizing the gray foureyed opossum of the Brazilian Atlantic forest as a distinct species, P. frenata, and we interpret their phylogenetic analysis of mtDNA sequences as evidence that additional taxa currently treated as subspecies of P. opossum (e.g., canus and fuscogriseus) might also be recognized as full species. However, many nominal taxa were not represented in Patton and da Silva's molecular analyses, and several important issues of species-level synonymy remain unresolved. Therefore, the geographic limits of P. opossum are still uncertain.",

Hershkovitz (1976: 297 ) designated Seba's female as the lectotype, but the specimen itself was apparently not then known to have survived the breakup and dispersion of Seba's museum (for the history of which, see Boeseman, 1970) . Hershkovitz (1997) subsequently stated that the lectotype is still preserved as an alcoholic specimen in the Rijksmuseum van Naturlijke Historie in Leiden. 11 According to the current RMNH curator of mammals (C. Smeenk, personal commun.), the lectotype is RMNH 25421, clearly recognizable as the adult female with three pouch young illustrated and described by Seba. OTHER SPECIMENS EXAMINED:",

One juvenile captured in a pitfall trap and another taken in a Sherman trap were released. Of all 50 records, 31 (62%) were of individuals shot, trapped, or sighted on the ground, whereas 19 (38%) were of individuals shot, trapped, caught by hand, or sighted in trees (or on other elevated substrates such as inclined trunks, lianas, etc.) from 1.5 to 6 m above the ground. With the exception of females carrying nursing young, all P. opossum that we encountered were solitary, and all were collected or sighted at night. Of 49 records accompanied by habitat data, 32 (65%) were of individuals encountered in primary forest, usually near streams or in swamps, but occasionally at well-drained sites; 17 observations (35%), however, were based on individuals encountered in roadside secondary growth or other more-or-less disturbed habitats.",

IDENTIFICATION: Although the species-level taxonomy of two-toed sloths, genus Choloepus, has never been formally revised, two species are consistently recognized in modern synoptic treatments of edentate classification (e.g., Wetzel and \u00c1 vila-Pires, 1980; Wetzel, 1982 Wetzel, , 1985 ; of these, only C. didactylus is known to occur in the Guiana subregion of Amazonia. Our voucher material conforms with the brief description of topotypic specimens of C. didactylus from Surinam provided by Husson (1978) , and with the cranial diagnosis of this species provided by Wetzel (1985) . However, the fur on the throat of our adult female specimen (AMNH 265952) is distinctly paler and shorter than the pectoral fur, a pelage trait that Wetzel regarded as diagnostic of C. hoffmanni (from western Amazonia and Central America). The throat fur of our juvenile male (MNHN 1995.952 ) is likewise paler than the chest fur, but the contrast is less marked than in the adult female. For comparison with Surinamese topotypes measured by Husson (1978: table 38) , external measurements of our adult female voucher were 698 \u03eb 12 \u03eb 164 \u03eb 29 mm, and it weighed 7.3 kg. Selected cranial measurements of this specimen are: condylobasal length (''greatest length of skull''), 119.1 mm; zygomatic breadth, 73.0 mm; interorbital constriction, 36.3 mm; alveolar length of maxillary toothrow, 44.5 mm. The ratio of the minimal to the maximal interpterygoid width (after Wetzel, 1985) in this specimen is 0.49.",

Of five sightings by inventory personnel from 1991 to 1994, four were nocturnal and one was diurnal: (1) RSV found a lactating female and a juvenile male (the vouchers described above) hanging together motionless in subcanopy vegetation (ca. 20 m above the ground) in well-drained primary forest at 20: 15 hours on 30 July 1991. (2) RSV found a large adult of undetermined sex descending a tree head-first (probably to defecate) in well-drained primary forest at ca. 23:00 hours on 6 August 1991; the animal was about 2 m above the ground and remained motionless throughout the encounter (about 10 min), even when touched; its eyeshine was very faint. (3) RSV saw another solitary adult of unknown sex sleeping suspended from a liana ca. 4 m above the ground in old secondary growth at 02:00 hours on 31 July 1993. 4 Cabassous unicinctus (Linnaeus) The only record of this elusive armadillo at Paracou is an infant specimen (with unopened eyes) excavated by a bulldozer when a tract of well-drained primary forest was being cleared for a new experimental plantation; forestry workers brought the animal to P.

Geoffroy. Confusingly, the holotype of niger was clearly stated to have come from Cayenne (Geoffroy, 1803), far from the known range of black-handed tamarins. Although Hershkovitz reassigned the type locality to Bel\u00e9m, he did not examine Geoffroy's specimen, the identity of which is obviously problematic. Unfortunately, the holotype of niger (No. XXIV in Geoffroy's catalog) is lost: it was not listed in Rode's (1938) catalog of MNHN primate types, and it is not part of the current Paris museum collection (M. Tranier, personal commun.). Whether the original specimen of Geoffroy's niger was a melanistic individual of the golden-handed species collected at Cayenne or was a mislabelled example of the blackhanded species is now impossible to determine. Nevertheless, the black-handed species is now widely and consistently known by the epithet niger E. Geoffroy, a usage that should be preserved in the interest of taxonomic stability. For that purpose, we hereby designate as neotype of Sagouin niger E. Geoffroy, 1803, an adult male specimen represented by a well-preserved skin and skull in the American Museum of Natural History, AMNH 96500, collected by A. M. Olalla on 2 November 1931 at Camet\u00e1 on the Rio Tocantins, Par\u00e1, Brazil, from which locality a large series of topotypes is also available.",

(1) According to Husson, a few Surinamese examples have ''very inconspicuous buffy yellow postauric-ular patches'', but most do not; there is no trace of a postauricular patch on any specimen from Paracou. (2) Husson described the ventral coloration as ''usually pale reddish brown, sharply separated from the colour of the dorsal surface, at least in about the middle of the body, but considerably less so in the anterior and posterior parts''. By contrast, Paracou skins have clear (self-colored) orange fur on the chest, fading to buff or cream on the throat; some clear orange fur extends posteriorly along the ventral midline onto the abdomen, but most of the abdominal fur is gray-based, appearing grizzled like the flanks although much paler. (3) Some Surinamese specimens have substantially smaller measurements (op. cit.: table 62) than our vouchers (table 17) , but it is possible that Husson included subadults in his sample.",

The identification of spiny mice from the Guiana subregion of Amazonia is a case in point: although these have traditionally been identified as N. guianae (e.g., by Anthony, 1921a; Tate, 1939; Carvahlo, 1962; Husson, 1978; Genoways et al., 1981; Guillotin, 1982; Malcolm, 1990; Voss and Emmons, 1996) , the diagnostic morphological characters and geographic range of this species are not documented in the literature. In his original description, Thomas (1905: 310) compared N. guianae only with N. spinosus (Thomas, 1882) , stating that the new species was very similar but ''conspicuously smaller''. However, size does not distinguish guianae from such other diminutive forms as tenuipes Thomas (1900) , pusillus Allen (1912) , and pictus Goldman (1912) . Musser and Carleton (1993) listed N. guianae, N. pictus, N. spinosus, and N. tenuipes (including pusillus) as valid species, but the recent description of two additional species from western Amazonia (N. minutus and N. musseri), together with sequence comparisons showing high levels of genetic differentiation among several undescribed mtDNA clades of spiny mice, suggests that the genus is much more diverse than previously recognized (Patton et al., 2000) .",

We tried to locate every Guianan Neacomys specimen currently housed in North American and European museums, and we measured representative series to document morphometric variation within and among species. The results of our comparisons indicate that at least three distinct species are present in the Guiana subregion of Amazonia, of which two are new and occur sympatrically at Paracou. Because the very brief diagnoses of Neacomys provided by Thomas (1900) , Gyldenstolpe (1932) , and Ellerman (1941) are now insufficient as a basis for taxonomic inference, we rediagnose the genus here.",

We are also grateful for his original suggestion of Paracou as the site for our mammal inventory, and for his subsequent support and advice throughout the course of our fieldwork there. DIAGNOSIS: A small species of Neacomys (measurements in table 18) distinguished from other diminutive congeners by its short, usually unicolored tail; moderately short rostrum flanked by relatively shallow zygomatic notches; broad and strongly convergent interorbital region with highly developed, shelf-like supraorbital beads; broad and distinctly inflated braincase; short, convex-sided incisive foramina; carotid circulation pattern 1; M1 with undivided anterocone; mesoloph of M1 with more-or-less symmetrical connections to protocone and hypocone; persistently tubercular molar cusps; and a distinctive range of craniometric variation.",

Superciliary, genal, and some mystacial vibrissae extend behind pinnae when laid back against head. Dorsal surface of manus and pes covered by short pale fur in most specimens, but hairs over central metapodials sometimes indistinctly darker than those on digits and outer metapodials; claw of pedal digit I extending about one-half length of phalange 1 of adjacent digit II; claw of pedal digit V extending to but not beyond end of first phalange of adjacent digit IV; small but distinct hypothenar (lateral tarsal) plantar pad present on hindfoot of one fluid specimen (this trait is difficult to score reliably on dried skins). Tail about as long as combined length of head-and-body; almost always unicolored (dark above and below), but occasionally indistinctly paler ventrally at base (e.g., CM 76842, MNHN 1972.641); with small caudal scales (21 rows/cm near base of tail in one NO. 263 BULLETIN AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY Measurements (mm) and Weights (g) of Neacomys dubosti fluid specimen) forming relatively narrow annulations.",

MORPHOLOGICAL DESCRIPTION: Dorsal pelage coarsely grizzled tawny-or reddishbrown, somewhat paler along sides due to middorsal concentration of dark-tipped spines; ventral fur abruptly paler, often pure white from chin to anus, but sometimes with orange pectoral markings (e.g., AMNH 266548), or broadly suffused with orange (e.g., CM 76845); ventral hairs pale to roots in most specimens (rarely with indistinctly gray bases between the fore-and hindlegs; e.g., AMNH 266545); broad lateral line of clear buff or orange separating dorsal and ventral pelage in many specimens, but lateral line narrow or absent in others (e.g., AMNH 266542, CM 76844, MNHN 1986.285 ). Superciliary and genal vibrissae extending behind pinnae when laid back alongside head, but mystacial vibrissae consistently shorter, not extending much if at all behind pinnae on properly made-up skins. Dorsal surface of manus and pes covered with short pale fur, often with indistinctly darker markings over central metapodials; claw of pedal digit I extending less than one-half length of phalange 1 of adjacent digit II; claw of pedal digit V extending no more than three-fourths length of phalange 1 of adjacent digit IV; hypothenar (lateral metatarsal) plantar pad small but distinct in some specimens, indistinct or absent in others. Tail about as long as, or a little shorter than, combined length of head-andbody; unicolored (dark above and below), rarely indistinctly paler ventrally at base (e.g., AMNH 266548); with large caudal scales (15-18 rows/cm near the base of the tail in nine fluid specimens) forming coarse and conspicuous annulations. Skull with very short rostrum flanked by moderately deep zygomatic notches; interorbital region broad and usually strongly convergent; supraorbital beads well developed, often projecting as small shelves over posterior orbits and continuing onto braincase as low temporal crests; braincase relatively narrow in most specimens and not conspicuously inflated. Incisive foramina relatively long (averaging about 65% of diastemal length) and narrow, usually with more-or-less parallel lateral margins; zygo-matic plate relatively broad; carotid circulation with well-developed supraorbital ramus of stapedial artery (occupying squamosal-alisphenoid groove and sphenofrontal foramen; pattern 1 of Voss, 1988) ; subsquamosal fenestra often very small and sometimes occluded by internal flange of petrosal; auditory bullae usually globular, with spherical tympanic capsules and abruptly constricted bony eustacian tubes.",

The same diploid counts were obtained by E. Bach from chromosomal preparations of two Venezuelan specimens Fig. 38 . Dorsal views and cross-sections of the interorbital region in Neacomys tenuipes (A, FMNH 71778) and N. dubosti (B, AMNH 267569, holotype). In most examined specimens of N. tenuipes, the interorbital region is relatively narrow and uninflated, with weakly convergent supraorbital margins; the supraorbital beads are usually strongly reflected and seldom form projecting shelves. By contrast, the interorbital region of N. dubosti is typically broader and more inflated, the supraorbital margins are more strongly convergent, and the supraorbital beads are more frequently developed as projecting shelves.",

Of these, dubosti, guianae, and paracou occur in the Guiana subregion of Amazonia, where they have been collected sympatrically in all pairwise combinations (but never all three together). Neacomys tenuipes does not occur in the Guiana subregion, but its nomenclaturally crucial status as the oldest named species of small spiny mice compels us to include it in this comparative analysis. Although all small species of spiny mice are similar in most external characters, the morphology of the hindfoot and the tail can be used in combination to provide tentative field identifications. In tenuipes and dubosti, the outer pedal digits (dI and dV) are relatively long: the claw of dI extends almost or fully half the length of the first phalange of dII, and the claw of dV extends almost or fully to the end of the first phalange of dIV. By contrast, the claw of dI does not extend much beyond the base of the first phalange of dII in guianae and paracou, and the claw of dV in these two species does not extend more than about half the length of the first phalange of dIV. These proportional differences are easiest to see in fresh material, or in fluids, where the digits can be straightened and freely manipulated; in carelessly madeup skins (with twisted or bent toes), however, digital proportions can be hard to evaluate.",

Unfortunately, the ratio of tail to head-and-body cannot be compared meaningfully among specimens measured by different protocols, and many specimens of Neacomys are captured with bobbed tails. Nevertheless, the contrast in tail length is visually obvious when comparing series of skins of tenuipes with those of dubosti, guianae, and paracou. The tail is distinctly bicolored (dark above, pale below), at least near the base, in most specimens of tenuipes, but most specimens of dubosti and paracou have unicolored (all dark) tails. Unfortunately, the few available skins of guianae are too variable to characterize the species with confidence for this trait: whereas the type and two Surinamese specimens have tails that are distinctly bi-colored at the base, four other specimens have indistinctly bicolored or unicolored tails.",

Although we counted the number of scale rows per centimeter near the base of the tail on fluid specimens, only a few fluids were available for most species. Nevertheless, our data suggest that this character might be useful for field identifications: whereas nine adult fluid specimens of paracou from the type locality had 15-18 (mean \u03ed 16) scale rows/cm, the fluid holotype of dubosti had 21 rows/cm.

(Sigmodontomys) alfari (J. A. Allen). Current usage (summarized by Musser and Carleton, 1993) , however, recognizes Sigmodontomys and Nectomys as full genera, the former with two valid species (S. alfari and S. aphrastus) and the latter with three (N. palmipes, N. parvipes, and N. squamipes) . Only Nectomys (sensu stricto) is known to occur in Amazonia, Sigmodontomys being restricted to trans-Andean and Venezuelan coastal rainforests (Voss and Emmons, 1996: table 1).",

Thomas's account was based on a small series of specimens from Guyana and Surinam, but additional material identified as melanius was subsequently described by Hershkovitz (1944) and Husson (1978) . Whereas both Hershkovitz and Husson followed Thomas in treating melanius as a valid subspecies of N. squamipes (Brants, 1827) , Tate (1939) synonymized melanius with N. s. palmipes, a taxon that was originally described (as a full species) by Allen and Chapman (1893) from Trinidad. Petter (1979) subsequently de- scribed N. parvipes from French Guiana and compared it with sympatrically collected material that he identified as N. s. melanius. The identification of our voucher material therefore involves each of the three species of Nectomys regarded as valid by Musser and Carleton (1993) .",

We examined this specimen (MNHN 1979.345) and determined that none of its qualitative characters diverge from the (B, MNHN 1981 (B, MNHN .1296 ). In N. palmipes, the interparietal (ip) is deep (anteroposterior dimension) relative to its width (transverse dimension), and the exoccipital (exo) occupies most of the dorsolateral surface of the occiput. By contrast, the interparietal of N. melanius is relatively much wider than deep, and the dorsolateral exposure of the exoccipital is correspondingly reduced.",

French Guianan skins are not quite as dark, on average, as topotypical melanius from Guyana, but this appears to be the only point of external difference. Although measurements of Guyanese exemplars suggest that there may be a modest east-to-west increase in average molar size in this taxon (table 23) , our side-by-side comparisons of French Guianan and Guyanese specimens revealed no qualitative craniodental differences.

Based on the restricted type locality of squamipes (S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o, S\u00e3o Paulo state; see Hershkovitz, 1944) , this would appear to be the correct name for Bonvincino et al.'s southeastern Brazilian taxon. We agree with Patton et al. (2000) that aquaticus Lund (type locality: near Lagoa Santa, Minas Gerais) and olivaceus Hershkovitz (type locality: Therezopolis, Rio de Janeiro) are probable synonyms of N. squamipes, and that this species probably extends into northern Argentina. The observations of Peters (1861) and Hershkovitz (1944) Geographic, Morphological, and Karyotypic Comparisons among Three Species of Nectomys material suggest that the hindfeet of N. squamipes usually have six plantar tubercles, whereas the hindfeet of most specimens of N. melanius lack a distinct hypothenar (lateral tarsal) pad.",

Although we have not seen Pelzeln's problematic type, 14 the geographic proximity of Marabitanas to Venezuelan localities from which we have examined specimens referable to melanius tends to support this synonymy. Clearly, a comprehensive revision of Nectomys based on first-hand examination of relevant types and a critical analysis of morphological variation among the many hundreds of museum specimens now available for study will be essential for resolving this and other taxonomic enigmas. In the meantime, N. melanius is the oldest available name that we can confidently apply to the material at hand. OTHER SPECIMENS EXAMINED: Brazil-Par\u00e1, Cachoeira Porteira (USNM 546290, 546291).

Other distinctive attributes of the holotype were reported by Voss (1988) , who treated Daptomys as a junior synonym of Neusticomys.

The larger specimen (AMNH 267597; figs. 48, 49B, 49D) appears to be a young adult; its pelage is also dark, but the color is distinctly brownish and finely ticked with tawny-banded hairs, the testes are scrotal, the metapodial epiphyses are inconspicuous (but perhaps not completely absorbed), and the basicranial sutures are closed (although not completely fused). In fact, AMNH 267597 seems to be nearly the same age as the holotype and compares with it closely in external and cranial dimensions (table 25).

The type of N. oyapocki also appears to have an unusually narrow interorbital constriction by comparison with both of the other conspecific adults at hand, FIELD OBSERVATIONS: Both of our specimens of Neusticomys oyapocki from Paracou were taken in pitfall traplines in primary forest. The first example (AMNH 267597) was collected on 14 August 1993 about 5 m from a small (ca. 1.4 m wide), shallow (ca. 20 cm deep), clear, sandy-bottomed stream; the habitat at this site is perhaps best characterized as moist creekside forest on level sandy soil ( fig. 51 ). The second animal (MNHN 1995.992 ) was taken on 8 September 1993 at approximately the same distance from a slightly smaller stream, but on sloping, welldrained ground. The remains of small crabs ( fig. 52) found along other streams in our study area suggest that this species is not uncommon locally, but intensive trapping with Victors and Tomahawks set at streamside and baited with crabs produced no additional specimens.",

However, the hindfeet of Rhipidomys are distinctive, with darker metatarsal markings, larger plantar pads, and relatively longer fifth pedal digits ( fig. 53C ). In addition, whereas female Oecomys have eight mammae, female Rhipidomys have only six. More detailed comparisons between like-sized species of Oecomys and Rhipidomys that might be confused in the field are provided in the account that follows.

IDENTIFICATION: Oecomys auyantepui was originally described by Tate (1939) from two specimens collected at 1100 m elevation on Auyantepui in Estado Bol\u00edvar, Venezuela. Hitherto regarded as a junior synonym of O. concolor (by Hershkovitz, 1960) , O. trinitatis (by Cabrera, 1961) , or O. paricola (by Musser and Carleton, 1993) , auyantepui is unambiguously diagnosable from other named forms of Oecomys and merits recognition as a distinct species. Distinguishing traits include its predominantly gray-based ventral fur, a distinctly tufted tail, lack of broadly shelved supraorbital margins and postorbital processes, a primitive carotid arterial circulation, presence of an alisphenoid strut, a large postglenoid foramen, complete closure of the subsquamosal fenestra, and a distinctive range of morphometric variation (see table 27 and below). All of the specimens we refer to O. auyantepui are from the Guiana subregion of Amazonia ( fig. 54 ).",

Dorsal and ventral views of one of several pseudothelphusid crab carapaces found near small streams at Paracou. Patterns of breakage along the posterior and ventrolateral margins of this example match those observed on the carapaces of like-sized pseudothelphusids eaten by captive ichthyomyines (Voss et al., 1982: fig. 3 ). Such remains provided the first evidence that ichthyomyines were resident in our study area, an inference subsequently confirmed by trapped specimens of Neusticomys oyapocki. Both views about 2\u03eb. most of the specimens at hand, but the fur of the chin and throat is usually self-colored (all pale), and a few specimens have self-colored fur extending caudally along the ventral midline to the groin. The hindfeet are either covered uniformly with pale buffy hairs or the metatarsus is indistinctly darker than the toes, but a distinct metatarsal band of blackish fur is apparently never present. Undamaged tails are uniformly dark (almost blackish in some specimens) with a terminal tuft of hairs that are distinctly longer (6-10 mm) than the short (\u03fd2 mm) hairs on the proximal part of that organ.",

Additionally, other Guianan subregion species differ from auyantepui by having entirely self-colored (pure white) ventral fur (bicolor, rutilus), untufted tails (concolor, rex, roberti, trinitatis), more-or-less bicolored tails (trinitatis), broadly shelved supraorbital margins (rex), a derived pattern of carotid arterial supply (concolor), confluent accessory oval and buccinator-masticatory foramina (most bicolor specimens), and/or patent subsquamosal fenestrae (bicolor, concolor, rutilus, trinitatis). Instead, Oecomys auyantepui is morphologically most similar to O. paricola, a species that we do not recognize as occurring in the Guiana subregion. Oecomys paricola (Thomas, 1904) was originally described on the basis of a very young female specimen (BMNH 4.7.4.63) collected at ''Igarap\u00e9-Assu'' (\u03ed Igarap\u00e9 A\u00e7u at 1\u040a07\u0408S, 47\u040a37\u0408W; Paynter and Traylor, 1991) near Bel\u00e9m. To evaluate the hypothesis that O. paricola and O. auyantepui are synonyms (Musser and Carleton, 1993) , we examined the type of paricola and 21 additional specimens collected in the same interfluvial region (south of the Amazon and east of the Rio Tocantins). 15 Because it was not our intention to evaluate the taxonomic status 15 We examined specimens of Oecomys paricola from the following localities: Brazil-Par\u00e1, Belem (USNM 393819, 393842, 461386, 545232, 545233) , Capim (AMNH 188963, 203391, 203392, 203397; USNM 461385, 461388-461395, 461400) , Igarap\u00e9 A\u00e7u (BMNH 4.7.4.63, 4.7.4.64, 4.7.4 108) . of all museum material currently identified as O. paricola, we did not include specimens so determined from other interfluvial regions, some of which exhibit characters not shown by the type.",

By contrast, the hindfeet of Oecomys and Rhipidomys are proportionately broader; digits I and V are longer relative to II-IV; digit V is semi-opposable; the plantar epithelium is usually entirely unpigmented (pinkish in fresh material); the plantar pads are larger, softer, cushion-like structures; and the skin between the plantar pads is smooth or creased but never tuberculate.

Hershkovitz (p. 539) admitted that he had not seen Anthony's type of rutilus, but remarked that ''Judged by the original description, it is a subadult of the same Kartabo series identified by Anthony as nitedulus.'' Oecomys rutilus was listed as a valid species by Musser and Carleton (1993) , but no account of its diagnostic characteristics has yet been published to supplement Anthony's preliminary observations. To identify our Paracou material, we examined every available specimen of small Oecomys from the Guiana subregion of Amazonia, including the types of rutilus and nitedulus. In the fol- lowing account we provisionally accept the hypothesis that nitedulus and bicolor are conspecific (Hershkovitz, 1960; Musser and Carleton, 1993) , but we note that this synonymy remains untested by published analyses of character data, and that we have not made a careful study of typical bicolor (from eastern Ecuador). Instead, our taxonomic comparisons are based exclusively on Guianan material. 16 The frequency distribution of the length of the upper molar row (LM) for small Oecomys collected in the Guiana subregion of Amazonia (N \u03ed 66) is distinctly bimodal ( fig. 59) , with one peak in the interval 3.2-3.4 mm (including the type of rutilus with LM \u03ed 3.26 mm) and another in the interval 3.6-3.9 mm (including the type of nitedulus with LM \u03ed 3.79 mm). Although this univariate graph does not of itself show any morphometric discontinuity that could be used to sort specimens into discrete size classes (all frequency intervals between 3.0 and 4.0 mm are occupied), the bimodal pattern clearly indicates that our sample is heterogeneous. Fortunately, variation in other characters is correlated with molar toothrow length and provides unambiguous evidence for species diagnosis. In fact, the specimens we measured of the smaller species, O. rutilus, have molar toothrows shorter than 3.5 mm, whereas our measured specimens of O. bicolor have toothrows longer than 3.5 mm. With larger samples of both species, however, it seems inevitable that the observed ranges of variation in this dimension will eventually be found to overlap.",

In rutilus, the fur averages about 6- 8 mm middorsally near the rump, and it feels soft and lax when ruffled because the unresistant hairs return slowly to their normal (unruffled) condition. By contrast, the dorsal fur of bicolor is only 4-5 mm long in most specimens, and because bicolor is the larger species this absolute difference makes the pelage appear relatively much shorter. Also, the short fur of bicolor feels ''crisp'' to the touch because the stiffer hairs are more resistant to ruffling.",

Since the long hairs of the tail tuft are often exposed to bending and compression in museum trays, it is probable that some of the tufts we measured were broken short, so the mean tuft length determined from fresh specimens with undamaged tails might be larger for both species than the values reported here.

Carleton and Musser, 1989) has never been comprehensively revised, several publications have at least partially clarified the species-level systematics of Oligoryzomys in certain regions, notably Paraguay (Myers and Carleton, 1981) , Bolivia (Olds and Anderson, 1987) , and Central America (Carleton and Musser, 1995) . Unfortunately, the Oligoryzomys of northern South America have received no revisionary attention to date. In a preliminary review of the genus, however, Carleton and Musser (1989) hypothesized that a single widespread polytypic species-O. fulvescens-extends from Mexico throughout most of Central America, thence southward into Colombia and northern Ecuador and eastward throughout Venezuela, Guyana, and Surinam. Included as subjective synonyms in a subsequent synopsis of O. fulvescens (see Carleton and Musser, 1995) were costaricensis J. A. Allen, delicatus J. A. Allen and Chapman, navus Bangs, messorius Thomas, tenuipes J. A. Allen, munchiquensis J. A. Allen, lenis Goldman, mayensis Goldman, engraciae Osgood, and pacificus Hooper. As defined geographically by Carleton and Musser (1989) , O. fulvescens was not known to occur east of Surinam or south of the Amazon. Instead, populations of Oligoryzomys extending along the entire south bank of the Amazon from near the headwaters of that river to its mouth (near Bel\u00e9m) were identified as comprising a distinct species, O. microtis (J. A. Allen).",

Confusingly, the Paracou material is also morphometrically similar to typical Oligoryzomys microtis as represented by Allen's (1916a) original series (and several topotypes, table 32) collected by Leo E. Miller on the ''Lower Rio Solimoens (fifty miles above mouth)'', a locality that can now be restricted with some confidence to a specific site on the north bank of the river. 17 Apparent mensural differences between these very small samples (3 and 10 specimens, respectively) are unimpressive, especially when the considerable distance between collection localities (roughly 1300 km) is taken into account. Length of the molar toothrow is the only nonoverlapping measurement, but the mean sample difference (0.2 mm) is trivial. The few specimens at hand from immediately south of the Amazon (e.g., AMNH 95983, 188964) have toothrow measurements that do overlap those of our vouchers, so very large samples will probably be required to demonstate any significant divergence in this dimension between Oligoryzomys populations on opposite banks of the river, if any such difference in fact exists. Allen's (1916a) original description of Oligoryzomys microtis emphasized the diagnostic value of pale coloration, relatively small ears, and short tail for distinguishing this species from other congeners. In coloration, however, Allen's material of microtis appears to be indistinguihable from typical fulvescens with a [G]erman friend, and got some nice things in the mammal line . . . but I hope to go to another fazenda within a day or two.'' Miller therefore visited (or intended to visit) two localities near Manaus between 16 and 30 April. Perplexingly, Miller's skin tags give only ''Solimoens'' as the locality where he worked in this interval, and his field catalog (AMNH Mammalogy archives) contains no additional geographic information. Fortunately, this problem did not escape the notice of mammalogists who were still in time to obtain at least a partial first-hand clarification: in a letter dated 4 June 1945, G. H. H. Tate wrote Miller (then retired and living in Connecticut) asking him to provide additional geographic details about the types of Proechimys kermiti (collected 20 April 1914) and Oligoryzomys microtis (collected 29 April 1914) . Miller replied in a letter dated 6 June 1945 that ''After a short time in Manaos, I went down the Rio Negro and up the Solimoes about 50 or 60 miles to make the collections on the North bank of the river. The location is approximately between 3\u040a and 4\u040a S Lat., and Long. 61\u040a. I think this will locate the spot closely enough for your purposes.'' (italics ours; correspondence in AMNH Mammalogy archives). Because Miller did not mention collecting at separate localities on the 20th and the 29th, the second sojourn from Manaus mentioned in his letter to Chapman of 24 April 1914 may have been a return trip to his previously productive site. Based on Miller's reply to Tate, Moojen (1948) published the restricted type locality of P. kermiti as Manacapar\u00fa, a settlement located 70 km WSW of Manaus on the north bank of the lower Solim\u00f5es at 3\u040a08\u0408S, 60\u040a01\u0408W (Paynter and Traylor, 1991) . We assume that the type of O. microtis was collected at the same place.",

Miller (the collector of Allen's specimens) did not record, and our visual comparisons of dried ears between typical material of microtis and fulvescens revealed no obvious size contrast. The reputedly diagnostic short tail of microtis is also hard to assess. Although Miller's field measurements of the type (AMNH 37091) indicate that its tail was slightly shorter than the head-and-body, 18 three paratypes (AMNH 37088, 37089, 37097) have an average ratio of tail to head-and-body of 1.20. Because Miller did not indicate whether his measurements were of complete or bobbed tails (AMNH 37096 has an obviously bobbed-tail measurement of 20 mm with no accompanying notation to that effect), and because most of his skins no longer have intact tailtips (the result of bending and compression in museum trays), it is now impossible to evaluate the ratio of tail to head-and-body length in Allen's series. Other specimens of microtis (sensu Carleton and Musser, 1989) , however, are not very short-tailed: one specimen from the south bank of the lower Amazon (AMNH 203400) has a tail:body ratio of 1.17, whereas another (AMNH 188964) has an improbably large ratio of 1.57.

Although 18 Miller's original measurements, recorded in pencil on a small field label tied to the right hindfoot of the type skin, were correctly reported by Allen (1916a) as 183 mm (total length), 90 mm (tail), and 20 mm (hindfoot). However, Olds and Anderson (1987: 271 ) stated that ''. . . the tail of the holotype is more than half the total length, a discrepancy noted by Goodwin (1953) .'' In fact, Goodwin (p. 299) did not note any discrepancy and reported the same external measurements as Allen. an obvious implication of the preceding discussion is that fulvescens and microtis are conspecific, it is also possible that multivariate analyses of larger samples could detect morphological discontinuities that are not now apparent; karyological and biochemical comparisons among key geographic populations could likewise contribute to an assessment of these and other phenotypically similar nominal taxa of Oligoryzomys as valid species. Lacking the time to undertake such a critical revisionary study for this faunal report, we simply apply the older name to our Paracou material. FIELD OBSERVATIONS: All of our definite records of Oligoryzomys fulvescens at Paracou are based on collected specimens. All three of our vouchers were caught by hand at night in roadside secondary growth ( fig.  13) , where two were encountered running on the ground through sparse weeds and the third was climbing among the dried leaves of a felled tree.",

The dorsal fur is soft (not spiny) and varies in color (depending on species, age, and stage of molt) from rich reddish or tawny hues to drab brown. The ventral fur is superficially whitish or whitish gray, contrasting abruptly in color with the dorsal fur (ex-cept in juveniles), but the ventral hair bases are always dark gray. The mystacial vibrissae are short, not extending beyond the tips of the pinnae when laid back alongside the head. The dorsal surface of the hindfoot is unmarked by dark metatarsal spots or bands, and the naked plantar surface is pigmented (grayish in life and in fluid-preserved material, blackish on dried skins). The hindfoot ( fig. 53A ) appears narrow because the three central pedal digits (II, III, and IV) are much longer than the outer digits (I and V); the fifth digit is not semi-opposable (its claw not extending to the end of the first phalange of dIV). Tails are usually at least partially bicolored (at least near the base), average about as long as (never much shorter or longer than) the combined length of head-and-body, and appear quite naked (a sparse caudal pelage is visible only under magnification). Contrasting external characters of Oecomys species, which are sometimes misidentified as Oryzomys (and vice versa) by fieldworkers, are given in the introductory account for that genus (above).",

                "text": "Three species, Oryzomys macconnelli, O. megacephalus, and O. yunganus, occur sympatrically at Paracou as they probably do throughout the Guiana subregion of Amazonia (see range maps in Musser et al., 1998) . Whereas adult specimens of O. macconnelli are easily recognized by external characters, accurate field identifications of O. megacephalus and O. yunganus are more difficult. Juvenile Oryzomys, which lack the diagnostic external dimensions and coloration of adults, cannot be reliably identified in the field. Thomas VOUCHER MATERIAL: MNHN 1998 .674-1998 . Total \u03ed 3 specimens. IDENTIFICATION: Our three Paracou vouchers (collected by O. Henry, see below), together with additional material that we examined from other French Guianan localities, agree with Musser et al.'s (1998: 225-232) description of Oryzomys macconnelli, an identification that we confirmed by direct comparison with Thomas's (1910) type series from the Supenaam River, Guyana. Although the French Guianan material averages small-er than the type series in many dimensions (table 33) , most French Guianan specimens are young adults (with lightly worn molars) whereas the type series is composed of older specimens (with more advanced toothwear). In the absence of other noteworthy differences between the two series, most of the observed measurement divergence could be attributed to sample age composition. The longer molar rows of the Guyanese series, however, cannot be attributed to advanced age, and the observation of even longer toothrows in some Venezuelan series (LM averages 5.2 mm in 12 specimens that we measured from Estado Bol\u00edvar) suggests that a real east-to-west size gradient may exist among O. macconnelli populations from the Guiana subregion of Amazonia. Western Amazonian samples are even more divergent morphometrically (Musser et al., 1998: fig. 106 ), and available karyotypes from western Amazonia differ dramatically from those of the single population sampled for chromosomes in the Guianan subregion (op. cit.: fig.  105 ). In the event that western Amazonian populations currently referred to O. macconnelli merit formal taxonomic recognition, the name O. mureliae J. A. Allen, based on a specimen collected in eastern Colombia, is available (Musser et al., 1998: 278-280) . The Paracou population, however, is unambiguously assignable to O. macconnelli, or to the nominate race if a trinomial nomenclature is adopted.",

                "text": "IDENTIFICATION: At Paracou, and apparently throughout most of Amazonia, Oryzomys megacephalus (formerly O. capito, see below) occurs sympatrically with another morphologically similar species, O. yunganus (see range maps in Musser et al., 1998) . Both are drab-colored Oryzomys with brownish dorsal fur, whitish-gray ventral fur, and indistinctly bicolored or unicolored-dark tails that average a little shorter than heads-andbodies. Comparisons of external measurements from our voucher material suggest that French Guianan O. megacephalus have slightly longer tails than sympatric O. yunganus, but the difference in average values for the ratio LT/HBL is small (0.94 versus 0.89) and insufficient for field identification because of overlapping variation (the observed range in this ratio among our vouchers is 0.78-1.03 for megacephalus, 0.69-1.13 for yunganus). Our measurement data suggest no appreciable species difference in absolute or relative size of the hindfoot. On average, megacephalus has somewhat brighter adult dorsal pelage than yunganus, but the difference is subtle and not useful for field identification. The only external character potentially useful for distinguishing Oryzomys megacephalus from O. yunganus in the field is the number of plantar pads on the hindfoot (for illustrations, see Musser et al., 1998: fig. 17 ). Almost all specimens of megacephalus have six plantar pads: thenar, hypothenar, and four interdigitals. By contrast, most French Guianan yunganus have five pads because the hypothenar is absent (table 35). One Paracou specimen of megacephalus (AMNH 266527), however, lacks the hypothenar completely on one foot and has only an indistinct hypothenar on the other. Similarly, a few yunganus from Paracou (e.g., AMNH 266495, MNHN 1995.994) have distinct hypothenars on one or both hindfeet. Based on our tabulation of trait frequencies, a conser-vative approach to identifying these species in the field in French Guiana (classifying animals with six distinct plantar pads on both hindfeet as megacephalus and those with only five pads on both feet as yunganus) would leave an estimated 3% of specimens undetermined (i.e., those with asymmetrical numbers of pads, plus those with indistinct hypothenars on both feet) and would result in an expected error rate of about 5% (mostly yunganus misidentified as megacephalus).",

All of the Paracou vouchers we identify as megacephalus have (1) the long paraflexus and single fossette on M2, and (2) the long hypoflexid, diagonal median murid, and lack of fossetid on m2 described and illustrated by Musser et al. (1998) . By contrast, specimens we identify as yunganus have (1) a short paraflexus and two fossettes on M2, and (2) a short hypoflexid separated from a lingual fossetid by a less oblique median murid on m2 (op. cit.). Our multivariate statistical analyses of cranial measurement data from Paracou vouchers identified by these molar traits reveal that specimens of megacephalus have, on average, wider incisive foramina and narrower zygomatic plates than likesized examples of yunganus. However, measurement variation is too extensive for cranial proportions to be used as the sole basis for species identification at this locality. Although molar measurements differ significantly between sympatric samples of megacephalus and yunganus from some parts of Amazonia (Musser et al., 1998: table 8) , these species do not diverge in dental dimensions at Paracou.",

As understood by Musser et al. (1998) , Oryzomys megacephalus occurs throughout Amazonia and extends southward into the Paran\u00e1 basin of eastern Paraguay. Morphometric, karyotypic, and molecular data summarized by Musser and his colleagues, however, strongly suggest that western Amazonian populations (characterized by large size, diploid counts of 52 chromosomes, and distinctive mtDNA haplotypes) are genetically and evolutionarily distinct from Paraguayan and eastern Amazonian populations (characterized by small body size, diploid counts of 54 chromosomes, and different mtDNA sequences). Although Musser et al. (1998) recognized this dichotomy, they emphasized the difficulty of identifying geographically intermediate samples as belonging to either the eastern or western clades by morphological criteria and provisionally regarded all of their megacephalus-like Amazonian material as conspecific. Patton et al. (2000) subsequently recognized the western Amazonian form as a distinct species, O. perenensis J. A. Allen, a decision with which we concur.",

Of our 36 vouchers, 23 (64%) were taken in Sherman or Victor traps set on the ground, 7 (19%) were taken in Sherman or Victor traps tied to lianas 0.3-1.2 m above the ground, 5 (14%) were shot on the ground, and 1 (3%) was taken in a pitfall. Microhabitat notes accompanying 26 specimens shot or trapped on the ground record 18 captures under or beside logs, 4 captures under the roots or buttresses of fallen trees, 2 captures under tangled branches of fallen trees, 1 capture at the base of a buttressed tree, and 1 capture at the entrance to a hollow log. All of the shot specimens were encountered at night, and all of the other specimens were found in traps at or near dawn. Twenty-two specimens (61%) were taken in well-drained primary forest, 3 (8%) in swampy primary forest, 2 (6%) in creekside primary forest, 5 (14%) in primary forest of unspecified character, and 4 (11%) in secondary vegetation.

(1998) , who documented the extensive Amazonian distribution of this species by mapping all known collection localities (op. cit.: fig. 14) . As noted by Musser and his colleagues, the geographic samples they refered to O. yunganus exhibit considerable divergence in body size. Especially notable are specimens from Guyana, Surinam, French Guiana, and eastern Amazonian Brazil, which are diminutive by comparison with specimens from Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and western Brazil. For example, the observed range of variation in crown length of the upper molar series (LM) among our vouchers (4.3-4.6 mm; table 34) does not overlap with the observed range of variation among 52 specimens (including the type) that we measured from Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia (4.8-5.6 mm). Additionally, French Guianan samples of O. yunganus differ conspicuously from western Amazonian samples in the frequency of occurrence of the hypothenar pad on the hindfoot (Musser et al., 1998: table 7) . The currently accepted provisional hypothesis, that these and other differences among samples currently referred to O. yunganus represent intraspecific geographic variation, merits testing by additional collecting at intermediate localities (op. cit.: p. 109), and by analyzing molecular sequence data from Guianan and western Amazonian populations (as by Patton et al., 2000) .",

Microhabitat notes accompanying 15 specimens record 4 captures under or beside logs, 3 captures at the bases of trees, 3 captures in dense undergrowth unsheltered by woody objects, 2 captures under tangled dead branches, 2 captures under fallen palm fronds, and 1 capture among the stilt roots of a standing tree.",

Although we sometimes caught both species in the same trapline on the same date, statistical comparisons of capture frequencies by habitat (table 36) suggest that O. yunganus prefers moister primary forest habitats (swamp or creekside formations) than does O. megacephalus. The latter species was also trapped above ground level on lianas, and in secondary vegetation, situations in which O. yunganus was not encountered. Future ecological studies of Amazonian rodent communities should test the hypothesis that O. yunganus is a habitat specialist by comparison with O. megacephalus, but we caution that destructive sampling (or molecular typing, as by Lavergne et al., 1997; Steiner et al., 2000) will be necessary in order to obtain reliable taxonomic identifications for this purpose.

IDENTIFICATION: The ten nominal taxa of Rhipidomys based on type material collected in the Guiana subregion of Amazonia appear to represent four valid species that can be readily distinguished by external and craniodental characters. Rhipidomys macconnelli de Winton (1900) (including subnubis Tate, 1939) and R. wetzeli Gardner (1989) long, soft fur and a primitive carotid arterial circulation (pattern 1 of Voss, 1988) ; they occur in montane and premontane vegetation associated with rocky outcrops of the Pantepui complex (Tate, 1939; Handley, 1976; Gardner, 1989) and neither is known from French Guiana (where such habitats are absent). The other two species have shorter, coarser fur, a derived carotid arterial morphology (pattern 3 of Voss, 1988) , and occur in lowland rainforest. One of the lowland rainforest species (represented by the Guianan holotypes of sclateri Thomas [1887] , bovallii Thomas [1911b] , and aratayae Guillotin and Petter [1984] ) is large (HF \u03ed 32-36 mm; LM \u03ed 5.9-6.8 mm) with gray-based ventral fur, whereas the other (represented by the Guianan holotypes of nitela Thomas [1901] , fervidus Thomas [1904] , milleri Allen [1913b] , and yuruanus Allen [1913b] ) is small (HF \u03ed 24-28 mm, LM \u03ed 4.1-4.8 mm) with (usually) pure white ventral fur. Although the oldest Guianan name for the large lowland species is Rhipidomys sclateri, Musser and Carleton (1993) and Tribe (1996) treated sclateri as a subjective junior synonym of leucodactylus Tschudi (1844) , the type locality of which is in eastern Peru. Only a single specimen, the type of R. leucodactylus aratayae, is currently known from French Guiana.",

Based on our examination of types and other material, we agree with Musser and Carleton (1993) and with Tribe (1996) that nitela, mastacalis, and venezuelae represent three valid species with diagnostic morphological and karyotypic attributes, and with discrete geographic ranges (table 37).

For the most part, external and craniodental measurements of French Guianan specimens of Rhipidomys nitela agree closely with those of the Guyanese type series (table  38) . Although relative tail length appears to be divergent in the two samples (averaging about 130% of head-and-body length in French Guianan material versus 115% in the type series), methodological artifacts might explain this proportional difference between small series of specimens measured in the field by different collectors. By contrast, measurements of the hindfoot and of the molars (both measured by us) suggest that the populations in question do not differ much, if at all, in size. Because the French Guianan material additionally resembles the type series in qualitative characters, we interpret these samples as representing populations of a single species.",

One of these records, consisting of the type series of R. nitela tobagi Goodwin (1961) from Little Tobago Island, is equivocal in our judgment because the diagnostic presence of a conspicuous caudal tuft ( fig. 61B ) cannot be confirmed from the two partially decayed fluid specimens of this taxon; possibly, these represent an insular form of the adjacent mainland species R. venezuelae. The other nonAmazonian record of R. nitela mapped by Tribe (1996: fig. 7 .6) is improbably iso-lated on the northern Caribbean coast of Colombia. We examined the voucher in question (MHNG 1706.75, from Bonda, Departamento Magdalena), which differs from R. nitela by its pale bicolored tail and short (6 mm) caudal tuft; in our opinion, this specimen represents another taxon, perhaps allied to R. venezuelae despite its short (4.6 mm) toothrow.",

At Paracou, O. auyantepui and R. nitela are of similar size and might be confused in the field. However, R. nitela and O. auyantepui differ in many external characters that are potentially useful for identification of specimens in hand. (1) Whereas the pinnae of R. nitela are blackish (contrasting in color with the fur of the head) and appear quite naked (a very sparse auricular pelage is visible only under magnification), the pinnae of O. auyantepui are not contrastingly colored and have a visible pelage of reddishbrown hairs. 2The dorsal body pelage of R. nitela is very short (5-6 mm), somewhat coarse to the touch, and dull grayish-brown, but the dorsal fur of adult specimens of O. auyantepui is much longer (\u054610 mm), very soft to the touch, and lustrous reddish-brown in appearance. (3) The ventral pelage of R. nitela is almost entirely self-colored (pure white or cream to the roots of the hairs), except immediately along the flanks (where some hairs have gray bases and white tips); by contrast, the ventral fur of O. auyantepui is mostly gray-based, except on the throat and along the midline (where some hairs are pure white). 4The hindfeet of R. nitela are always prominently marked by a dark band of brownish hairs that extends from the ankle over all or part of the metatarsus to the base of the toes, which are usually white (pigmented hairs extend onto the proximal phalanges of the middle toes in a few specimens, but the outermost digits are always completely white); by contrast, pedal markings are not conspicuous in most specimens of O. auyantepui, some of which have uniformly pale feet. (5) Adult female specimens of Rhipidomys have six mammae in postaxial, abdominal, and inguinal pairs (muroid mammary loci are illustrated in Voss and Carleton, 1993: fig. 8 ), but female Oecomys have \u2190 because the mesopterygoid fossa does not extend anteriorly to the last molars; also, the posterolateral palatal pits of oryzomyines are large, sometimes complex, and frequently recessed in shallow fossae. Voss, 1993) , the palate is said to be ''short'' because the mesopterygoid fossa (mpf) extends anteriorly to or between the last molars; additionally, posterolateral palatal pits (ppp) are small or absent in ''thomasomyines''. By contrast, the palate of Oecomys and other oryzomyines is said to be ''long'' eight mammae (the additional teat-pair is pectoral).",

Nevertheless, skulls found in stomachs or scat can be easily identified by palatal architecture. The bony palate of Rhipidomys ( fig.  62A ) is ''short'' because it does not extend behind the molar rows, and the posterior palatal margin is biconcave because a small median palatal process is present; the posterior palatal pits are small, simple perforations.

Quills bicolored (yellowish basally with darkbrown tips), about 3 cm or less in length, densely covering dorsal surface of head, neck, trunk, and upper limbs, but only exposed on cheeks and crown of head (except where fur has come away in patches due to (Wagner) . Both views approximately \u03eb0.5. faulty preservation). Dorsal fur long and abundant, concealing quills from crown to rump; individual hairs pale basally (among the quills), but emergent fur black heavily streaked with pale yellow (a mass effect pro-duced by coarse guard hairs with very long yellow tips scattered abundantly among finer hairs that are entirely black or have only inconspicuous pale tips). Ventral surface of body without offensive quills, covered (Husson, 1978) ; 11, SURINAM, Suriname, Paramaribo (Husson, 1978) ; 12, VENEZUELA, Amazonas, Sierra Parima (Linares, 1998) ; 13, VENEZUELA, Bol\u00edvar, Imataca (Ochoa, 1995) ; 14, VENEZUELA, Delta Amacuro, Delta del Orinoco (Linares, 1998) . sparsely with short, coarse, brownish hairs (usually frosted with whitish bands or tips) from chin to anus. Face with very short quills on forehead and cheeks but otherwise almost naked, especially around eyes; facial vibrissae consisting of long, black mystacial, genal, and superciliary hairs; submental vibrissae short and black. Pinnae rudimentary and almost naked. Hands and feet covered dorsally with very coarse blackish hairs. Tail probably about as long as head-and-body on average; dorsum of proximal third with body pelage (quills and yellow-streaked black fur), but remainder of tail (except for naked prehensile surface) densely covered above and below with stiff black bristles.",

As in other caviomorphs, qualitative cranial and dental characters of erethizontids are annoyingly variable. Some differences among the specimens of Coendou melanurus that we examined may be corre-lated with age and sex, but with miniscule samples from widely scattered localities, interpretation is difficult.",

We have also examined several Ecuadorean specimens previously misidentified as C. melanurus and determined that they represent an undescribed species of the vestitus group; this taxon superficially resembles melanurus because it has long yellow-tipped bristles that contrast with the black-tipped quills to produce a similarly streaked pelage pattern. However, the new species is substantially smaller (HF, 58-59 mm; CIL, 58.8-64.4 mm; MTR, 14.1-15.2 mm), lacks a dense coat of long adult fur, and has more acutely angled mesopterygoid margins that penetrate more deeply between the toothrows (Voss and da Silva, submitted) .",

Unvouchered photographs of living Coendou melanurus (top) and C. prehensilis (bottom, not to same scale) from Petit Saut, French Guiana (ca. 28 km SSW Paracou). Both animals are alarmed, so the pale bases of their erected quills are exposed. When C. melanurus is not alarmed and defensive, its short bicolored (black-tipped) quills are hidden beneath a dense coat of long fur (see fig. 67 ). By contrast, the large tricolored (white-tipped) quills of C. prehensilis are always visible because the short sparse fur of this species is concealed among the quill bases. Also note the diagnostically bulging forehead and swollen muzzle of C. prehensilis, and the equally diagnostic blackish caudal bristles of C. melanurus. From color transparencies by J.-C. Vi\u00e9. (1961) and Ojasti (1972) recognized several subspecies of Dasyprocta aguti (\u03ed D. leporina; see above and Remarks, below) as valid, but the necessity for a trinomial classification remains to be convincingly established by a comprehensive study of geographic variation. From the close similarity between our voucher material and the Surinamese specimens with which we compared them, the Paracou population would be unambiguously referable to the nominate form if other subspecies were to be recognized in a future revisionary study. Alternatively, it is possible that red-rumped agoutis include two or more separate species (as suggested by Krumbiegel, 1941) , another hypothesis that remains to be effectively tested by critical analyses of specimen data.",

A single 19th-century RMNH specimen of D. fuliginosa is also said to have come from Surinam (op. cit.). None of this material, however, is accompanied by names of collectors, dates of collection, or any additional geographic information. Because we have not seen any material referable to D. cristata or D. fuliginosa accompanied by definite evidence of origin from any of the Guianas, we assume that these old and poorly documented Surinamese records are erroneous. As discussed by Goeldi and Hagmann (1904) , Thomas (1917) , and Cabrera (1961) , the type of D. prymnolopha, said to be from ''Guiana'' (Wagler, 1831: 619) , was probably collected somewhere along the Atlantic coast of Brazil between the mouth of the Rio Tocantins and Bahia. Apparently, D. leporina is the only agouti species validly known from Guyana, Surinam, French Guiana, and Guianan Brazil. The black agouti (Dasyprocta fuliginosa), however, occurs allopatrically in the headwaters of the Orinoco (geographically part of the Guiana subregion of Amazonia) in southernmost Amazonian Venezuela (Tate, 1939; Ojasti, 1972; Handley, 1976) .",

Because Linnaeus's (1766) original description of Mus aguti did not mention rump color, the identification of aguti has been justified primarily by reference to the bibliographic sources of his account (Marcgraf, 1648; Piso, 1658; Ray, 1693; Brisson, 1756) . Thomas (1898) argued that all of Linnaeus's sources for Mus aguti could be traced back to the Brazilian animal described by the Dutch explorer-naturalist Georg Marcgraf. According to Thomas, Marcgraf's agouti was a yellowrumped animal, but this inference is not consistent with what is known about the South American travels of that author.",

Instead, Marcgraf's agouti was almost certainly the black-rumped species of the northeastern Brazilian coast, a taxon currently known as D. prymnolopha (Wagler, 1831) . Marcgraf's (1648) brief color description and an accompanying woodcut of his ''Aguti vel Acuti Brasiliensibus'' are too ambiguous to support or refute this inference, but a painting by one of Marcgraf's contemporaries in Dutch Brazil (reproduced by Teixeira, 1995: vol. 5, p. 28) shows the local species as a more-or-less reddish animal with a blackish middorsal stripe over the rump, closely resembling D. prymnolopha of current usage.",

Whereas it is true that Piso's (1658: 102) and Ray's (1693: 226) accounts were obviously extracted from Marcgraf (1648), Brisson's (1756: 143) agouti description was based on an examined specimen (as previously noted by Tate, 1935) . Unfortunately, Brisson's description is taxonomically uninformative (like Marcgraf's), and the geographic origin of his specimen is not stated. However, Brisson was employed in the natural history cabinet of the French naturalist R\u00e9aumur (Taton, 1970) , so it is probable that all of the Neotropical specimens seen by him were from French Guiana. Additionally, Brisson (1756: 144) gave the geographic range of his agouti as ''Guiania & Brasilia'' and he cited Barr\u00e8re's (1741) description of the ''Agouty'' of Cayenne. After R\u00e9aumur's death, his collection was transferred to the Cabinet du Roi (Taton, 1970) , which subsequently became part of the Mus\u00e9um National d'Histoire Naturelle. Geoffroy (1803), however, recorded no MNHN agouti material from the ''ancien cabinet'', nor does that museum now contain any 18th-century specimen of Dasyprocta that might have been the one described by Brisson (L. Granjon, personal commun.) .",

It is therefore probable that Linnaeus himself either had seen specimens of Surinamese agoutis or had reliable reports of them from his many Dutch colleagues and aquaintances. Regrettably, no material of Dasyprocta that is certainly known to have been examined by Linnaeus has apparently been identified in the literature, nor have we succeeded in locating any nomenclaturally useful 18th-century specimens in museums known to contain Linnaean mammals.

Because Thomas's (1898) proposal to restrict aguti to Marcgraf's Brazilian animal was not equivalent to a lectotype designation, the application of the name aguti is still an open question. In our judgment, it would not be desirable to replace prymnolopha, the name by which the black-rumped agouti of the Brazilian Atlantic coast has been long and consistently known, with aguti, the traditional name for the redrumped species. We therefore select as the neotype for Mus aguti Linnaeus (1766) the same specimen (RMNH 20752) that Husson (1978) designated as the neotype of Mus leporinus Linnaeus (1758) .

We are aware of only two vouchered records of red acouchies outside the Guiana subregion of Amazonia: (1) one specimen (AMNH 37123) collected by Leo E. Miller on 21 April 1914 on the ''Lower Solim\u00f5es'', a locality that is now believed (see footnote 17) to correspond to Manacapar\u00fa, a settlement on the north bank of the upper Amazon just west of its confluence with the Rio Negro (locality 5 in fig. 73) fig. 73 ). Based on the latter record, we assume that unvouchered reports of unidentified Myoprocta from other sites along the south bank of the Amazon between the Madeira and the Tocantins (e.g., George et al., 1988; Voss and Emmons, 1996: appendix 8) were probably of red acouchies. Acouchies are apparently unknown east of the Rio Tocantins (Carvalho and Toccheton, 1969; Pine, 1973) . By contrast, green acouchies are extensively distributed in western Amazonia (west of the zoogeographic axis defined by the Rio Negro and the Rio Madeira), and they also occur in the headwaters of the Orinoco in southernmost Venezuela (Tate, 1939; Handley, 1976; Linares, 1998) . Although a few published sources imply that red and green acouchies occur sympatrically in eastern Ecuador (L\u00f6nnberg, 1925) or eastern Colombia (Emmons, 1990 (Emmons, , 1997 , our specimen data suggest that red and green acouchies are allopatrically distributed.

We examined all of these early works and determined that Buffon and Pennant contain nothing more than rephrased versions of des Marchais' and Barr\u00e8re's very brief reports about the ''Agouchi'' or ''Akouchy'' of Cayenne.

Cabrera (1961) agreed, noting that Erxleben's original sources were not professional naturalists and might have been describing the species inaccurately from memory. By contrast, Tate (1939) , Carvalho (1962) , and Husson (1978) applied the name acouchy to the green species based on Barr\u00e8re's color description; according to these authors, the red acouchy should be called M. exilis (Wagler, 1831) .",

Our single adult voucher was taken on the ground in a leghold trap in swampy primary forest, and a juvenile specimen was subsequently taken in a Victor trap tied to the base of a broad liana 50 cm above the ground in well-drained primary forest. Four unvouchered observations recorded in our fieldnotes document the presence of this species in well-drained primary forest, swampy primary forest, creekside primary forest, and secondary vegetation. Most of our sightings were diurnal, usually in the very early morning or late afternoon, but a few animals were flushed from their hiding places at night.",

We have examined five additional specimens (table 44) from the Guiana subregion, including our Paracou voucher, all of which essentially resemble Husson's material and appear to represent the same taxon despite substantial variation in some cranial dimensions (plausibly attributable to age differences) and in external proportions (perhaps attributable to measurement artifacts). Consistent with Husson's identification, these Guianan specimens have small toothrows (MTR \u03ed 5.9-6.6 mm) that fall within the range of variation exhibited by specimens referable to stimulax from southeastern Amazonia (right-hand column, table 44). By contrast with these smalltoothed Guiana and Southeastern subregion samples, all western Amazonian Mesomys samples have mean toothrow lengths greater than 7 mm (e.g., the series measured by Patton et al., 2000: tables 56, 58) . Small-toothed and large-toothed Mesomys are sympatric at Igarap\u00e9 Amorim on the left (west) bank of the Rio Tapajos (specimens in AMNH), but elsewhere these morphometric classes appear to be allopatric. Although it is geographically part of the Guiana subregion of Amazonia, the Venezuelan state of Amazonas is inhabited by large-toothed Mesomys (e.g., nine USNM specimens with a mean maxillary toothrow length of 7.2 mm), an observation consistent with the presence of other western Amazonian taxa (e.g., Dasyprocta fuliginosa, Myoprocta pratti; see above) in that area.",

That shipment apparently included the entire collection of natural history specimens assembled in Brazil between 1783 and 1792 by Ferreira, an employee of the Museu Royal d'Ajuda (Hershkovitz, 1987a) . Significantly, the primates illustrated in Ferreira's ''Viagem Filos\u00f3fica'' include two taxa (Chiropotes satanas chiropotes and Saguinus midas midas; op. cit.: table 2) that must have been collected or observed in the Guiana subregion of Amazonia, where the type of Mesomys hispidus might also have been taken. Hershkovitz, 1987a : fig. 3 ) was largely confined to Amazonian Brazil. Tate (1935) proposed restricting the type locality of hispidus to Borba, a settlement on the right bank of the lower Rio Madeira where Natterer collected the type of ecaudatus in 1830 (Pelzeln, 1883 ). Tate's action was biologically arbitrary but served to justify his synonymization of hispidus and ecaudatus, the types of which he had not seen. Unfortunately, two species of Mesomys with divergent toothrow measurements are known to occur in the interfluvial region between the Madeira and the Tapajos (e.g., at Igarap\u00e9 Amorim, see above) and it is not known whether the type of ecaudatus is a small-toothed animal (like hispidus) or not. Until the type of ecaudatus is examined and measured, the oldest available name based on a large-toothed Mesomys specimen is ferrugineus G\u00fcnther (1876) from northeastern Peru. Based simply on toothrow measurements, our Paracou voucher and other similar specimens from the Guiana subregion of Amazonia could justifiably be referred to Mesomys hispidus, of which stimulax is perhaps only a junior synonym. However, Patton et al. (2000) reported high cytochrome-b sequence divergence between small-toothed Mesomys specimens from opposite sides of the Amazon, a result that clearly indicates the insufficiency of toothrow length as a basis for taxonomic inference and brings into sharper focus the problem of exactly where the type of hispidus was collected (see footnote 22). For the moment, these are insoluble problems for which the only appropriate interim solution is to leave our voucher material unnamed.",

Husson also reported that his large species was more abundant, and had more rufous pelage, a relatively shorter tail, less appressed caudal hairs, and a wider mesopterygoid notch in the back of the hard palate than his small species (op. cit.: 429-438). Husson based his identification of the large species primarily on Geoffroy's (1803) description of pelage color in guyannensis because the skull of the type (not measured by Geoffroy) was thought to have been lost (Rode, 1945) . Husson's identification of the small species, however, was based on direct external and craniodental comparisons with the type of warreni.",

However, whereas Husson found that the large and small Surinamese species were nonoverlapping in maxillary toothrow length, Petter reported overlapping variation in this measurement, with observed ranges of 7.0-8.5 mm for guyannensis and 8.1-9.3 mm for cuvieri.

The presence or absence of a complete incisive septum and the development of an infraorbital groove are the two qualitative characters most consistently correlated with maxillary toothrow length: all large-toothed specimens (cuvieri) have a complete incisive septum and either lack an infraorbital groove entirely or have a very weakly defined groove; by contrast, most small-toothed specimens have an incomplete incisive septum and well-defined infraorbital grooves. Although most specimens of both tooth-size classes have a moderately deep mesopterygoid fossa and 2\u00bd folds on m2, no specimens of small-toothed rats in our sample have either a very shallow mesopterygoid fossa or m2s with 3 folds. It is noteworthy that the qualitative traits of the specimen with a maxillary toothrow length of 8.0 mm (MNHN 1981.48 , which could be interpreted as an outlier of either tooth-size class) link it unambiguously with guyannensis, and that specimens with ''atypical'' states for one qualitative character (e.g., AMNH 267047, a small-toothed animal that lacks any trace of an infraorbital groove) are not atypical in other qualitative respects. Altogether, these results strongly support the hypothesis that the discrete tooth-size classes associated with the names cuvieri and guyannensis represent valid species, a conclusion that is further bolstered by external, genitalic, and karyotypic comparisons.",

However, taxonomic assignments of juvenile and subadult Proechimys (with unmolted or incompletely molted soft, gray, immature pelage) are always problematic. Tooth impressions (Malcolm, 1992) and molecular markers (Steiner et al., 2000) are potentially useful tools for identifying young animals that should be incorporated in future field studies. Otherwise, many individuals will inevitably remain unidentified in ecological research based on nondestructive sampling, especially during the rainy season, when a considerable fraction of the population consists of young animals (Guillotin, 1982) .",

Although cuvieri is said to be relatively uniform in morphological characters throughout this enormous range, significant mtDNA sequence divergence (7-9%) exists among several geographic clusters of populations sampled by those authors (op. cit.). We have not attempted to evaluate geographic variation among Amazonian populations of cuvierilike spiny rats for this faunal report, but it is relevant to note that typical (French Guianan) cuvieri appears to differ significantly from western Amazonian material in some morphological traits. For example, whereas Patton et al. (2000) reported that the vomer (an element of the incisive septum) is exposed in most (25 out of 34) specimens from the Rio Juru\u00e1, this bone is not exposed in any of our 22 adult Paracou vouchers. If geographic patterns of variation in this and other morphological characters were found to be consistently correlated with mtDNA haplotype divergence, it would be reasonable to infer that two or more species could be represented among the samples currently referred to this species.",

Forty-four specimens (96%) were shot or trapped at ground level, but 2 specimens (4%) were taken in traps tied to lianas 0.7-1.0 m above the ground. Habitat data recorded for 45 specimens include 10 captures (22%) in well-drained primary forest, 3 captures (7%) in swampy primary forest, 10 captures (22%) in creekside primary forest, 2 captures (4%) in primary forest of unspecified character, and 20 captures (44%) in secondary vegetation. Microhabitat notes accompanying 28 specimens trapped at ground level record captures made under masses of fallen branches and other debris (8 specimens), under logs (5), in unsheltered sites in dense understory vegetation (5), beside logs (3), at the bases of trees (2), among stilt roots (1), on top of a log (1), inside a hollow log (1), on a smooth branch fallen over a stream (1), and under an overhanging stream bank (1).",

Apparently, all recently collected Proechimys from Venezuelan coastal rainforests (north of the Orinoco) are referable to other species groups (Aguilera and Corti, 1994; Aguilera et al., 1995; Corti and Aguilera, 1995) . Therefore, P. guyannensis appears to be an Amazonian endemic largely, but perhaps not exclusively, distributed in the Guiana subregion. 23 (1978) , who used the name P. guyannensis for the larger species identified as P. cuvieri in this report (see the preceding account).",

In effect, trap success (fig. 84 , indicated by the slope of the solid line in the upper graph) changed abruptly when, after about 2600 trap-nights in 1991, traplines previously deployed for general collecting in productive habitats (e.g., well-drained primary forest) were shifted to less productive sites (e.g., fig. 82 ).

Unfortunately, the duration of nightly hunts was not quantified in 1991 when this method was used most intensively. However, an estimate can be based on the fact that RSV and DPL both hunted every night on 58 consecutive dates in that year; assuming a typical hunt duration of 3.0 hours (the known average for hunts by the same personnel in 1992) yields a probable total effort of about 350 hours devoted to this method in 1991. Hunt durations were consistently recorded in subsequent field seasons: we devoted 96.7 hours to this method in 1992, 79.2 hours in 1993, and 64.4 hours in 1994 . In total, we systematically hunted at night on 123 dates from 1991 to 1994 at Paracou, for a total cumulative effort of about 590 hours.",

Indeed, whereas our deliberate hunting effort per field season declined from 1991 to 1994, our bat netting effort increased in almost direct proportion (all inventory personnel were usually engaged in one activ- ity or the other after dusk, seldom returning to camp before midnight), so the total time actually or potentially available to observe nonvolant nocturnal mammals per field date probably remained more-or-less constant throughout our inventory.

In fact, morphological and/or molecular data are already available to suggest that many widely distributed nonvolant ''species'' are composite (i.e., consist of two or more diagnosable geographic forms that should be recognized as valid taxa; see Remarks above for Caluromys philander, Marmosa murina, Metachirus nudicaudatus, Micoureus demerarae, Philander opossum, and Mazama gouazoubira).

Several unambiguously nonforest mammals might inhabit the coastal savannas and salt marshes just north of our study area (e.g., Odocoileus cariacou, Holochilus sciureus, Zygodontomys brevicauda), but none were encountered within our sampling radius.

As documented in the preceding analyses of sampling results, different inventory methods effectively sample different sets of species, and increased effort with any method generally produces more species. Therefore, even in the absence of real intersite diversity differences, long-term inventories (or those using more methods) would be expected to obtain larger species lists than short-term inventories (or those using fewer methods). Differences in the ecological scope of inventory fieldwork can also affect species richness comparisons because sites with greater habitat diversity will tend to be richer than sites with fewer habitats. Finally, large mammals are likely to be more abundant, and therefore more easily recorded, at undisturbed localities than at sites which have been partially defaunated by hunting. Published descriptions of inventory fieldwork (cited in the footnotes to table 55) document intersite differences in all of these potentially confounding factors: (1) Although fieldworkers at all sites used conventional trapping, diurnal hunting, and nocturnal hunting to sample nonvolant mammal diversity, other methods (pitfall trapping, arboreal trapping, and interviews) were less consistently applied, and no previous inventory has used all six methods in combination. 2Overall sampling effort is hard to quantify for nonvolant mammal surveys, but the duration of inventory work at each site (a monotonic correlate of effort) ranged from less than a year at some sites to many years at others. (3) Whereas most sites were located on rivers or lakes that provide habitat for semiaquatic, riparian, and forest-edge species, others were in well-drained uplands remote from large bodies of water. (4) Subsistence hunting probably eliminated some primates and other large species prior to inventory fieldwork at several sites, whereas other sites were pristine.",

Second, the long duration of inventory work at La Selva and Manu has probably been insufficient to fully compensate for the lack of methods suitable for detecting all of the small and elusive nonvolant species at those sites.

Although such regional and subregional diversity contrasts could have historical explanations, it is nevertheless appropriate to explore their consequences for the ecological structure of contemporary communities, which may suggest other causal factors.",

Indeed, there are many problems in attempting to do so. Whereas most rainforest bats can be sorted into guilds based on reasonably straightforward dietary and behavioral attributes (Bonaccorso, 1979; Kalko et al., 1996; Simmons and Voss, 1998) , many nonvolant mammals are harder to characterize ecologically. Numerous species feed on fruit when it is seasonally abundant, but switch to different resources when fruit is scarce; for example, woody browse (Mazama americana; Bodmer, 1990) , seeds (Dasyprocta leporina; Henry, 1999) , or animals (many didelphids; Atramentowicz, 1988) . The poorly documented or completely unknown food habits of some nonvolant taxa (e.g., Glironia, Sciurillus, many murids) is another obstacle to trophic classification.",

The striking deficit of arboreal frugivores at Paracou is partly, but not entirely, a consequence of the previously noted faunal differences in primate diversity. Thus, although the Manu fauna includes several frugivorous primate genera not found at Paracou, it also includes additional nonprimate arboreal frugivores (Caluromysiops, Bassaricyon), one of which (Bassaricyon) also occurs at La Selva. Furthermore, whereas western Amazonian tamarins (members of the Saguinus fuscicollis and S. mystax groups, both of which occur at Manu) appear to be primarily frugivorous (Peres, 1993a) , the single tamarin that occurs at Paracou, S. midas, is not (Pack et al., 1999) . Because only one arboreal frugivore (Cebus olivaceus) is among the species that might have been locally extirpated by hunting prior to our inventory (or that might yet be discovered by future fieldwork; appendix 1), it seems unlikely that this guild is grossly underrepresented at Paracou as a consequence of sampling inadequacy.",

The only commonly encountered species belonging to this guild (Caluromys philander, Potos flavus) were both nocturnal. In fact, our sighting rate for kinkajous at Paracou (3.08 per 10 hours of walked nocturnal census) is comparable to the highest rate reported by Glanz (1982: table 4) from Barro Colorado Island, and is higher than any figures that Emmons (1984: table 4) reported from four Amazonian localities. This result seems anomalous in the context of other indications that the Paracou environment is not rich in fruit resources, but it is possible that kinkajous are locally abundant as a consequence of ecological release following the virtual extirpation of competing diurnal species. Our sighting rate for Caluromys philander (0.17 per 10 hours), however, is low by comparison with most reported rates for congeneric species on Barro Colorado Island (C. derbianus; Glanz, 1982: table 4) and in western Amazonia (C. lanatus; Emmons, 1984: table 4) . It is noteworthy that trapping and sighting data for C. philander at Paracou are consistent with the results of other recent field studies (Charles- Dominique et al., 1981; Malcolm, 1991) in suggesting that this is one of the most exclusively arboreal of Amazonian marsupials.",

By contrast, our sighting rate for pacas (1.1 individuals per 10 hours of walked nocturnal census) is about equal to the average sighting rate (1.3 per 10 hours) for five Amazonian inventories tabulated by Emmons (1984: table 4) , and is similar to sighting rates from two of the three nocturnal census episodes recorded for Barro Colorado Island (Glanz, 1982: table 4) .

Inter-estingly, this is the only guild at Paracou where sympatry between congeneric forms is the rule rather than the exception: Neacomys, Oryzomys, and Proechimys are each represented by two or more species in the local fauna. Although most of the small nocturnal granivore/frugivores we recorded at Paracou occur syntopically in well-drained primary forest (the only exception is Oligoryzomys fulvescens, found exclusively in roadside secondary growth), our capture results suggest that some closely related species may differ in their use of other habitats. Thus, Oryzomys yunganus occurs more frequently than O. megacephalus in swampy and creekside forest, whereas Proechimys cuvieri occurs more frequently than P. guyannensis in secondary growth. To the best of our knowledge, ecological differences between O. megacephalus and O. yunganus have not been observed previously, but Malcolm's (1992) report of differential habitat use by P. cuvieri and P. guyannensis near Manaus agrees with our sampling results for these species. Neacomys paracou and N. dubosti occur syntopically at Paracou and are known from sympatric collections elsewhere in the Guiana subregion, but available information is too sparse to suggest how (or if) these congeners differ ecologically.",

Three terrestrial animalivores at Paracou are diurnal (Monodelphis, Speothos, Galictis), six are active both by day and at night (Myrmecophaga, Herpailurus, Leopardus pardalis, Panthera, Puma) , and the remaining eight are nocturnal (Marmosops parvidens, M. pinheiroi, Metachirus nudicaudatus, Dasypus kappleri, D. novemcinctus, Cabassous, Priodontes, Leopardus weidii) . All of the terrestrial-animalivorous carnivores at Paracou (felids, Speothos, and Galictis) were uncommon and most were only recorded by us through interviews. Monodelphis, Cabassous, Dasypus kappleri, Priodontes, and Myrmecophaga were likewise rarely collected, observed, or recorded from interviews. Only four local members of this guild were encountered often enough to provide noteworthy behavioral data or density estimates. Based on their highly carnassialized dentitions, small size, and the absence of macroscopic seeds in feces, we assume that species of Marmosops are predominantly, if not exclusively, animalivorous. Although species of this genus have opposable halluces and prehensile tails, our nocturnal observations and trapping results suggest that M. parvidens and M. pinheiroi are predominantly terrestrial, seldom ascending slender lianas or narrow stems more than a meter or two above the forest floor; none were taken in arboreal platform traps. Malcolm (1991) likewise trapped M. parvidens only on the ground, despite his intensive program of arboreal platform trapping. Woodman et al. (1995) captured M. noctivagus equally often on the ground and above ground, but none of their above-ground traps were set higher than 2 m. Patton et al. (2000: appendix A) listed several species of Marmosops as having been taken in ''canopy'' traps at some collecting localities along the Rio Juru\u00e1 in western Amazonia, but their text summaries of habitat data (op. cit.: 53-61) indicate that none were actually trapped at heights exceeding 2 m; instead, the majority (82%) of all captures of this genus on the Rio Juru\u00e1 were on the ground. Because many unambiguously terrestrial mammals (including Oryzomys, Myoprocta, and Proechimys in our study) will occasionally ascend lianas to reach baited traps, infrequent captures of Marmosops in low vegetation is not inconsistent with our provisional guild assignment for this genus.",

Instead, our capture results agree with observations from many other trapping programs (e.g., Miles et al., 1981; Malcolm, 1991; Patton et al., 2000) in suggesting that this is one of the most exclusively terrestrial of all New World marsupials. Similarly, our examination of stomach contents from 10 Paracou specimens is consistent with evidence from other dietary studies (Mathews, 1977; Santori et al., 1996; Freitas et al., 1997) that Metachirus is almost entirely insectivorous. Our nocturnal sighting rate for Metachirus (0.42 per 10 hours) is within the range of values reported for this taxon by Emmons (1984: table 4) at other Amazonian sites. SEMIAQUATIC/RIPARIAN FOLIVORES: This guild is not represented at Paracou, where suitable habitat for capybaras (Hydrochoerus) is absent. Semiaquatic-folivorous mammals never represent more than a tiny fraction of any Neotropical rainforest fauna. SEMIAQUATIC/RIPARIAN OMNIVORES: Only a single species assignable to this guild is present at Paracou and at Manu; no ecological equivalent is known from Central American rainforests. The Paracou species (Nectomys melanius) is apparently very uncommon and was not trapped by us. SEMIAQUATIC/RIPARIAN ANIMALIVORES: This guild comprises a smaller fraction of the fauna at Paracou than at either La Selva or Manu, where large bodies of water support resident otter populations. At Paracou, this guild is only represented by two species, both of which are nocturnal. Water opossums (Chironectes minimus) were sighted frequently in our study area (0.7 individuals per 10 hours of nocturnal census) and are obviously common in local streams, but we recorded no other significant natural history information about this species. Our pitfall captures of Neusticomys oyapocki are the first obtained by this method, which might usefully be applied to detect the presence of congeneric species at other Amazonian localities.",

Such topics bridge the separate research traditions exemplified by many previous studies of rainforest mammal faunas that have treated only bats or nonvolant species in substantive detail (e.g., Eisenberg and Thorington, 1973; Glanz, 1982; Brosset and Charles-Dominique, 1990; Janson and Emmons, 1990; Ascorra et al., 1993 Ascorra et al., , 1996 Medell\u00edn, 1993; Kalko et al., 1996; Peres, 1999; Patton et al., 2000) .

These differences are not large, however, and even the lowest estimate (based on the second-order bootstrap) suggests that the mammal fauna at Paracou is at least as well sampled as those at Central American field stations with decadeslong histories of biological research. For example, faunal sampling at La Selva is perhaps only 85% complete after more than 30 years of field research at that site, whereas faunal sampling near Barro Colorado Island is perhaps only 78% complete after more than 70 years (Voss and Emmons, 1996: table 10) . Bats constitute about 55% of the known Paracou mammal fauna, and our extrapolations suggest that similar proportions (54-56%) would have been obtained with additional sampling effort. In order of decreasing richness, rodents are clearly a distant second to bats, representing only 15% of the observed total species, followed by marsupials (8%), carnivores (7%), xenarthrans (6%), primates (4%), and ungulates (4%).

Wilson (1990) suggested that bats probably represent about 60% of the fauna at La Selva, a somewhat higher figure than is supported by observed species counts from that site, but approximately what could be expected there based on ecogeographic range data (Voss and Emmons, 1996: appendix 2) . Similar proportions will perhaps be found to characterize other Central American faunas, where most nonvolant clades (notably marsupials, primates, and rodents) are conspicuously less diverse than in Amazonia. By contrast, bats may constitute a smaller proportion of western Amazonian mammal faunas, where many nonvolant clades are maximally diverse. Bat communities have not been intensively sampled over multiple years at any western Amazonian site, however, with the result that existing species (Voss and Emmons, 1996: appendices 9-11) it seems likely that bats will eventually be found to comprise about 50% of the total mammal fauna at most western Amazonian localities. Although a few more mammalian species are currently known from Paracou than from any other Neotropical rainforest site for which published faunal lists are currently available (table 61, last column), this result is hard to interpret due to inventory differences in many of the confounding factors previously discussed in our comparative analyses of bat and nonvolant species richness. Among such factors, sampling methods and effort seem likely to be the most important: because we used many inventory methods over multiple field seasons at Paracou, our species list could be artifactually larger than those from more diverse sites where faunal sampling was substantially less complete.",

Linear regression suggests that faunal divergence averages about 14% per 1000 km for nonvolant mammals, almost twice the estimated rate of about 8% per 1000 km for bats. In addition, the residual variance in faunal similarity values-the variation ''unexplained'' by airline distance-is substantially greater for nonvolant mammals than it is for bats, with an F-ratio (computed from the meansquared-error estimates of the respective regressions) of about 2.8. The magnitude of the residual variation in nonvolant faunal similarity is aptly illustrated by comparisons between Paracou and two almost equidistant inventory sites. Although Imataca is slightly further from Paracou (1023 km) than is Xingu (994 km), percent nonvolant faunal similarity between Paracou and Imataca is 61%, whereas nonvolant faunal similarity between Paracou and Xingu is only 36%. Of course, faunal similarity values estimated from incomplete inventory data are subject to sampling error, which plausibly accounts for some differences between the Paracou and Xingu species lists (many ubiquitous carnivore taxa, for example, were not recorded by USNM fieldworkers during their short visit to the Xingu site; Voss and Emmons, 1996: appendix 8) . An additional factor of obvious importance, however, is the role of the lower Amazon as a barrier to nonvolant faunal exchange: at least 23 of the mismatches (species present in one fauna but not the other) between the Paracou and Xin-gu lists are taxa with eastern Amazonian ranges that are wholly or largely restricted to either the north side of the Amazon (e.g., Bradypus tridactylus, Saguinus midas, Alouatta seniculus, Ateles paniscus, Pithecia pithecia, Oecomys auyantepui, Oecomys rutilus, Coendou melanurus, Proechimys guyannensis) or to the south side (e.g., Bradypus variegatus, Saguinus niger, Alouatta belzebul, Aotus infulatus, Callicebus moloch, Oecomys paricola, Oryzomys emmonsae, Oxymycterus amazonicus, Proechimys goeldii, Proechimys oris). By contrast, bat faunal similarity does not differ dramatically between Paracou-Imataca (56%) on the one hand and Paracou-Xingu (49%) on the other, and only two bat species appear to have range limits defined by the lower Amazon (Tonatia schulzi and Lasiurus atratus, both known only from the north side). The same set of inventory comparisons therefore suggests that major rivers and other large-scale habitat discontinuities are less effective as dispersal barriers for bats than for nonvolant mammals.",

Parsimony analyses of endemism (PAE) were implemented with heuristic search algorithms in PAUP* (version 4.0b3a; Swofford, 2000) , which were applied separately to the presence/absence data for bats and nonvolant mammals; an all-zero operational geographic unit was added to both datasets to root the resulting networks. Relative support for different locality groupings was estimated by bootstrap resampling with 1000 replicates using 100 random-addition sequences per replicate. The geographic patterns recovered with \u054650% bootstrap support by PAE are a subset of those previously obtained from UPGMA clustering by Jaccard's coefficient for both datasets (figs. 96, 97) . It is also noteworthy that no PAE grouping that received more than 50% bootstrap support in one dataset conflicts with any PAE grouping with equivalent support in the other. Instead, a Central American/Amazonian faunal dichotomy is indicated for both bats and nonvolant mammals, as is a well-supported grouping of three adjacent inventory sites in southwestern Amazonia. However, PAE based on the nonvolant data supports additional intra-Amazonian faunal relationships that are not consistently recovered by PAE from the bat data.",

Such narrowly distributed taxa suggest the existence of subcenters of mammalian endemism, perhaps corresponding in location to several of the ''refugia'' that Prance (1982: fig. 11 .9) postulated to explain distributional phenomena in the Guianan rainforest flora. In particular, Prance's ''East Guianan'' endemics-rainforest plants with small ranges centered on French Guiana and Amap\u00e1 (e.g., Corythophora amapaensis; see Mori and Prance, 1987: fig. VI-1 )-may represent elements of the same narrowly endemic biota that we sampled at Paracou and share the same history of geographic isolation and/or local adaptation.

Obviously, a more complete ecological representation of the entire fauna could be obtained by cross-classifying species using the same criteria (e.g., to count diurnal-arboreal primary consumers, nocturnal-terrestrial secondary consumers, etc.) and by taking other physiologically significant traits NO. 263 BULLETIN AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY (such as body weight) into account. However, faunal analyses based on such comprehensive treatments are dauntingly complex (Skalli and Dubost, 1986; Dubost, 1987) and beyond the scope of this report. For many ecological researchers, the appropriate units of community analysis represent biomass (e.g., kg/km 2 ; Eisenberg and Thorington, 1973; Janson and Emmons, 1990; Peres, 1999) rather than species, but taxonomic diversity (not energy flow) is the subject of interest in the following discussion. The Paracou fauna does not appear to be unusual with respect to patterns of either diel activity or substrate use if allowance is made for the undersampling of bats in most Neotropical rainforest inventories on which previous conjectures about whole-community structure have been based (e.g., by Fleming, 1973; Bourli\u00e8re, 1989) . The Paracou fauna itself may be undersampled for arboreal species, however, which comprise a somewhat smaller proportion of the fauna at this site than at other Neotropical rainforest localities previously analyzed for substrate use (e.g., Kay and Madden, 1997: table 30.4) . Based on the list of additional nonvolant species that might yet be recorded in our study area (appendix 1), future inventory work could plausibly bring the numbers of arboreal and terrestrial species in the local community into closer conformance with ratios observed in other Neotropical faunas.",

Whereas most species of mammals in both New World and Old World tropical rainforests are said to be primary consumers (feeding primarily on fruits, seeds, nectar, leaves, or other plant tissues; Bourli\u00e8re, 1973 Bourli\u00e8re, , 1989 , species of secondary consumers (faunivores) outnumber primary consumers by a substantial margin at Paracou. Contingency tests suggest that this difference is highly significant for some pairwise comparisons with other well-known Amazonian faunas. At Manu, for example, the numbers of primary and secondary consumers are almost inversely proportional to those observed at Paracou (table 69), and it therefore seems appropriate to consider alternative hypotheses that might account for the preponderance of secondary consumers in our study.",

From initially high values early in our fieldwork, the proportion of the known fauna represented by primary consumers declined almost monotonically throughout the last half of our fieldwork to a final value of 39%. pling artifacts. Primary consumers constitute most of the mammalian biomass in all Neotropical rainforest communities studied to date (Eisenberg and Thorington, 1973; Janson and Emmons, 1990; Peres, 1999) , where frugivores and granivores in particular tend to be larger-bodied and/or to maintain higher population densities than most faunivores. In addition, some standard inventory methods are known to produce trophically biased samples of rainforest mammal communities; mistnets, for example, are primarily effective for capturing frugivorous bats (Fleming et al., 1972; LaVal and Fitch, 1977; Kalko et al., 1996; Simmons and Voss, 1998) , and conventional traps are most effective for capturing frugivorous-granivorous rodents (Voss and Emmons, 1996; this report) . For these reasons, short-term and/or methodologically limited inventories probably tend to overestimate the ratio of primary to secondary consumers in local faunas. Given the inverse correlation between known relative primary consumer diversity and cumulative sampling effort at Paracou ( fig. 99 ), trophic comparisons with less intensively worked sites are obviously problematic.",

However, at least part of the difference in trophic structure between the mammal communities at Manu and Paracou is not artifactual. Many taxa of primary consumers that occur at Manu are widespread in western Amazonia but have no known ecological equivalents at Paracou or in other core-Guianan faunas (e.g., Caluromysiops, Callithrix, Aotus, Callicebus, Lagothrix, Bassaricyon, Microsciurus, giant squirrels [Urosciurus] , Dinomys, Dactylomys, Sylvilagus) , and several taxa of primary consumers common to both inventories are consistently more speciose at western Amazonian than at Guianan localities (e.g., Carollia, Platyrrhin-us, Uroderma, Saguinus, Proechimys) . By contrast, no taxon of primary consumers in the Guianan fauna seems to lack an ecological equivalent in western Amazonia, and no taxon of primary consumers common to both faunas is known to be consistently more speciose at Guianan than at western Amazonian localities. Because secondary consumers appear to be about equally diverse in both Amazonian subregions, at least part of the observed trophic divergence between the Paracou and Manu communities seems to reflect a biogeographic gradient that principally affects the species richness of primary consumers. 32",

Our statement about the absence of Guianan primary consumers lacking ecological equivalents in western Amazonia acknowledges the dietary similarity between Chiropotes and Cacajao (following Ayres, 1989) , and our assessment of secondary consumer diversity as approximately equal in Guianan and western Amazonian habitats is based on the fact that several faunivorous bat taxa (e.g., emballonurids, phyllostomines, molossids) have yet to be adequately sampled at any western Amazonian site. Voss and Emmons (1996: table 13) listed Caluromys (a marsupial primary consumer) as maximally speciose in the Guianan subregion, but most core-Guianan faunas have only C. philander. cal lowlands can hardly be overemphasized. Estimates of both local richness and faunal complementarity (endemism) rely crucially on the ability of investigators to distinguish taxa, an ability that is compromised by our currently inadequate knowledge of species limits in many Neotropical clades. Just how much remains to be learned is suggested by the taxonomic results of this study, wherein we applied the most basic of all species criteria (morphological diagnosability) to assign names to voucher material collected at Paracou.",

Of course, we were not the first to recognize many of these species as valid. Most of the resurrected taxa in this list were originally named as full species and were long recognized as such until synonymized (often with little or no explicit justification) by uncritical advocates of the ''polytypic'' species concept. More recently, Handley (1976) , Brosset and Charles-Dominique (1990) , and other cited authors anticipated some of our taxonomic conclusions. However, none of these species were recognized as valid by Wilson and Reeder (1993) , whose checklist serves as an adequate summary of the prevailing taxonomic consensus at the time we began our inventory work. By contrast, our results suggest that only two species that Wilson and Reeder recognized as valid should be synonymized: Choeroniscus intermedius (with C. minor), and Nectomys parvipes (with N. melanius).",

Based on our preliminary assessment of many extralimital alpha-taxonomic problems, we anticipate that future research will provide strong mammalian support for many of the endemic patterns first remarked and clearly delimited for Amazonian birds by Cracraft (1985) . Many of the molecular results summarized by Patton et al.

Although it is crucial to draw the distinction between haplotypes and taxa in these mitochondrial-gene studies, the prima facie implication of such incongruence is that not all Guianan taxa share the same biogeographic history.

Poor soils have been hypothesized to negatively affect the species richness of rainforest mammals by constraining plant productivity (Emmons, 1984; Gentry and Emmons, 1987) , and it seems intuitively obvious that plant productivity should more directly impact primary consumer than faunivore diversity. Geology therefore offers a superficially plausible explanation for two of the most distinctive contrasts between Guianan and western Amazonian mammal faunas.",

Nor do the climatic maps that we have examined suggest any sharp change in the amount or seasonality of annual rainfall that coincides with the hypothesized limits of the Guianan center of endemism. Although multifactorial models of plant productivity might reveal some ecologically significant combination of edaphic and climatic variables that broadly characterizes Guianan versus other Amazonian landscapes, it does not seem plausible that ecological gradients alone could result in sharply defined areas of endemism in the absence of historical barriers to dispersal. Given that gradients exist, however, and that taxa differ in their ecological requirements, it would be interesting to explore the possibility (with computer simulations) that semipermeable dispersal barriers might attract species boundaries over many generations in much the same way that they appear to attract step clines in gene frequencies (Endler, 1977) . Alternative scenarios for the historical assembly of Amazonian biotas have tended to view major rivers as effective dispersal barriers (e.g., Wallace, 1852; Cracraft, 1985; Ayres and Clutton-Brock, 1992) , or as mere hydrological boundaries between ecologically distinctive terrains (Tuomisto and Ruokolainen, 1997) . The nature of faunal transitions between mammalian centers of endemism, however, suggests that a more interactive conception of biotic assembly might better fit the facts at hand.",

Cerdocyon thous: This savanna-dwelling canid (Langguth, 1974) is known from several Surinamese localities (Husson, 1978) but has not been reported from French Guiana.7. Leopardus tigrinus: The original description of this species was based on an 18th-century specimen said to be from Cayenne (Allen, 1919; Husson, 1978 ), but we are not aware of any recently collected material from French Guiana. A single unvouchered sighting from Les Nouragues (P. Charles-Dominique, personal commun.) appears to be the only known modern French Guianan record, but Husson (1978) described several specimens from Surinam. Oncillas occur in a wide range of habitats, including lowland rainforest (Emmons, 1990 (Emmons, , 1997 .8. Lontra longicaudis: This rainforest species (Emmons, 1990 (Emmons, , 1997 is probably widely distributed in both French Guiana (MNHN specimens are from ''Crique Saunier'', ''Rivi\u00e8re Kaw'', ''Rivi\u00e8re Oyapock'', and Trois Sauts) and Surinam (Husson, 1978) . Lontra longicaudis has been sighted near Paracou (in a deep tributary stream of the lower Sinnamary River and in mangroves along Crique Malmanoury; P. Petronelli, personal commun.), but never within the 3-km sampling radius around our camp, where streams are probably too shallow and/or intermittent to support otters.9. Pteronura brasiliensis: The type locality of this semiaquatic rainforest species was restricted to French Guiana based on 18th-century observations (see Husson, 1978) , but few specimens are apparently known from the department. Two old live-mounts in the MNHN are from ''Cayenne'' (L. Granjon, personal commun.), and there is a single skin in the same museum from the vicinity of Kaw (MNHN 1990 .647, previously misidentified as Lutra longicaudis; F. Catzeflis, personal commun.). However, recent sightings have been reported from Les Nouragues, Kaw, Crique Malmanoury, and Crique Ang\u00e9lique (F. Catzeflis and P. Charles-Dominique, personal commun.). Giant otters are still common and widespread in Surinam (Husson, 1978; Duplaix, 1980; Carter and Rosas, 1997) .10. Procyon cancrivorus: The crab-eating raccoon was originally described from French Guiana by Cuvier (1798) , and two old mounted specimens from ''Cayenne'' are in the MNHN (L. Granjon, personal commun.). Recent records of French Guianan raccoons are from Petit Saut and Kourou (F. Catzeflis, personal commun.). Husson (1978) summarized Surinamese records of this species. Field observations from the Guianas suggest that P. cancrivorus is restricted to mangrove swamps, tidal marshes, and riverbank habitats (Beebe, 1925; Sanderson, 1949; Husson, 1978) .11. Odocoileus cariacou: The type locality of the Guianan white-tailed deer (a distinct species from O. virginianus; see Molina and Molinari, 1999) was restricted to ''Guyane, coastal French Guiana'' by Hershkovitz (1948b: 44) and further restricted to Cayenne by \u00c1 vila-Pires (1958) . There appear to be no other published records of this deer from French Guiana accompanied by definite locality information, but two mounted specimens in the MNHN are from ''Guyane'' (L. Granjon, personal commun.). Surinamese records were discussed by Husson (1978) , who summarized published and unpublished accounts suggesting that Guianan white-tailed deer are primarily associated with savannas and other open habitats.12. Holochilus sciureus: Marsh rats of the genus Holochilus were apparently first reported from French Guiana by Charles-Dominique (1993) , who identified them as H. brasiliensis. Guianan marsh rats, however, more closely resemble H. sciureus in the craniodental characters discussed and illustrated by Voss and Carleton (1993) . Apparently, the only known French Guianan specimens (in the MNHN) are from the \u00cele de Cayenne. Surinamese collection localities for Holochilus were reported by Husson (1978) and Genoways et al. (1981) . Like other congeneric species, H. sciureus exclusively inhabits open habitats, notably wet grass-and sedge-dominated communities, including marshes, rice fields, wet meadows, and sugarcane plantations (e.g., Twigg, 1962 Twigg, , 1965 Husson, 1978; Genoways et al., 1981) .13. Neacomys guianae: Although frequently reported from French Guiana (e.g., by Guillotin, 1982; Charles-Dominique, 1993; Voss and Emmons, 1996: appendix 5) , all of the specimens of French Guianan Neacomys that we examined represent other species (see the accounts for N. dubosti and N. paracou, above). Apparently, the range of true Neacomys guianae extends from Venezuela eastward through Guyana to Surinam (see table 19, footnote b) and does not include French Guiana at all. Although nothing definite has been recorded in the literature concerning the habitats where specimens that we can certainly identify as N. guianae were collected, other congeneric species all occur in lowland or lower montane rainforests.14. Oecomys bicolor: French Guianan specimens in the MNHN document the occurrence of this species at Arataye, Cacao, Sa\u00fcl, Trois-Sauts, and ''Rivi\u00e8re Approuague''. Husson (1978) recorded numerous specimens that he identified as",

In all specimens of N. oyapocki, the hypocone/metacone lobe of M2 is greatly reduced by comparison with that of N. venezuelae, and there is no trace of a posteroloph.
