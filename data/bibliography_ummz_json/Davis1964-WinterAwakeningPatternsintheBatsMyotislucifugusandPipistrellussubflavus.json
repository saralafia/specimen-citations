On 9 February 1963,20 each of Myotis lUcifugus and Pipistrellus subflavus were located In Bat Cave, Carter Co., Ky., by marking with soot the spot on the cave wall where each bat was found. This was done in a quiet side passage, 650 feet from the entrance, where only singletons of the two species were found. Each location was checked for its occupant once a week through 10 May 1963, except that 2 weeks were missed. Faults with this procedure are evident: a bat may awaken and not move from his location, or he might return to the same identical spot. Also there is the possibility that another bat of the same species might come to occupy the identical spot.",

BREEDING RECORDS AND NOTES ON PHENACOMYS SILVICOLA IN OREGON While conducting microtine research at Oregon State University during the summer of 1963, the author located a colony of the dusky tree mouse, Phenacamys silvicola, 8 miles north of Corvallis in the McDonald State Forest. The only previous record of this rare tree mouse in the Corvallis area was by Wight 0. Mamm., 6: 282-283, 1925) , who took an adult female from a tree on Mary's Peak, 15 miles to the west. On 12 May 1963 the author checked 2 nests which were located 30 feet above the ground in the tops of secondgrowth Douglas fir trees. Out of one nest an adult male Phenacamys silvicola was collected, and from the second nest four juvenile males were taken. All the juveniles had a dull brown pelage as compared to the bright cinnamon of the adult tree mouse. The nestlings were about ready to leave the nest since they were quite able to fend for themselves in captivity.The nests of these dusky tree mice were very similar to those described by Howell (N. Am. Fauna, 48: 39-64, 1926) for Phenacomys longicaudus. The nests were bulbous masses of small fir boughs and needles, moss, droppings and the midribs of fir needles, which reached 1-1:Jh feet in diameter. The nests were located against the tree trunks and had 2-3 tunnels to the outside which exited in various locations ranging from the very top to the bottom of the nest mass. The nest from which the adult male was taken had 2 chambers; one was a sleeping chamber lined with midribs of fir needles, and the second chamber was for defecation and contained a large number of droppings. On 15 May 1963, after checking several empty Phenacamys nests in the same general area, an adult female dusky tree mouse was removed from a nest about * mile south of the first area. The nest also contained 2 naked young which were judged to have been born within the previous 24-hour period due to their size and undeveloped condition. One weighed 2.56 g and the other 2.60 g.",
