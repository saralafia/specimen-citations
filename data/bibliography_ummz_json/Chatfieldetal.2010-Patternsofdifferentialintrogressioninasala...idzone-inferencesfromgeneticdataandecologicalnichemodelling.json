    "abstract": "Hybrid zones have yielded considerable insight into many evolutionary processes, including speciation and the maintenance of species boundaries. Presented here are analyses from a hybrid zone that occurs among three salamanders-Plethodon jordani, Plethodon metcalfi and Plethodon teyahalee-from the southern Appalachian Mountains. Using a novel statistical approach for analysis of non-clinal, multispecies hybrid zones, we examined spatial patterns of variation at four markers: single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in the mtDNA ND2 gene and the nuclear DNA ILF3 gene, and the morphological markers of red cheek pigmentation and white flecks. Concordance of the ILF3 marker and both morphological markers across four transects is observed. In three of the four transects, however, the pattern of mtDNA is discordant from all other markers, with a higher representation of P. metcalfi mtDNA in the northern and lower elevation localities than is expected given the ILF3 marker and morphology. To explore whether climate plays a role in the position of the hybrid zone, we created ecological niche models for P. jordani and P. metcalfi. Modelling results suggest that hybrid zone position is not determined by steep gradients in climatic suitability for either species. Instead, the hybrid zone lies in a climatically homogenous region that is broadly suitable for both P. jordani and P. metcalfi. We discuss various selective (natural selection associated with climate) and behavioural processes (sex-biased dispersal, asymmetric reproductive isolation) that might explain the discordance in the extent to which mtDNA and nuclear DNA and colour-pattern traits have moved across this hybrid zone.",

One important aspect of hybrid zone studies is that different markers, either molecular or morphological, may exhibit different patterns in frequency change across a hybrid zone. These differences may indicate important ecological and evolutionary dynamics in the gene or gene regions under study (Teeter et al. 2008 (Teeter et al. , 2010 or between the interacting species (e.g. Arntzen & Wallis 1991; Brito 2007) .",

                "text": "A pattern of differential introgression may indicate hybrid zone movement. Recent empirical work suggests that hybrid zone movement may be more common than once thought (Buggs 2007) . This has led to inferences on the ecological and evolutionary dynamics among participating species (e.g. Arntzen & Wallis 1991; Hairston et al. 1992; Rohwer et al. 2001; Garc\u00eda-Par\u00eds et al. 2003) . In a recent review, Buggs (2007) identified 23 studies which documented hybrid zone movement and another 16 studies which had patterns consistent with movement. These studies utilize two different approaches: first, long-term monitoring of molecular and morphological markers across a hybrid zone is a reliable method for detecting movement. Second, analysing differential patterns of introgression across a suite of markers at a single point in time may allow inference of movement. One cause of hybrid zone movement is range expansion or contraction as a result of climate change. Although evidence for this phenomenon is limited (but see Britch et al. 2001 and Walls 2009) , there is widespread evidence that species' ranges have shifted in response to Pleistocene cooling and warming (e.g. Davis & Shaw 2001; Peterson et al. 2004; Brito 2007) . Furthermore, shifts in hybrid zone position resulting from climate change are expected to be greatest for montane species, as geographically proximate locations may experience considerable climatic differences (Hewitt 1996; Guralnick 2007 ; but see Peterson 2003) .",

The hybrid zone occurs at the boundary between the Great Smoky and Balsam Mountains in the southern Appalachians of North Carolina and Tennessee. The high elevation species P. jordani and P. metcalfi are known to hybridize along two ridgelines, Balsam Mountain and Hyatt Ridge (Hairston 1950; Highton 1970; Hairston et al. 1992) . These ridgelines are high elevation corridors that connect the Great Smoky to the Balsam Mountains, encompassing the range of P. jordani and a portion of the range of P. metcalfi, respectively. A third species, P. teyahalee, inhabits lower elevations throughout much of the southern Appalachians and hybridizes with the former species at intermediate elevations (Peabody 1978; Manzo 1988; Reagan 1992 ). The most complete study of this system was conducted by Hairston et al. (1992) . These authors sampled salamanders from the same five localities along the southern portion of Balsam Mountain each year for an 18-year period and recorded the amount of red cheek pigmentation, which is present in P. jordani but absent in P. metcalfi. That study documented extensive hybridization along the ridgeline, and because no movement was detected, yielded some insight into the short-term stability of the hybrid zone.",

It is only recently that the GIS-based method of ecological niche modelling (ENM) has been used in hybrid zone studies (Cicero 2004; Swenson 2006 Swenson , 2008 Mart\u00ednez-Freir\u00eda et al. 2008; Swenson et al. 2008) , although earlier studies have incorporated habitat-genotype associations (Bridle et al. 2001) . Moreover, as the width of this hybrid zone is narrow, the fine scale at which ENM is utilized in this study represents a novel application to the study of hybrid zones and highlights the utility of ENM, in concert with genetic and morphological data, for understanding hybrid zone dynamics.",

Instead, two different types of analyses were performed to explore differential patterns of introgression. The first consisted of two chi-square contingency table tests on the entire data set that were used specifically to test for differential introgression of mtDNA relative to the ILF3 marker. The first test was performed on individual samples and tested the null hypothesis of no difference in relative abundance of P. jordani, P. metcalfi and P. teyahalee genotypes between the two markers. The second test compared sample localities that were classified by their most common genotype at the nuclear and mtDNA markers and tested the null hypothesis that the number of sites dominated by each species' genotype was the same for the two markers. In both tests, significance was assigned at the P \u00a3 0.05 level. Second, we used generalized log-linear models (GLMs) to fit specific genetic models to the genotypic contingency table for the entire data set (Table 1) . Genotypes were grouped according to whether they were (i) 'parental' (homozygous at the nuclear marker and had homospecific mtDNA), (ii) 'homozygous hybrid' (homozygous at the nuclear marker and had heterospecific mtDNA), (iii) '2-way heterozygote' (heterozygous at the nuclear marker and had mtDNA from one of the nuclear parents) or (iv) '3-way heterozygote' (heterozygous at the nuclear marker and had mtDNA from a third parental species). Although these designations apply only to the two genetic markers assayed ('parentals' might be genetically mixed at other parts of the genome), they allow us to specify a symmetrical model in which the genotypic contingency table is predicted only by the marginal genotype frequencies and these four hybrid categories. In addition to this symmetrical model and the null model (in which each possible 2-locus genotype is predicted only by the frequencies of the single-locus genotypes), we tested nine asymmetrical models constructed by including interaction terms between single-locus genotypes and the generic hybrid categories. These asymmetrical models incorporate variation within hybrid categories according to the specific ancestry of genotypes. These analyses test for patterns of association (linkage disequilibrium) between mtDNA and ILF3 genotypes that might be caused by spatial structure, mating behaviour and \u2044 or selection. Given the spatial structure of sampling, we expected to reject the statistical null model therefore what is most interesting is the biological interpretation of symmetrical versus asymmetrical models. Models were fitted using Poisson GLMs in the stats package of R 2.6.2 (http://www.r-project.org).",

AIC can be used to decide on the best of a given set of models, or as a multimodel inference tool that assesses the suitability of the full set of models given the data (Burnham & Anderson 2004) . Models are ranked according to their AIC values, with lower values indicating higher suitability. Often, as is done here, AIC values are given as DAIC, which is the difference of each AIC value from that of the best model. The second method uses the residual deviance as a measure of the goodness-of-fit of a model relative to a saturated model, which acts as a baseline (Agresti 2007) . Higher values indicate more variation is unaccounted for by the model and, therefore, lower values indicate models with a better fit. Significance levels are determined by comparison of each model to the saturated model. Therefore, an insignificant residual deviance (P > 0.05) means the saturated model does not fit significantly better than the tested model, which we would infer is an adequate description of the data because the residual variance is adequately explained as sampling error.",

As such, environmental factors (e.g. climate) might play an important role in maintaining the spatial locations of hybrid zones. For example, many hybrid zones are associated with ecotones where lineages that are adapted to different climatic conditions come into geographic contact and interbreed (e.g. Cicero 2004; Swenson 2006) . Alternatively, hybrid zones are also common in environmentally homogeneous regions where previously isolated lineages that share similar climatic requirements come into geographic contact. The latter type of hybrid zone may be maintained primarily by dispersal of parental forms and endogenous selection against hybrids (Barton & Hewitt 1985) , or they may correspond to locations where previously isolated lineages are in the process of merging (e.g. Pereira & Wake 2009) . To explore whether climatic factors might influence the structure of the hybrid zone, we used ecological niche modelling (ENM) to predict the geographic distribution of climatically suitable habitats for P. jordani and P. metcalfi, and the extent to which such locations geographically overlap. We used Maxent version 3.2 to model the potential geographic distributions of P. jordani and P. metcalfi. Briefly, Maxent predicts the expected distribution of a species using data on the environmental conditions where it is known to occur and randomly selected background locations in the study area. Maxent is a general approach for characterizing probability distributions from incomplete information and computes a probability distribution that describes the relative suitability of each grid cell as a function of the environmental variables at all the known occurrence locations (Phillips et al. 2006) . When the model is projected into geographic space, it produces a map of the species' potential geographic distribution.",

Models for P. teyahalee are not included as the model resolution is not fine enough to permit meaningful interpretation in the narrow area of hybridization between this species and P. jordani and P. metcalfi. Most of the records used in the analysis were collected by R. Highton and assigned to species using morphology and allozymes. Locality records occurring within the same map pixel were removed to avoid pseudoreplication. To calibrate the model, we used quadratic features, and default parameters for the number of background pixels, regu-larization, the convergence threshold and the maximum number of iterations (following Phillips et al. 2006) . We randomly selected 75% of the occurrence locations to construct the model; the remaining 25% were set aside to test the model.

We then classified as climatically unsuitable, any grid cell falling in the lower 5th percentile of this empirical distribution of suitability scores. Finally, given this threshold for suitability, we used the grid overlay function in DIVA GIS 5.2 (Hijmans et al. 2005b) to map the locations of habitats that were suitable for both P. jordani and P. metcalfi.

If selection associated with climatic factors influences the position of the hybrid zone, one might expect an association to exist between climatic suitability and gene frequencies. For example, if the nuclear DNA of P. jordani confers greater fitness to the climatic conditions in the hybrid zone, then one would expect the P. jordani ILF allele to be present in greater frequency at sites that have higher suitability for P. jordani than for P. metcalfi. To explore this possibility, we employed a hybrid index to score the proportion of P. jordani and P. metcalfi alleles at each site. Our index ranged from 1 (only P. jordani alleles present) to )1 (only P. mecalfi alleles present). Positive scores indicated a greater frequency of the P. jordani allele; negative scores indicated a greater frequency of the P. metcalfi allele. Sites in which P. jordani and P. metcalfi alleles were present in equal frequencies received a score of 0. Similarly, we scored whether each site was more climatically suitable for P. jordani or P. metcalfi by calculating the difference in climatic suitability (i.e. cumulative probabilities from Maxent) between the two species. This climatic suitability index ranged from 100",

Given that models of P. jordani and P. metcalfi (and many other species of Plethodon, see Kozak & Wiens 2006) predict large areas of highly suitable habitat outside of their empirical distributions, overfitting does not appear to have strongly influenced the predicted distributions of these species. Nevertheless, if the climatic niche breadth of either species has been underestimated either because of biotic interactions or because of overfitting, then the overlapping zone of suitable habitats for P. jordani and P. metcalfi in the hybrid zone would in reality be even wider.

Another trend is the atypical patterns of P. jordani and P. metcalfi mtDNA, which reflects an overrepresentation of P. metcalfi mtDNA and a subsequent underrepresentation of P. jordani mtDNA. The third group contains two models that have low DAIC values and insignificant residual deviances. These models -P. teyahalee homozygotes (at the ILF3 marker) and P. teyahalee mtDNA -are the only two models not rejected by the goodness-of-fit test. Overall, these results demonstrate associations among genotypes (rejection of the null model), with a disproportionate underrepresentation of P. teyahalee genotypes in hybrids (for the symmetrical model, the residual deviance for 'parental' P. teyahalee genotypes is positive, and the residual deviances of all hybrid genotypes with P. teyahalee mtDNA or ILF3 alleles are negative). This finding is consistent with observations that P. teyahalee is the most ecologically (based on elevation differences in species ranges) and morphologically (Highton & Peabody 2000) divergent of the three species.",

Second, frequencies of the P. jordani nuclear allele and the incidence of red cheek pigmentation are in close agreement.

The average cheek pigmentation score is 0.9, with 2 of 11 animals having some red pigmentation and a considerable number of P. jordani ILF3 alleles (8 of 20 alleles). There is, however, a complete absence of P. jordani mtDNA at this site. The presence of the P. jordani ILF3 allele extends downslope to 1000 -m elevation, almost to the valley floor. The presence of some red cheek pigmentation extends to the lowest elevation sampled (locality BK at 951 m with an average cheek pigmentation score of 0.125). This pattern is in contrast to the complete absence of P. jordani mtDNA along the transect. Patterns in white flecks are consistent with those of red cheek pigmentation and nuclear DNA. Thus, there is a clear discordance with P. jordani mtDNA being restricted to the highest elevations sampled despite the presence of the P. jordani ILF3 allele and morphology extending much of the way to the valley below. Patterns of marker frequencies are more complicated along the Mt Sterling transect (Fig. 6) . Along the ridgeline of the western portion of the transect (localities ZM-ZI; 1561-1768 m elevation), there is a predominance of the P. jordani ILF3 allele, mtDNA and morphology, although P. metcalfi mtDNA is slightly overrepresented. At localities beginning immediately off the ridge top, there is a complete absence of P. jordani mtDNA. This is in sharp contrast to the patterns of the P. jordani ILF3 allele and red cheek pigmentation, both of which predominate down to an elevation of 1280 m. As in the Palmer Creek and Balsam Mountain transects, patterns in P. teyahalee (white flecks) are largely coincident with those of red cheek pigmentation and nuclear DNA. Thus, the same pattern of discordance between P. metcalfi mtDNA and the P. jordani ILF3 allele and morphology that is found in the Palmer Creek transect is also seen in the Mt Sterling transect.",

Here, we discuss the evidence favouring each of these explanations. Unlike some hybrid zones (e.g. Cicero 2004; Swenson 2006; Mart\u00ednez-Freir\u00eda et al. 2008; Swenson et al. 2008) , we found no evidence that the location of the hybrid zone between P. jordani and P. metcalfi is associated with steep gradients in climate or habitat suitability. The ecological niche models suggest that the climatic conditions are suitable for both species across much of the hybrid zone. Similarly, we found no relationship between the climatic suitability scores for P. jordani and P. metcalfi across the transect and the proportion of samples having alleles that were diagnostic for either species. Thus, it seems unlikely that exogenous selection associated with climate could promote the movement of either P. metcalfi mtDNA (e.g. Boutilier 2001; Nouette-Gaulain et al. 2005; Lynn et al. 2007; Tattersall & Ultsch 2008) or P. jordani nuclear DNA across the hybrid zone (e.g. Doiron et al. 2002; Bachtrog et al. 2006) . The ecological niche models do suggest that the hybrid zone lies in a region containing suitable habitat for both P. jordani and P. metcalfi. Thus, while exogenous, climate-associated selection may not be acting to maintain hybrid zone position, the hybrid zone may nonetheless be constrained by this region of overlapping, suitable habitats. Furthermore, if this hybrid zone is a tension zone (i.e. maintained by a balance between dispersal Fig. 7 and are given as a percentage from 0 to 100.

Male-biased dispersal is often invoked as a mechanism by which nuclear DNA may move across a hybrid zone more readily than mtDNA (e.g. Jockusch & Wake 2002; Garc\u00eda-Par\u00eds et al. 2003) . However, the available evidence does not support the idea that greater dispersal of male Plethodon underlies the discordant patterns of genetic and morphological variation in the hybrid zone. The Hyatt Ridge transect is particularly informative in this regard. Along Hyatt Ridge, dispersal of pure P. metcalfi from the south is impossible, and no pattern of asymmetrical introgression is observed. If greater dispersal of male P. jordani were responsible for the pattern of differential introgression observed in the Balsam Mountain, Palmer Creek and Mt Sterling transects, then differential introgression should also be observed in the Hyatt Ridge transect. In addition, a recent study that directly tested for male-biased dispersal in a related species with similar behaviour and ecology to P. jordani and P. metcalfi (Plethodon cinereus) found that dispersal is equally restricted in both sexes (Cabe et al. 2007 ).",

                "text": "An alternative explanation for the pattern of discordance of genetic and morphological variation is that the hybrid zone is moving. The underrepresentation of P. jordani mtDNA that is seen in the Balsam Mountain, Palmer Creek, and Mt Sterling transects may have resulted from a shift in hybrid zone position southward towards the range of P. metcalfi and downslope towards the range of P. teyahalee. Support for this hypothesis comes from laboratory-staged mating trials between P. jordani and P. metcalfi as reported by Reagan (1992) . Specifically, she found that heterospecific crosses between female P. metcalfi and male P. jordani yielded about a 10% mating success rate (11 deposited spermatophores and eight inseminations of 100 staged crosses), while the reverse cross yielded only a 1% success rate (1 spermatophore and 1 insemination of 100 crosses). Under this scenario, the front of the expanding P. jordani distribution could not effectively remove the P. metcalfi mtDNA left in its wake because of mating asymmetry. Consequently, the extensive occurrence of P. metcalfi mtDNA may best be viewed as a relict, i.e. a 'footprint', of the historic range of P. metcalfi. Lastly, it is not possible to rule out that positive selection for P. jordani cheek colouration (along with linked nuclear genes) contributes to the discordant patterns seen across the hybrid zone. Early studies on P. jordani morphology show that red cheek pigmentation has an aposematic function, serving as a warning to potential predators (Huheey 1960; Brodie & Howard 1973; Hensel & Brodie 1976) . While not toxic, all three species are noxious, and when disturbed, such as during a predator attack, copious amounts of glandular secretions are released from the skin (Huheey 1960; Brodie & Howard 1973; Hensel & Brodie 1976; Brodie et al. 1979) . Another plethodontid salamander, Desmognathus imitator, is likely a Batesian mimic of P. jordani, with about 25% of the population possessing red cheeks like their noxious model (Orr 1968; Brodie & Howard 1973) . Aposematism and mimicry of red cheek pigmentation suggest this trait is under selection, and hybrids possessing at least some red pigmentation may have a selective advantage when the red pigmentation and the associated noxious secretions are common, but a disadvantage when rare.",

Additional work on the introgression of this morphological trait and possible differences in defensive chemistry between species is needed. The dynamics of hybridization seen in the Palmer Creek and Mt Sterling transects, may differ somewhat from those found between P. jordani and P. metcalfi along Balsam Mountain and Hyatt Ridge. First, there is likely to be differential adaptation of the parental species. Plethodon teyahalee is a large species that is restricted to low elevations, whereas P. jordani and P. metcalfi are smaller species that are only found in cool, moist, high elevation habitats. The latter two species may be restricted to high elevations as a result of smaller body size, which leads to greater rates of evaporative water loss (Spotila & Berman1976) . Second, previous studies (Hairston 1980a (Hairston ,b, 1983 1987 ; Adams 2004) have demonstrated that competitive interactions may play a role in the distributions of P. jordani and P. teyahalee. Lastly, P. jordani and P. metcalfi occur at a greater density than P. teyahalee (Highton 1970; Merchant 1972; Hairston 1980a,b) . Population density is one determinant of hybrid zone structure and, when asymmetrical, may result in the movement of the hybrid zone towards the less dense parental species (Barton & Hewitt 1985) . Hypotheses of hybrid zone movement based on patterns of differential introgression of genes and traits have been proposed in other systems. For example, in fire salamanders (Salamandra) on the Iberian Peninsula, Garc\u00eda-Par\u00eds et al. (2003) found strong discordance between mtDNA on the one hand and allozymes, morphology and life history on the other, which they attributed to male-biased dispersal. In another study, a hybrid zone among lizards in the genus Sceloporus of the western United States appears to have shifted 1.5 km as a result of anthropogenic changes to the habitat (Leach\u00e9 & Cole 2007) . Lastly, Rohwer et al. (2001) examined hybridization between warbler species of the genus Dendroica from the Pacific Northwest. Patterns of differential introgression between mtDNA and a suite of morphological markers led the researchers to conclude that the hybrid zone is moving. Independent observations on behaviour and inferences from historical data suggest mating asymmetry may be the cause of hybrid zone movement in that system.",

                "text": "The findings presented here have considerable potential to explain the patterns observed in other hybrid zones among Plethodon in the southern Appalachians. A rapid radiation leading to high species richness (Highton 1995; Wiens et al. 2006) has resulted in myriad hybrid zones among Plethodon in the southeastern United States (Highton & Peabody 2000) . Given the mountainous terrain encompassing the ranges of many of these species, the seemingly narrow climatic specificity of many high elevation Plethodon species (Kozak & Wiens 2006 , 2010 , and past oscillations in climate, we may reasonably expect many of these hybrid zones to be dynamic. One such example occurs between P. shermani and P. teyahalee. In a 20-year study, Hairston et al. (1992) documented a shift in hybrid zone position, which they attributed to changes in land use early last century. More recent analyses, however, suggest that modern climate change may actually be driving hybrid zone movement in that system (Walls 2009) . Hairston et al. (1992) made the assumption that red cheek pigmentation is neutrally diffusing across the P. jordani-P. metcalfi hybrid zone. Based on the most recent warming period during the Hypsithermal Interval (approximately 5000 years ago; see Pielou 1991) , the authors hypothesized that populations of P. jordani and P. metcalfi migrated along the Balsam Mountain ridgeline from their mountain top refuges and met near the centre of the hybrid zone as inferred by the authors. However, the expanded and finer-scale sampling performed in this study uncovered extensive hybridization farther north than that documented by Hairston et al. (1992) , thus nearly doubling the width of the hybrid zone. Furthermore, this study documents a nonclinal transition between the parental species, which suggests a much more complex biogeographic history than the one outlined by Hairston et al. (1992) . A more likely scenario is that repeated bouts of isolation and secondary contact (perhaps as early as eight million years ago, i.e. shortly after molecular clock estimates place the date of divergence; Highton 1995; Wiens et al. 2006) have left a complex, mosaic pattern of hybridization. In addition, severely limited dispersal abilities (as suggested by small home range sizes; Madison & Shoop 1970; Merchant 1972; Nishikawa 1990) , long generation times (every other year beginning at 4 years of age for P. jordani and P. metcalfi ; Hairston 1983 ) and stasis during the 18-year study period of Hairston et al. (1992) suggest this hybrid zone, if moving, may be doing so very slowly. Hairston et al.'s (1992) hypothesis of neutral diffusion gives way to one of differential introgression, and possibly hybrid zone movement, on an evolutionary time scale not readily measured by ecological studies.",
