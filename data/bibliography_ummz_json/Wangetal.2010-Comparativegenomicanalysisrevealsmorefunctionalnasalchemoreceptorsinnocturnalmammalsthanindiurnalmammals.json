However, the genetic basis underlying the evolution and diversity of morphological characteristics, particularly in the context an organism's behavior, lifestyle, and environment, is not well understood. The discovery of nasal chemoreceptors in mammals provided an opportunity to address this question. Here, we identify 4 nasal chemoreceptor gene families (V1R, V2R, OR, and TAAR) from horse, guinea pig, marmoset and orangutan genome sequences, respectively. Together with previously described mammalian nasal chemoreceptor gene repertoires, we found a significant positive correlation between functional gene number and morphological complexity, both in the main olfactory system and the vomeronasal system. The combined analysis of morphological data, behavioral data, and gene repertoires suggests that nocturnal mammals tend to possess more species-specific chemoreceptor genes and more complicated olfactory organs than diurnal mammals. Moreover, analysis of evolutionary forces revealed the existence of positive selection on the species-specific genes, likely reflecting the species-specific detection of odors and pheromones. Taken together, these results reflect a rare case of adaptation to circadian rhythm activity at the genome scale, and strongly suggest that the complexity of morphological olfactory organs and the diversification of nasal chemoreceptors in nocturnal mammals are under selection for the ability to perceive the variety of odors that nocturnal mammals may encounter in their particular dark environments.",

                "text": "Darwinian natural selection has a critical role in the diversity of morphological traits. Although the molecular basis of rapid adaptive selection has been extensively studied for individual genes [1] [2] [3] [4] in past decades, more recently it has started to be investigated at the genome scale [5] [6] [7] . However, little is known about how adaptive evolution drives the diversity of morphological traits among species at the molecular level. This lack of knowledge may be partially the result of an absence of studies of the relationships between morphological traits and their controlling genes in the context of an organism's behavior, lifestyle, and its environment. The mammalian olfactory sensory system (also called olfaction was thought to be specialized for recognizing pheromones [10] . This distinction, however, has been blurred by recent studies showing that both systems can detect both kinds of chemical signal [11] [12] [13] [14] . The morphologies of olfactory organs show striking diversity of size and shape among mammals [15] . For example, rodents' MOEs are well developed, while catarrhine primates have comparatively small and poorly differentiated MOEs [16] . Similarly, a well-developed vomeronasal sensory epithelium (VNSE) has been demonstrated in rodents (e.g., mouse, rat, and golden hamster), and in opossum lagomorphs, but a simpler VNO was observed in ungulates (e.g., horse, cattle and sheep) and carnivores (e.g., dog) [17] . In hominoids and old world monkeys, the VNO is either absent or nonfunctional [17] .",

                "text": "The morphological complexity of the nasal chemosensory systems, as well as the number of nasal chemoreceptor genes, varies substantially among mammals. These observations led to the hypothesis that the functional gene repertoires of nasal chemoreceptors might be positively correlated with olfactory morphological complexity. Though our previous study in a limited number of mammals suggested the V1R gene repertoire is positively correlated to the complexity of VNO anatomy [23, 27] , this hypothesis has not been systematically tested. Another of our recent studies on V1R in mammals suggested that nest-living species possessed a greater number of intact V1R genes than openliving species, and that nocturnal terricolous mammals tended to possess more intact V1R genes than did diurnal species [29] . However, whether this applies to other nasal chemoreceptors in the nasal chemosensory system remains to be determined. Thus, despite the extensive study of the evolution of nasal chemoreceptors [5, 21, [24] [25] [26] [27] [30] [31] [32] , it is still necessary to investigate whether animal lifestyles significantly influence the number of other types of functional nasal chemoreceptor gene (V2R, OR and TAAR). Nocturnal animals depend predominantly on olfactory cues to mediate social interactions and sexual communication, and generally have a highly developed sense of smell [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] ; therefore, we hypothesize that nocturnal mammals should generally have more functional nasal chemoreceptors than diurnal mammals. To test this hypothesis, we identified 4 nasal chemoreceptor gene families (V1R, V2R, OR and TAAR) from 4 recently available genome assemblies (horse, guinea pig, marmoset, and orangutan) with high sequence quality (at least 6\u00d7 coverage) and conducted a systematic genomic analysis of all nasal chemosensory gene families from 12 mammalian genomes in the context of the animals' diverse lifestyles. We provide evidence supporting the hypotheses that (1) the functional gene repertoire of nasal chemoreceptors is a good indicator of olfactory morphological complexity, and (2) nocturnal mammals generally have more functional nasal chemoreceptors that allows them to adapt to their environments.",

The number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (dS) and the number of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site (dN) were estimated by the maximum likelihood method using the codeml program of the PAML package (runmode=-2, CodonFreq=2) [44] . We used the \"site-specific\" model to analyze each of the species-specific clusters with >20 members. First, we estimated the branch lengths on the tree under model M0 (one-ratio) and used them as initial values for further analysis. Secondly, the recommended models (M7, M8) were employed to compare with the null model M7 (beta), which assumes a beta distribution for \u03c9 (in the interval 0<\u03c9<1), with the alternative model M8 (beta&\u03c9), which allows an extra class of sites with positive selection (\u03c9>1). A likelihood ratio test (LRT) [45] was then conducted to test for positive selection. Finally, we identified residues under positive selection when the LRT suggested its presence using the Bayes empirical Bayes (BEB) method to calculate the posterior probability that a site has \u03c9>1.",

We did not investigate the mammalian genome sequences with 2-fold coverage because of their low sequence quality. V1R genes families here were compared with the most recently published data obtained from other identification pipeline [46] , for validating the identification of complete nasal chemosensory receptor gene repertoires. We expected that the majority of, if not all, nasal chemoreceptor genes in these high-quality genomes have been detected, because the comparison results showed tiny difference (\u22642) between two distinct gene mining pipelines [25, 46] . In addition, we updated the V1R gene repertoire in rhesus monkey because it had not been systematically surveyed on a genomic scale, although a few V1R pseudogenes were described previously [47] . To compare our results with others, we used the same classification criteria for gene category as described in Shi and Zhang [25] . Briefly, for each nasal chemosensory receptor gene family, we classified the identified sequences into 2 categories, intact and disrupted genes (see Materials and methods). We noted that the number of intact genes is a conservative estimate, because some intact genes were regarded as disrupted genes because of sequencing errors or partial sequences resulting from the incomplete genome sequences. Figure 1 shows the number of intact nasal chemoreceptor genes identified for these 4 species (and those previously identified in 9 other species) and the amino acid sequences derived from newly identified intact genes are presented in Supporting Information Dataset 1.",

In terms of intact gene number, horse also has the largest functional repertoire (1213 intact genes) of all the described mammals. On the other hand, the smallest OR repertoire previously found was in rhesus monkey with 309 intact genes and 297 disrupted genes. Here we identified 262 and 300 intact genes in orangutan and marmoset, respectively. Both of them have smaller functional repertoires than other primates. By contrast, guinea pig has a large OR repertoire, similar to mouse and rat [49] , with 848 intact genes and 1412 disrupted genes. Our results, together with the previously described mammalian OR repertoires, reveal a 4.6-fold variation in the number of functional genes among mammals.

The smallest V1R gene repertoire is found in the marmoset, with 7 intact genes and 48 disrupted genes. Additionally, a total of 6 intact and 132 disrupted V1R genes were identified from orangutan. In contrast, 34 and 90 intact V1R genes are described from horse and guinea pig, respectively. Thus, the variation in the V1R repertoire in mammals is greater than that of OR (38-fold between platypus and marmoset). Hominoids and old world (OW) monkeys possess vestigial vomeronasal organs, and vomeronasal chemoreception is absent in these organisms [17] . In parallel to the regression of the morphological structures, a pseudogenization process of genes devoted to VNO related chemical communication is found in these primates [17] . Indeed, in chimpanzee and rhesus monkey only pseudogenes have been isolated for the V1R gene family. Although 5 human and one gorilla V1R genes with full-length open reading frames have been described, they no longer experience functional constraints and are subject to an ongoing pseudogenization process [53, 54] . Consistent with these observations, TRPC2, a unique and essential channel involved in vomeronasal transduction, was found to be degenerated in catarrhine primates [52, 53] . Thus, 6 intact genes retained in the orangutan genome are probably relics of an ongoing pseudogenization process, as is seen in humans [53] . However, we unexpectedly found that the number of intact V1R genes in marmoset is similar to that in orangutan. New world (NW) monkeys and prosimians clearly have VNOs [17] and are generally believed to have more V1R genes than catarrhine primates. Although the marmoset genome sequence is not completed, this result is not likely to be due to the quality of the genome sequence because an earlier independent study also failed to find functional V1R genes in marmoset by genome library screening, strongly suggesting deletion of functional V1R genes in marmoset [55] . This observation raises an interesting question of when the V1R functional repertoire shrank during primate evolution. One scenario is that the contraction occurred in the common ancestor of NW and OW monkeys. Another scenario is that the repertoire decreased independently in the OWM/hominoid and marmosets, but not in other NW monkeys. It would be interesting to study V1R gene repertoires in more primates, especially in NW monkeys, to determine which scenario is the real one.",

This number of intact genes is much smaller than in mouse and rat (121 in mouse and 79 in rat) [24] , while the number of disrupted genes is similar, suggesting that a large V2R gene repertoire might be unique in the Muridae family, but not common in all rodents. In addition, we did not find any intact V2R genes, but identified 20 and 24 disrupted genes, respectively, from the orangutan and marmoset genome. One explanation for this result is that both species possess the uniform vomeronasal system [56] , which only contains G\u03b1i2-expressing vomeronasal sensory neurons, where V1Rs, but not V2Rs are expressed [56] . In addition, one intact V2R gene and eight disrupted genes were identified in the horse. This result is puzzling, because the horse was reported to have the uniform vomeronasal system and thus is expected to lack functional V2Rs [56] . It is possible that this V2R gene is expressed outside of nasal organs and has different functions, because our further phylogenetic analysis shows that this V2R gene belongs to V2R family C, which has a distinct evolutionary origin [25, 31] , a different expression pattern [57] [58] [59] , and possibly a distinctive function [24] from other V2Rs.",

If this were true, we would predict a positive correlation between the volume or complexity of the anatomical olfactory organs and the number of functional nasal chemoreceptors. We examined the relationship between the morphological complexity of the corresponding olfactory organ and the number of functional nasal chemoreceptor genes. To exclude the effect of other ecological factors, the semiaquatic platypus was removed from this analysis, and thus this dataset is comprised of the functional V1R, V2R, OR and TAAR genes from 12 terrestrial mammals including 1 Australidelphia, 8 Euarchontoglires, and 3 Laurasiatheria [48] , which are expected to represent a wide range of mammalian phylogeny. First, we found a significant positive correlation between the functional gene number and anatomical size, after controlling for the body weight, in the VNO (R 2 =0.897; P<0.001; Figure 2 (a)) and MOE systems (R 2 =0.948; P=0.001; Figure 2 (b)), based on previously described anatomical data [60, 61] . Considering size alone as a measure of organ morphology is an oversimplification, so we repeated the above analysis using a VNO morphological complexity dataset taken from Takami [17] , which is expected to be a more comprehensive proxy for the VNO anatomical structure. Our results remained virtually unchanged (R 2 =0.61; P=0.002; Figure 2(c) ). Similarly, the MOB complexity is positively correlated with the number of functional OR and TAAR genes (R 2 = 0.755; P=0.002; Figure 2(d) ). These observations suggest that mammals with more complicated olfactory organs generally tend to have more nasal chemoreceptors.",

                "text": "The above finding is further supported by additional lines of evidence. First, owing to their long lasting scent, odorants bring incomparable advantages for mammals to communicate with mates or to detect food in dark environments [62] . Thus, chemical signaling and the sense of smell are used extensively to establish and maintain communication in nocturnal mammals [63, 64] . Second, consistent with our results of the positive correlation of olfactory organ complexity with the number of functional chemoreceptors, the morphological data reveals that nocturnal mammals tend to have anatomically larger or more complex olfactory organs. For instance, the nocturnal mammals tend to have relatively larger MOBs than diurnal species, which could, in part, be due to the nocturnal animals depending predominantly on olfactory cues [15, 16] . In addition, the vomeronasal organs are well developed in nocturnal strepsirrhines, small and extremely variable in platyrrhines, and rudimentary in adult diurnal catarrhines [15, 60, 65, 66] . Moreover, the most complex vomeronasal organs were found in nocturnal mammals [17] . Interestingly, more complicated segregated vomeronasal systems have been reported exclusively in nocturnal mammals (such as mouse, rat, and opossum). It seems that the complex morphology of the nasal chemosensory system is selectively favored in nocturnal mammals. Third, diurnal mammals generally have a well functioning vision system for detecting information from the environment. An extreme case is catarrhine primates, who acquired trichromatic color vision by gene duplication. Color vision helps these primates detect ripe fruits and young leaves and sense the subtle color changes of female sexual organs [67] . However, these primates lost many olfactory receptors and lack the majority of vomeronasal receptors, suggesting that the loss of nasal chemoreceptors in these primates is a consequence of the acquisition of trichromatic vision [52, 68] . By contrast, organisms with primarily nocturnal behaviors always possess poorer vision. As a result of this, opsin genes mediating visual transduction in response to light might have undergone a relaxation of selective constraints and thus might have become nonfunctional pseudogenes. In fact, the pseudogenization of the short-wavelength opsin gene (S opsin gene) has occurred independently in several nocturnal mammals, such as bush babies, loris, lemurs, and blind Ehrenberg's mole rats [69, 70] . If the gain of trichromatic vision is indeed compensation for the loss of nasal chemoreceptors in diurnal mammals, as suggested by several authors [53, 68] , our results would indicate that the chemical-mediated nasal sensory system might be selectively fa-vored in nocturnal mammals to compensate for the defects of the photosensory system.",

The effects of diet and social system are of interest, because olfaction is thought not only a sensor for food detection, but is also used in animals' social behaviors, such as sexual behavior and controlling intermale aggression. On the basis of the main food intake, the 12 mammals can be classified into two different dietary trophic groups: omnivores and herbivores. Interestingly, our results show the different dietary groups have no significant association with the numbers of functional MOE system or VNO system olfactory chemoreceptors or a combination of both (P=0.758). Similarly, solitary mammals do not have more functional nasal chemoreceptors than social mammals (P=0.788). However, we cannot completely exclude the possibility that our observations are affected by the relatively small sample size or the simplification of our behavioral classifications. In the future, it would be interesting to verify our results by comparing the number of nasal chemoreceptor genes in more mammals using more precise classifications of behavior.",

The phylogenetic trees show several interesting branching patterns. First, the nasal chemoreceptor repertoires tend to form lineage-specific clusters and it seems the lineage-specific clusters are more predominant for VNS chemoreceptors than for MOS chemoreceptors, which is consistent with the findings from a recent study [32] . Second, the difference between the phylogenies of nasal chemoreceptors in animals with distinct lifestyles is considerable. Specifically, nocturnal mammals possess more lineage-specific clusters than diurnal mammals (Figure 4 ), suggesting that the nocturnal mammals have acquired more chemosensory genes by the retention of newly duplicated genes. An extreme case is the V2R gene family, in which almost all lineage-specific clusters are exclusively found in nocturnal mammals, with the exception of a V2R family C gene in horses. To quantify the difference in phylogenetic patterns between nocturnal and diurnal mammals, we calculated the proportion of lineage-specific genes in each chemoreceptor superfamily and found a significantly higher proportion of lineage-specific chemoreceptor genes in nocturnal mammals than in diurnal mammals for MOE mediated chemoreceptor repertoires (\u03c7 2 =39.923, P=2.64\u00d710 -10 ) and VNO mediated chemoreceptor repertoires (\u03c7 2 =16.1418, P=5.88\u00d710 -5 ). In addition, we identified 206 lineage-specific clusters in nocturnal mammals, which is significantly more than were found in diurnal mammals (82 clusters) (P=0.01, independent samples t-test). Essentially the same results were obtained when only statistically well-supported clusters (>70% bootstrap) were considered (Table S1 ). The frequent gene expansions that occurred in nocturnal mammals might reflect functional requirements to adapt to their particular environments. Interestingly, lineage-specific gene duplications have also been described in mammalian gustatory chemoreception receptor families, such as bitter taste receptors (T2R), and have been suggested to be adapted to the ecological and dietary diversity in mammals [71, 72] .",

Here, we only tested those clusters that were >70% bootstrap statistically supported as well as having >20 members, because a large number of sequences improves the accuracy and power of the positive selection analyses [75] . Thus, our dataset includes four V1R, four OR, and one V2R gene clusters, all of which come from nocturnal animals (the genetic distance between each of the clusters is shown in Table S2 ). As shown in Table 1 , our results show that the alternative model is significantly better than the null model in all species-specific clusters analyzed (9/9), even after multiple testing corrections, suggesting the species-specific expansions might have been under positive selection. In addition, from each cluster we identified a set of amino acids under adaptive selection using the Bayes empirical Bayes (BEB) method. As expected, most of these sites tend to locate in potential ligand-binding regions. For example, 6/7 putative positively selected sites with >95% posterior probability in V2Rs are located in the extracellular loops, which are widely thought to be important for the interaction of V2R receptor with their ligands [76] . Thus, the above observations suggest that newly duplicated species-specific genes tend to be subjected to diversifying selection, driven by the need to recognize a diverse array of odors that nocturnal mammals encounter in their special dark environments.",

Combining morphological data, behavioral data, and gene repertoires, we revealed that nocturnal mammals tend to possess more species-specific chemoreceptor genes and more complicated olfactory organs than diurnal mammals. Moreover, analysis of evolu-tionary forces reveals the influence of positive selection on the species-specific genes, likely reflecting the speciesspecific detection of odors and pheromones. Our research also suggests that the complexity of morphological olfactory organs and the diversification of nasal chemoreceptors in nocturnal mammals are under selection for the ability to perceive various sets of odors that nocturnal mammals encounter in their particular dark environments. Thus, we provide a case of molecular adaptation to circadian rhythm activity at the genome scale.",
