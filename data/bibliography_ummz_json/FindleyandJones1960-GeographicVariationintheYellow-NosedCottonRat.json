Measurements indicating breadth of the skull, such as zygomatic breadth, suggest that it is indeed relatively narrower than skulls 'of animals of other nominal races of S. ochrognathus. In an effort to increase our understanding of variation of cranial proportions of Sigmodon owing to age of the animals, we prepared scatter diagrams, plotting various dimensions indicative of breadth against condylobasilar length, under the assumption that, in a general 'way, condylobasilar length increases with age. We used all specimens of S. ochrognathus available to us, and also made ,use of an extensive series of S. hispidus of all ages from the Rio Grande Valley in New Mexico. These studies convinced us that skull breadth does not increase at a rate commensurate with skull length in Sigmodon; the larger the skull the narrower it is in a relative sense. The outsize skull of the type of S. o. madrensis fits perfectly on a curve expressive of the rate of increase of zygomatic breadth relative to condylobasilar length in Sigmodon ochrognathus. The same holds true for mastoid and interorbital breadth. In like manner, rostral length, as expressed by length of the nasal bones, does not increase as rapidly as does condylobasilar length. Hence, while the rostrum of S. o. madrensis is actually quite long, it is relatively shorter, not longer, than the rostra of skulls ofS. o. ochrognathus and S. o. montanus. It is about the relative length one would expect from the projection ofa curve expressive of rate of rostral increase in S. ochrognathus. Examination of skulls of both S. ochrognathus and S. hispidus shows that the rostrum becomes less depressed anteriorly with increasing size of the skull. Again, the large size of the type of S. o. madrensis would seem to account for its supposed diagnostic features. Zygomatic configuration varies with age and individually in samples of Sigmodon we have studied; we are not inclined to place .much weight in this feature as an indicator of regional genetic differentiation. The statement regarding the arching of the braincase is not entirely clear to us. The braincase may be arched in lateral profile or in cross section. With increasing age, braincases of Sigmodon become deeper, but no wider, giving the appearance of increasing arching in cross section. It may be that this is what is referred to in Goldman and Gardner's statement. We see little geographically significant difference in the arching in lateral profile of any of, the skulls we have examined.",

For reasons cited below we think that this may be true not' only of \"madrensis\" but also of all populations of Sigmodon ochrognathus from the western side of the Mexican Plateau. In comparing samples of skulls of S. ochrognathus from the Chisos and Davis Mountains with samples from New Mexico, Arizona and Chihuahua, we note that the largest skulls from Texas are slightly larger than the largest western skulls but, when skulls of like size are compared, the skulls from Texas show more tooth wear. If tooth 'wear is indicativeof age in this case, one might conclude that at any given age the western animals would be larger. We do not have western specimens which show as much tooth wear as the larger Texan specimens. We feel that in our sample of western material wesimply do not have any old adults and that, if we did, their skulls would be comparable in size and proportions to that. of the type of S. o. madrensis. It may thus \u2022be that west-Plateau animals of Sigmodon ochrognathus attain a larger adult size than do east-Plateau animals. Such size differences may be a result of genetic difference, but are equally likely to result from nutritional or other environmental differences. Work which we have currently in progress on New Mexican microtine rodents suggests to us that seasonal climatic differences may affect the adult size. of young born at different times of year, so that samples of the. same age from the same locality taken at different times of year, or from the same season of different years, may differ in average size or in proportions. This phenomenon was noted in arctic microtines by Bee and Hall (1956: 146-147) .",

These five seem to be in summer pelage and are markedly paler than specimens from elsewhere in the range of the species except for some individuals in worn pelage from the Chisos Mountains. A specimen referred to as S. o. monianus by Benson, from 4 mi. NW San Luis Pass, Hidalgo Co., New Mexico; taken 1 September 1931, is likewise pale. We are tempted to conclude that S. o. montanus is a pale race except for the following facts: (1) virtually all other specimens of Sigmodon ochrognathus before us are in winter pelage and hence would be expected to ,be darker than the specimens of S.' o. montanus; (2) one ,topotype of S. o. montanus, taken 15 March 1940, is in winter pelage and is much darker than the summer-taken topotypes, but closely matches topotypes of\u2022S. o. ochrognathus in similar pelage as it does specimens of S. ochrognathus from west-central Chihuahua and other places; (3) the specimen referred to from San Luis' Pass, while pale and matching the summer-taken topotypes, is much paler than the 12 winter-taken specimens of S. ochrognathus from the Animas Mountains just a few miles north of San Luis Pass, and also than three specimens in fresh winter pelage (3 Nov. 1954) .from Pacheco, Chihuahua, a few miles to the south.

To the extent that time may be a factor in .Iocal differentiation of mammals we have the impression that the presently disjunct range of Sigmodon ochrognathus has not long been established. It would follow that the presently disjunct.habitat of S. ochrognathus, centered about live oak encinal, has not long been disjunct. Martin (1957: 240-242 ) postulated that the Mexican montane biota of the Chiric.ahua Mountains, including Sceloporus jarrooi, S. scalaris, Crotalus pricei, various oaks and Mexican pines, reached that station during a postglacial period of heavy summer rains, perhaps as early as the Sulfur Spring stage of Sayles and Antevs (1941) dated by Libby (1955) as between 6210 and 7756 B.P. Martin thinks that the present disjunct montane distribution pattern of the Madrean biota resulted from ensuing desiccation. We incline toward acceptance of this sequence of events and think that the range of S. ochrognathus probably became disjunct contemporaneously with that of the Madrean biota, or possibly a bit later, since the habitat of the animal seems to center in encinal rather than in pine-oak woodland. The habitat of the yellow-nosed cotton rat may be almost the most recently fragmented biotic zone in the southwest. Possibly the grassland, which forms a skirt about some desert mountain ranges in Arizona and New Mexico, with encinal above and creosote bush desert below, was continuous more recently. At any rate, the slight degree of geographic variation seen in the yellow-nosed cotton rat is consistent with the postulated history of its habitat.",
