However, it is likely that phylogenetic diversification (phylogenesis) often takes place on the same timescale as colonization and extinction; for example, colonization, extinction, and phylogenesis among mammals on oceanic and/or old land-bridge islands in Southeast Asia are all measured in units of time in the range of 10 000-1 million years, most often in units of 100 000 years. 3 Phylogenesis is not a process that can be treated simply as 'another form of colonization', as it behaves differently than colonization.

In addition, contrary to the implication of the MacArthur-Wilson model, extinction does not drive species richness in highly isolated archipelagoes (those that receive very few colonists) to progressively lower values; rather, phylogenesis is a common outcome in such archipelagoes, and species richness rises over time. In some specific instances, phylogenesis may have produced an average of 14 times as many species as direct colonization, and perhaps 36 species from one such colonization event. Old, stable, large archipelagoes should typically support not just endemic species but endemic clades, and the total number of species and the size of the endemic clades should increase with age of the archipelago. 4 The existence of long-term equilibrium in actual island archipelagoes is unlikely. The land masses that make up island archipelagoes are intrinsically unstable because the geological processes that cause their formation are dynamic, and substantial changes can occur (under some circumstances) on a time-scale comparable to the processes of colonization, phylogenesis, and extinction. Large-scale island-like archipelagoes on continents also are unstable, in the medium term because of global climatic fluctuations, and in the long term because of the geologically ephemeral existence of, for example, individual mountain ranges. 5 Examples of these phenomena using the mammals of South-east Asia, especially the Philippines, make it clear that the best conceptual model of the long-term dynamics of species richness in island archipelagoes would be one in which colonization, extinction, and",

                "text": "I believe that the impact of the MacArthur-Wilson equilibrium model stems from the excitement among field biologists, especially ecologists, that was generated by two inherent aspects of the model. First, prior to the introduction of the MacArthur-Wilson model, communities of organisms, especially those in isolated archipelagoes, usually were viewed as being either static (Dexter, 1978) , with many archaic species representing taxa long extinct on continents, or changing only slowly and unpredictably due to the forces of geology and perhaps climate. The MacArthur-Wilson model presented a diametrically opposed perspective, one in which species richness was the dynamic outcome of ongoing colonization and extinction, in which the longterm geological history of the islands was considered by many practitioners to be virtually irrelevant. Second, the model brought biologists to see for the first time that global ecosystems are effectively entirely insular, with habitat patches and fragments of varying sizes representing a strong analogue of true marine islands. Thus, rather than seeing an entire continent made up of a small number of life zones (as ecologists emphasized in the 1940s and 1950s), the 'new ecologists' of the late 1960s and 1970s were drawn to see almost infinite fragmentation on a continent, in which local colonization, extinction, and re-colonization determined species richness. Stability in species richness and community structure came to be regarded not as the outcome of broad-scale, long-term historical processes, but rather as the dynamic outcome of current processes that operate on a much briefer and more local scale. In the view of many biologists, the MacArthur-Wilson equilibrium model held the promise that all aspects of species richness were determined by processes that could be measured directly during a matter of years, rather than only inferred from data about events that took place in the distant past.",

Others have emphasized the value of the model in identifying and measuring important processes that influence species richness, especially when they have found nonequilibrium conditions (Brown, 1971; Case & Cody, 1983; Heaney, 1984 Heaney, , , 1986 Lawlor, 1986; Lomolino, 1986 Lomolino, , , 1994 .

A model is not simply a way to generate a single prediction, or set of predictions. Rather, it is a deliberately oversimplified representation of how some system should function if only a few major factors are at work. In this sense, it is a way of saying 'all other things being equal, this is the outcome that should be expected. Now, why do we not see the predicted result?' It is the deviation from the simplified prediction, and the reasons for the deviation, that are of interest, not the oversimplified prediction itself. The prime example of such a model is the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium model of population genetics. No one expects to find genetic equilibrium in a population -and if they do find it, it is considered to be an uninteresting result. Rather, the Hardy-Weinberg model allows us to ask why the equilibrium condition does not exist, and thereby we gain a stronger understanding of the genetic dynamics of a population. MacArthur & Wilson (1967, pp. 5-6) explicitly intended that their model be used in this manner, stating 'A theory attempts to identify the factors that determine a class of phenomena and to state the permissible relationships among the factors \u2026 substituting one theory for many facts. A good theory points to possible factors and relationships in the real world that would otherwise remain hidden and thus stimulates new forms of empirical research \u2026 If it can also account for, say, 85% of the variation in some phenomenon of interest, it will have served its purpose well.' 'A perfect balance between immigration and extinction might never be reached. But to the extent that the assumption of a balance has enabled us to make certain valid new predictions, the equilibrium concept is useful as a step beyond the more purely descriptive techniques \u2026' (pp. 20-21) .",

In this context, the MacArthur-Wilson equilibrium model is unlikely ever to be discarded; the experience of the last 30 years has shown that it is too valuable a tool for directing questions in research and for teaching students for it to be discarded as being of no value. This is not to imply, however, that the model is perfect in the sense of always helping to identify all of the most important questions to be asked about the dynamics of species richness. As noted in other papers in this volume, there are a number of ways in which the MacArthur-Wilson equilibrium model can be misleading (e.g. Fox & Fox, 2000; Lomolino, 2000a,b; Ward & Thornton, 2000) . My own interests lead me to focus on issues that involve the evolution of biodiversity. As discussed above, the model was formulated with examples in mind that involve processes that operate over short distances and brief periods of time. What may we learn about the utility of the model if we consider larger scales and longer periods of time? What happens to our view of species richness patterns if we consider not years or centuries, but tens of thousands to millions of years, and large oceanic archipelagoes rather than forest fragments or small land-bridge islands? Are there processes other than colonization and extinction that are equally important? Are there questions that the equilibrium model does not lead us to ask -in other words, does the model mislead us under some conditions into asking fewer questions than we should, and therefore mislead us into developing overly simplistic understandings of the origins of patterns of biological diversity? It is these questions about long-term and large-scale dynamics that this paper is intended to address.",

                "text": "Only a moment's consideration is needed to recognize that patterns of species richness must be influenced by the process that produces species. It is ironic that MacArthur and Wilson chose to explicitly exclude speciation from their graphical equilibrium model. They did so in spite of their familiarity with the topic and Wilson's previous development of a different kind of model (the taxon cycle) that deals with speciation explicitly (Wilson, 1961) , but they chose to develop their graphical model (and most of their general theory) 'at the species level' (MacArthur & Wilson, 1967, p. 5) , and referred to it as a 'population theory' (p. 6), contrasting their 'biogeography of the species' with historical biogeography (p. 183). To their credit, both the 1967 monograph and MacArthur's Geographical Ecology (1972) explicitly discussed speciation, principally in the sense of isolated populations becoming genetically distinct (this process of differentiation from an ancestor in which there is no diversification is termed 'anagenesis'; 'phylogenesis' is defined as differentiation with diversification). Also, their 1963 paper included a section on phylogenesis (which they referred to under the rubric of a 'zone of radiation'), in which they predicted that archipelagoes 'close to the outermost range of the taxon' would show the highest levels of in situ adaptive radiation, demonstrating their awareness of and interest in the issue. However, in the 1967 monograph, this topic was mentioned rather briefly near the end of the volume, and no attempt was made to incorporate it into their graphical model. MacArthur (1972, p. 245 ) subsequently modelled long-term control of species richness as including 'immigration plus speciation', implying that they were additive functions. In the main portion of his text, he mentioned speciation only in the context of this process creating the ideal circumstances in which to study competitive exclusion (pp. 71-74), and not in his discussion of the dynamics of species richness on islands (pp. 79-120). It should be noted that the earlier, but until recently overlooked, independent development of an equilibrium model of island biogeography by Munroe (1948 , see Brown & Lomolino, 1989 included speciation more explicitly and fully, but his inclusion of this process was lost for four decades, along with the rest of his contributions.",

To answer this question, we must determine whether phylogenesis can take place over the same time scale as colonization and extinction. If this is the case, we must ask if it can be treated simply as another form of colonization, as MacArthur & Wilson (1963 Wilson ( , 1967 and MacArthur (1972, p. 245) implied.

Very few studies have been done in a context that would permit measurements (or inference) over 'geological time'. The studies of the mammals of South-east Asia, especially the Philippines, that I and my colleagues have conducted have been developed explicitly to address these questions. Our studies will form the bulk of my examples, and have strongly influenced my viewpoint on this topic. The area is ideal in many respects because of the vast range of size (up to 100 000 km 2 ), geological age (up to 35 million years), and relative isolation of the islands (from a few to hundreds of km), and because the fauna is now reasonably well known. Over 10 000 islands lie within Malaysia and Indonesia, and over 7000 in the Philippines (Fig. 1) , the primary site of the studies described here.",

                "text": "Part of the study area is the Sunda Shelf, the broad, shallow continental shelf extending south from the Asian continent that supports Borneo, the Malay Peninsula, Palawan Island in the Philippines, and thousands of other smaller islands. Included are mainland areas, land-bridge islands isolated from the continent since the most recent glacial episode (and the attendant period of low sea level) that ended about 10 000 years ago, and land-bridge islands isolated since the penultimate glacial episode about 165 000 years ago (Heaney, 1984 (Heaney, , 1985 (Heaney, , 1986 (Heaney, , 1991a . From analysis of the mammal fauna (excluding bats, which were investigated by Heaney, 1991b) , I inferred that extinction was fairly rapid after any given island was isolated from the mainland (Fig. 2) ; roughly 50% of the fauna of nonflying mammals became extinct during the first 10 000 years of isolation on an island of 10 000 km 2 . Subsequently, the rate of extinction declined to a long-term average of about 11% per 100 000 years, so that islands isolated for 165 000 years (in the Palawan region) still maintained fairly large and diverse mammalian faunas ( Fig. 2 ; Heaney, 1986) . It seems likely that the rate of extinction was highest soon after isolation and has now reached a level much lower than the long-term average. None of these islands showed detectable evidence of receiving any colonists during this period (i.e. there was no correlation of distance with residuals from the species-area correlation). On the other hand, a group of tree squirrels showed evidence of phylogenesis having taken place on Palawan Island (area = 11 785 km 2 ) during its 165 000 years of isolation, adding one indigenous species on the island (out of 23, which is about 4.4%), yielding a rate of about 3% per 100 000 years (Heaney, 1986) . The presence of many morphologically distinctive populations within single species in the Palawan region (many of which are recognized as subspecies; Sanborn, 1952) suggests that phylogenesis in the fauna is continuing, so that 3% per 100 000 years may be regarded as a long-term minimum. This single example suggests that phylogenesis might be as important as colonization or extinction in influencing the current dynamics of species richness on these large, very old landbridge islands. Off the north-eastern edge of the Sunda Shelf lie the majority of the Philippine islands ( Fig. 1) , isolated by sea channels exceeding at least 215 m deep (and often more), a depth that is quite unlikely to have been reached at any time during the Pleistocene glacial episodes (Gascoyne et al. , 1979; Heaney, 1991a) . During Pleistocene periods of low sea level, groups of these islands would have merged together to form single larger islands. The configuration during the most recent glacial episode is shown in Fig. 1 . The geological age of these islands varies greatly, from Luzon which originated at least 35 million years ago, to small islands such as Camiguin that are composed largely of active or recently extinct volcanic cones (Hall, 1996 (Hall, , 1998 . All of these islands have indigenous mammal faunas, regardless of how small or geologically young they are. Moreover, on nearly every Pleistocene island, between 50 and 85% of the nonflying mammals are endemican extraordinarily high value that indicates that the rate of colonization is likely to be very low (Heaney, 1986; Heaney & Rickart, 1990; Heaney & Regalado, 1998) . Examination of the number of species and the geological ages of these islands leads to the inference that successful colonization took place roughly at a rate of once per 250 000-500 000 years (Heaney, 1986) .",

Although these estimates must be treated as first, rough approximations, they suggest that all three processes operate on a similar temporal scale in communities of mammals that occur on large, isolated island groups.

Preliminary analyses of the phylogenetic relationships of one of the most diverse groups of endemic mammals, the murid rodents, have not yet produced a robust phylogeny, but they have produced a working hypothesis that clearly demonstrates several important points ( Fig. 3 ; Musser & Heaney, 1992; Heaney & Rickart, 1990; Rickart & Musser, 1993; unpublished data) . These rodents (Fig. 4) include large animals (approximately 2.5 kg) that feed on tender young leaves in the tree-tops; small (approximately 120 g) elephant-shrew-like species that feed almost exclusively on earthworms; and dozens of species that specialize on seeds, fruit, or insects, and which have a remarkably wide range in body forms. My working hypothesis of phylogenetic relationships (Fig. 3) indicates that there have been at least four, and perhaps as many as six to eight colonization events that have produced 56 species. Current data indicate that of these, about 36 species are members of a single large monophyletic clade that contains as much or more morphological and ecological diversity (Fig. 4) than the more famous examples of 'adaptive radiation' such as Darwin's finches in the Galapagos Islands or the lemurs of Madagascar. In this case, we estimate that from four to eight colonization events have produced an average of 7-14 species, but one of these might have produced as many as 36 species (Fig. 3) . As modern murine rodents originated no earlier than the late Miocene, approximately 10 million years ago (Carleton & Musser, 1984, p. 356) , we can take that as an upper limit on the time during which phylogenesis has taken place. However, as murine rodents are not recorded in Fig. 2 Species richness of non-flying indigenous mammals on the mainland of the Malay Peninsula, on islands on shallow portions of the Sunda Shelf separated from the mainland about 10 000 years ago, and on islands in the Palawan chain that were separated from the mainland about 165 000 years ago. Heaney (1986) . the fossil record from South-east Asia or Australasia until the early Pliocene, approximately 5 million years ago (Carleton & Musser, 1984, p. 358) , that may be a more accurate estimate in this case. Given the estimate of four to eight successful colonization events to the Philippines from the Asian mainland, this indicates a rate of 0.4-0.8 successful colonization events per million years using 10 million years, or 0.8-1.6 successful colonizations events per million years using 5 million years as the base line. It is interesting to note that Morgan & Woods (1986) estimated a colonization rate of once per 0.4 million years for mammals to reach islands in the West Indies, although about three-fourths of those involved bats.",

                "text": "These basal colonization events to the Philippines from Asia almost certainly took place at different times; in Fig. 3 , the relative age of the clade is indicated by its position on the graph, from oldest (most basal in murine phylogeny) on the right to youngest (most derived) on the left. The oldest, represented by the genus Phloeomys , are Philippine endemic species that may be the most basal living members of the rodent subfamily Murinae (virtually all of their morphological characters that have been studied are either autapomorphies or they are plesiomorphies for the subfamily; Musser & Heaney, 1992) and may therefore have originated up to 10 million years ago. The largest clades are more derived, and probably fit into the 5-million-year period mentioned above. The youngest, members of the highly derived genus Rattus (Musser & Heaney, 1992) , are likely to have differentiated recently, perhaps less than a million years ago. It is interesting to note that there is a tendency for a correlation between the age of the clade and the diversity of the clade, with diversity measured by number of species as well as by Fig. 3 Phylogenetic relationships of the murid rodents of the oceanic portions of the Philippines, based on data and assessment in Musser & Heaney (1992) , topology in Heaney & Rickart (1991) , data in Rickart & Musser (1993) and , and unpublished data. The dashed line indicates largely unknown relationships to clades outside of the Philippines; question marks indicate uncertainty regarding individual nodes and their possible independent arrival in the Philippines. Brackets indicate the likely endemic monophyletic clades that developed from single colonization events, and the number of species in each clade (the four Rattus species probably have each arrived independently). A single poorly known species of the genus Crunomys on Sulawesi likely represents a colonization from the Philippines to Sulawesi, if the species does indeed belong in Crunomys (Musser & Heaney, 1992; Rickart et al., 1998) . the ecological and morphological diversity of the member species (the oldest clade, made up only of two species of Phloeomys , is an apparent exception to this pattern). The implication is that the longer a monophyletic clade has been in the Philippines, the more phylogenesis has taken place. If this poorly documented but plausible hypothesis is true, extremely rare successful colonization of these islands from the mainland has not been followed by extinction as anticipated under the MacArthur-Wilson model, but by progressive diversification. In this case, in situ phylogenesis has resulted in two to as many as 36 species per original colonization event, averaging 7-14 species per event, or about 3-12 species of Philippine murid rodents per million years, with the number of species increasing over time. Although these figures are rough first Fig. 4 Heads of representative murid rodents from Luzon (not to the same scale). A, Archboldomys luzonensis (a generalized insectivore, 35 g), B, Phloeomys cumingi (an arboreal folivore, 2.1 kg), C, Rhynchomys isarogensis (a primary vermivore, 120 g), D, Rattus everetti (an omnivore, 250 g). From . approximations (in particular, they lack documentation through a fossil record), the examples of 'adaptive radiation' cited above, and hundreds of others involving mammals, birds, reptiles, insects, and plants from archipelagoes around the world (e.g. Heaney & Ruedi, 1994; Wagner & Funk, 1995; Whittaker, 1998) , lead me to believe that such in situ phylogenesis is typical in oceanic archipelagoes.",

First, if it were the case that colonization and extinction always occur at rates that are so much higher than phylogenesis that they simply swamp or eliminate any potential genetic differentiation, then phylogenesis would be unimportant. This is clearly untrue. In many biotas on large, old land-bridge islands, as discussed above, phylogenesis can take place on the same temporal scale as colonization and extinction, and phylogenesis may produce more than 10 times as many species as direct colonization in large, old, oceanic archipelagoes.",

This second condition also is unlikely to be true. Consider the case of a group of islands off the coast of a mainland, initially uninhabited by the focal taxon, that begins to undergo colonization, with the following hypothetical processes operating (Fig. 5) . For islands that are very near to the mainland, colonization rates will be so high that few extinctions take place because of the 'rescue effect' (Brown & Kodric-Brown, 1977) . With a small increase in isolation, the measured rate of colonization (defined as the arrival and establishment of a species not at that time present on the islands) will actually rise, as fewer populations will be 'rescued', and therefore some species will colonize repeatedly and become extinct repeatedly. As distance increases further, the rate of colonization will drop off, reaching the level of extreme rarity, then being absent altogether. In the MacArthur-Wilson equilibrium model, as shown in their famous graphical model and adopted by most subsequent authors, this would be virtually the end of the story -species richness would be very low on a distant island unless the island was so large that the rate of extinction was substantially lower than the rate of colonization. In this model, in which speciation is insignificant, each species present in the distant archipelago would represent a separate successful colonization.",

On islands near to the mainland where the rate of colonization is very high, phylogenesis would be virtually impossible, as gene flow rates would be so high as to swamp out any genetic change that takes place on the islands (as on either very near islands, e.g. Lomolino, 1986 Lomolino, , 1993 Lomolino, , 1994 ; or on recent land-bridge islands where gene flow was recently high, Case & Cody, 1983) . But, as isolation increases to the point that genetic differences can persist (especially on islands off the edge of the continental shelf; Case & Cody, 1983; Heaney, 1986; Berry, 1998) , the potential for phylogenesis (and anagenesis) increases dramatically ( Fig. 5) . At moderate levels of isolation, direct colonization may still account for more species than phylogenesis, but as isolation increases still further and colonization becomes an extremely rare event (i.e. where gene flow (Nm) is much less than one per generation, as in the oceanic Philippines; Peterson & Heaney, 1993; Walsh et al . unpublished data) , phylogenesis will begin to predominate. Because the maximum possible rate of phylogenesis seems unlikely ever to reach the maximum rates of colonization achieved under optimal conditions, I model these curves as having conspicuously different maxima. This is essentially the same prediction made by MacArthur & Wilson (1963 , 1967 ; see also Whittaker, 1998, pp. 110-111) under the rubric of the 'zone of radiation', as discussed above, but which they did not incorporate into their equilibrium model. (The complex mechanisms of phylogenesis are not discussed here. Among Philippine mammals, it is likely that both habitat vicariance and repeated inter-island colonization are involved: Heaney & Rickart, 1990; Peterson & Heaney, 1993; Rickart et al. , 1998 ; see also Grant, 1998a,b) .",

On a large island (or within a large archipelago), the rate of phylogenesis should be virtually nil where the rate of colonization exceeds one individual per generation (the approximate interval at which Nm = 1 is shown as 'A' in Fig. 5 ). Thereafter, as the rate of colonization declines and progressively fewer species are added directly to the island pool, the rate of phylogenesis should increase, and should exceed the rate of colonization over some significant range of distances. Small islands are likely to reach saturation from colonization more quickly than are large islands, and opportunities for phylogenesis are likely to be few. The two curves shown in Fig. 5 could be generalized to a family of possible curves for islands and archipelagoes of varying sizes and degrees of complexity. The actual rate of phylogenesis is likely to vary substantially among taxa, but the general pattern should be found in all taxa.",

A conceptual model (Fig. 6) shows the predicted pattern. On islands near a source, colonization will take place so rapidly that all species will be nonendemic species, i.e. those found in the source area. At the point at which source taxa reach the archipelago less often than once per generation on average (roughly approximated as Nm less than 1.0, shown as 'A' in Fig. 6 ), some populations will undergo anagenesis, and endemic species will be present. I predict that there should be some range of colonization rates at which anagenesis takes place but at which colonization still contributes a significant number of species, leaving little or no opportunity for the evolution of new species by in situ speciation; this is shown as the region between 'A' and 'B' in Fig. 6 . At still lower rates of colonization from the source area, phylogenesis within large, complex archipelagoes should begin to take place; this is the area to the right of 'B' in Fig. 6 . On large, isolated de novo oceanic archipelagoes that are geologically new, or that have experienced a recent significant increase in size, I predict that there would be species of several types: a few nonendemic species (recent invaders from the source area; the area below line 1); a set of endemic species whose sister taxa are present in the source area (the area between lines 1 and 2); and a few species whose sister-taxa are other endemic species within the archipelago (i.e. small endemic clades; the area between lines 2 and 3). On progressively older archipelagoes, I predict that these same sets will be present, as well as species that are members of larger, older endemic clades (between lines 3 and 4), and on still older archipelagoes there should be still larger and older clades (between lines 4 and 5). I predict that, typically, the oldest clades within a given taxon (in this case, the family Muridae) will be the most speciose.",

On islands near a speciesrich source that initially lack the study taxon, all species will be present through direct colonization because high rates of gene flow will swamp out any potential speciation; thus, no endemic species will be present, but many non-endemics will be present. As the average rate of gene flow drops below approximately the level of Nm = 1 for the study taxon (point A), anagenesis will begin to take place, and endemic species will develop, although they will be outnumbered by non-endemic species. These endemic species (between lines 1 and 2) will have their sister-taxon in the source area, not on the island/ archipelago. As colonization becomes still less frequent, and as time passes, phylogenesis will produce endemic clades in which the endemic taxa have their sister taxon on the island/archipelago, not in the source area (species between lines 2 and 3). As more time passes, the oldest clades will become progressively more speciose (between lines 3 and 5).",

This could result in an equilibrium condition which is parallel to that in the MacArthur-Wilson model, in which colonization, phylogenesis, and extinction combine to produce a dynamic condition of turn-over, albeit one that operates on a vastly longer time-scale than MacArthur and Wilson discussed.

However, I predict that such trivariate equilibrium conditions will actually be found to exist only quite rarely on islands in nature. The oceanic archipelagoes where such conditions might develop are geologically unstable; they are virtually always among the most geologically dynamic places on earth, whether in the Antilles, the Galapagos Islands, or in South-east Asia. The geological processes that drive these systems -plate tectonics, volcanism, etc. -are processes that take place on the same scale of time as colonization, phylogenesis, and extinction within such archipelagoes -tens of thousands to millions of years. In the Philippines, during the last three to four million years, virtually the entire southern peninsula of Luzon has arisen; Sibuyan and Camiguin islands have come into existence; and, in all likelihood, some previous islands have sunk beneath the sea. That being the case, the 'equilibrium point' for a given archipelago will change as rapidly or more rapidly than the biological processes can adjust. The appropriate conceptual model thus becomes one of dynamic disequilibrium, in which species richness is always slightly out of phase with the equilibrium point because of the constantly changing physical conditions, sometimes exceeding saturation, and at other times below it (Heaney, 1986; Whittaker, 1998, pp. 141-143) . At times of undersaturation, phylogenesis may especially experience rate increases, adding further to the dynamic aspect of interaction among the three processes.",

Pleistocene variation in global climate that caused changes in sea level that affected oceanic islands like the Philippines also affected mountain chains because of the changes in temperature. In the Rocky Mountain area of North America, for example, changes in temperature and precipitation during glacial periods caused wholesale changes in the distribution of the conifer forest that now forms the classic habitat for mountaintops in the region, allowing such habitat (and the mammals associated with it) to drop to lower elevations and disperse widely over much of the South-west (Grayson, 1993) .",

I predict that the original MacArthur-Wilson equilibrium model will remain a primary cornerstone of the new development, not discarded or superceded, but instead forming a crucial component of future conceptual development.
