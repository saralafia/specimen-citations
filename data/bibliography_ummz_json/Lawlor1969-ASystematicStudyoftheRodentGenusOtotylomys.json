Individuals from those places average larger than those from nearby lowlands. In fact, the size contrast between individuals from the highlands of Costa Rica and lowlands of Costa Rica and Nicaragua is similar to that observed between rats of the highlands of Chiapas and Guatemala and the peninsular lowlands to the north. However, there are two exceptions to this trend. Individuals from Tabasco clearly resemble the large highland variant to the south in all size characters, but they were taken at altitudes of less than 200 meters; and the large rats from 8 mi. S Santa Cruz, Cerros de San Juan, Costa Rica (79), where the climate is similar to the surrounding semiarid flatlands, closely resemble highland individuals from central Costa Rica.",

The large individuals from Tabasco and 8 mi. S Santa Cruz, Costa Rica, suggest that temperature was not the factor favoring selection of large individuals at those places. It is possible that certain geographic similarities in characters of size and color are the fortuitous result of relationships between populations brought about by gene flow. That is, the local character of individuals may have come about partly from their genetic affinities via gene flow with populations geographically adjacent and in slightly different habitats rather than as a direct result of local selection. This is suggested by the lowland Tabascan and Costa Rican individuals (see above) that exhibit characteristics of those from nearby highland populations, and also by individuals of the Costa Rican and Nicaraguan highland populations that exhibit the same ventral coloration of nearby lowland populations, Large size and dark color may be adaptive to the lowlands of Tabasco, for example, but it seems likely that interchange of genes from nearby highland populations may be dampening the effects of selection there. Certainly the clinal effects of variation noted herein also resulted partly from phenomena of this sort, although selection must be responsible for differences in the extremes.",

For example, only individuals from 6 km SSE Palenque, Chiapas, and 20 km NW Chinaja, Guatemala, were intermediate in features of size and pelage among the five localities where intermediate rats are represented (cranial measurements could not be obtained for specimens from Concepcion, Guatemala). This suggests that there is restricted gene exchange at the other intermediate localities. Second, there is a marked difference in the clinal nature of the variation at different places. It does not appear, for example, that intergradation occurs directly between populations from southwestern Campeche and northwestern Tabasco, because of the great differences in the character of the samples from those t\\VO areas; a more circuitous route is indicated. Also, the character shift in northwestern Chiapas is much more abrupt than elsewhere along the zone of intergradation. The gradual nature of the cline in variation in populations from the lowlands of the Yucatan Peninsula southward through northern and eastern Guatemala to the highlands of central Guatemala is more suggestive of primary intergradation.",

The closest ecologic counterpart of Ototylomys in Nicaragua may be Nyctomys sumichrasti. Both are arboreal, forest-dwelling rodents. At San Antonio, Nicaragua, where the two species occur in the same habitat, the activity of Nyctomys is restricted to the upper levels of trees, generally 10 feet or more above ground. Conversely, Ototylomys forages on creepers and branches in places generally below the area of activity of Nyctomys. Occasionally climbing rats were observed on the ground. When frightened, they consistently moved laterally in the trees rather than upward. In one instance, individuals of the two species were observed occupying the same branch. Both species were common in the summers of 1964 and 1966 at San Antonio, where 85 Nyctomys and 56 Ototylomys were collected and others were observed.

Type locality, Tunkas, Yucatan, Mexico. The names o. phyllotis phaeus Merriam, O. p. [umeus Allen, O. p. guatemalae Thomas, O. brevirostris breoirostris Laurie, and o. b. affinis Laurie, are synonyms. The range probably encompasses (1) areas to the east and north of the highlands of eastern Chiapas and central Guatemala, including EI Peten of Guatemala, British Honduras, and the Yucatan Peninsula, and ( 2 ) areas to the south and east of the central Guatemalan highlands, including southern and extreme eastern Guatemala, and Honduras, El Salvador, and Nicaragua. Ototylomys phyllotis connectens Sanborn. Type locality, Coban, Alta Verapaz, Guatemala. Specimens from Tabasco, Chiapas, and the central highlands of Guatemala are assignable to this subspecies. This name is used instead of o. p. guatemalae for individuals from the highlands because guatemalae was named on the basis of specimens that are intermediate between o. p. phyllotis and o. p. connectens. o. p. guatemalae is placed in synonomy with O. p, phyllotis because it more closely resembles phyllotis than connectens. Ototylomys phyllotis australis Osgood. Type locality, San Geronimo, near Pozo Azul de Pirris, San Jose, Costa Rica. This name is tentatively retained for climbing rats from Costa Rica. I have seen no topotypes of this race.",
