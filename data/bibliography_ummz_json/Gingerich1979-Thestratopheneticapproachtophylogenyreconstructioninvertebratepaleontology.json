As such, a phylogeny includes genealogical information on the interrelationships of all the individual members of the group. This pedigree (from Middle French pie de grue, or \"crane's foot\") is normally expressed in a dendrogram. The adaptations of members of a group of organisms are equal in importance to the group's pedigree for understanding its evolutionary history. Pedigree and adaptation together describe evolution, and it remains only to stress the importance of time as the principal dimension of history. In brief, phylogeny as evolutionary history traces both genealogical relationships and adaptations through time.",

Hence it is not surprising that the establishment of evolution as a historical fact was made by geologists and paleontologists. Hutton's original essay on the \"Theory of the Earth\" ( 17 88) found \"no vestige of a beginning, no prospect of an end\" to geological time, infinitely expanding earlier estimates of earth history. Lamarck, Cuvier, and Brongniart in France and Smith, Lyell, and Darwin in England all had firsthand experience working with fossils and their distribution in geological formations. The principle of fauna! succession that we attribute to William Smith is an empirical principle that lies at the heart of our understanding of evolution.

As Darwin first postulated, biological variation, inheritance, overpopulation, and differential reproduction can be combined into one hypothesis, in which natural selection leads to marked and important evolutionary changes in plant and animal species. Enormous advances have been made in our understanding of each of the major components of evolutionary theory since the publication of Darwin's Origin of Species more than a century ago, and we are now at a point where paleontology is once again regaining its 43 former importance in the study of evolution. Many hypotheses of tempo and mode in speciation, and rate and direction in phylogeny, can only be tested by the empirical evidence of paleontology. The fossil record is much better known than it was in Darwin's time, and we now see this wealth of paleontological data generating new hypotheses as well as testing older ones.",

Species may be defined in various ways--one of the most widely used modern definitions being Mayr's ( 1970) : \"species are groups of interbreeding natural populations that are reproductively isolated from other such groups.\" Operationally, living species are almost always recognized as phenetic clusters of very similar individuals (Sokal and Crovello, 1970 ) since data are usually not available to support inferences about interbreeding or reproductive isolation. Morphological variation is distributed continuously within such phenetic clusters, but nonarbitrary discontinuities separate species clusters. Viewing species as phenetic clusters within a multivariate morphometric space emphasizes both the nonarbitrary nature of species and their relational definition since a given multivariate cluster only exists relative to another cluster or clusters. When geographic variation or temporal variation is included, the objectivity (but not the reality) of a species is sometimes reduced, and here again, continuity in the distribution of morphological, geographical, and temporal characteristics is necessary to unify each species.",

Leaving out domestic dogs, we very clearly find two wild species: the wolf and the coyote. It is sometimes argued that wolves and coyotes are really the same species since they occasionally interbreed and either of them can interbreed with feral dogs, and since wolves sometimes appear to displace coyotes ecologically. The fact remains that both are found in the same gen- Histogram of the log of length multiplied by width of M 1 , showing the same pattern of grouping as the principal axis of the scatter plot.

                "text": "The fundamental difference between wolves and coyotes is a difference in body size. Paleontologists sometimes disparage size differences between taxa, stating that a \"real\" difference would be reflected in significant differences in form. Considering the role that allometry plays in maintaining functional 45 equivalence during morphogenesis, many minor differences in form can be adequately explained as a simple result of size differences. Furthermore, there is an increasingly large literature in ecology on the importance of body size as one of the most fundamental components of an animal's adaptation (Hutchinson and MacArthur, 1959; McNab, 1971; Stanley, 197 3; Van Valen, 1973) . Thus, not only do wolves and coyotes form two distinct phenetic clusters, but the major difference between the two clusters (overall body size) is probably the most important adaptive difference between the two. Tooth size is very highly correlated with body size in mammals (r=0.93-0.98, Gould, 1975) , and the teeth on which mammalian paleontologists base so much of their knowledge offer a direct pathway to determining an animal's body size (see fig. 2 ). I shall use this relation of tooth size to body size to infer that significant evolutionary changes in tooth size reflect important changes in overall body size and related adaptations. Figure 2 . Correlation of body weight with tooth size in five sympatric species of squirrels of the family Sciuridae, ranging from the flying squirrel (G/aucomys) to the marmot (Marmota). A similarly high correlation obtains over the entire range of generalized mammals, which makes tooth size a good predictor of the average body size of mammalian species. This correlation can be used in the fossil record to compare the relative body size of related genera and species. Figure is from Gingerich ( 1976b) .",

Much steeper clinal variation is seen in temporal changes in some species. Simpson (1943) termed these temporal clines \"chronoclines\" to distinguish them from geographic clines.

We are looking at change over a period of about 1 to 1. 5 million years at one geographic location, hence this is a good example of Simpson's chronocline concept. Change in Pelycodus, as best it can be resolved at present, is both continul ous and gradual. Evidence that the change is continuous and gradual is given by the fact that wherever the record is sufficient! y dense, there is no statistically significant difference between adjacent samples. Over larger intervals, however, significant differences do accrue as the sum of numerous insignificant differences between adjacent levels. Hence the sample of specimens labeled Pelycodus trigonodus in figure 3 is recognizably different, even to the unaided eye in the field, from most samples of P. mckennai or P. abditus, even though intermediate samples connect them all into one continuous temporal gradient. The result is a continuous evolutionary lineage, subdivided arbitrarily in,.o the segments Pelycodus mckennai, P. trigonodus, P. abditus, etc.",

Ignoring geographic and temporal variation, a species is recognized as a phenetic cluster distinct from other such clusters. Adding a time axis, it is clear that these phenetic clusters sometimes change significantly in morphology through time. Taking this into account, a more general idea of species is that they are arbitrary segments of evolving lineages. The distinctions between two lineages are nonarbitrary (fig. 4) ; their intersection with any time plane shows them to be recognizably distinct clusters, as discussed earlier. On the other hand, the distinction between two successive species of the same lineage is usually arbitrary whenever the fossil record is sufficient! y complete to show the transition. This need for an arbitrary boundary does not mean that differences between two successive species do not exist. Rather, the problem is analogous to one of keeping time. The fact that one o'clock grades continuously into two o'clock does not mean that the two hours are the same; we make a necessarily arbitrary boundary between them and recognize that they are different. Combining relational phenetic clustering with temporal change, we can define a species as an arbitrarily divided segment of an evolving lineage that differs morphologically from other species in the same or different lineages. On a single time plane like the Recent, this reduces to the relationally defined phenetic species of Mayr ( 1969) , Sneath and Sokal ( 1973) , and others, where each species represents one transected lineage. Figure 4 . Diagram showing the relationship between biological species (e.g., A and B) sampled at any given time t and generalized paleontological species viewed as units of evolutionary lineages (e.g., B and C). Species in the fossil record have both a biological dimension (where nonarbitrary morphological discontinuities are used to infer reproductive isolation on any given time plane) and a time dimension (where successive morphologically changing units of an evolving lineage must be separated at an arbitrary, time-parallel boundary). In some instances, lineage branching points furnish natural, nonarbitrary boundaries between successive units of evolving lineages. Figure is from Gingerich (1976b) .",

In other studies, like that of Pelycodus in figure 3, many fossil locali-, ties were tied directly into a stratigraphic section, but others were interpolated based on stratigraphic and geographic position, and on the morphology of a fossil evolving independently of Pelycodus (in that particular case, Hyopsodus). Another possibility is to build up a series of stratigraphic sections documenting superpositional relationships of species of interest and then correlate all faunas containing the same phenetic clusters. This approach uses the classic principle of faunal succession and correlation, and it was used most recently in the study of Plesiadapis evolution in North America (figs. 5 and 6). A fourth possibility is almost entirely biostratigraphical; by postulating a sequence of faunal zones based on the evolution of one group in the fossil record, it is possible to use the resulting zonation to study other independently evolving lineages within this zonal context.

Similarly B-B '-B can be linked together, with B' interpreted as a character innovation developed in the original B that was subsequently lost again by the time of Level 3. The clearest case of linking comes when C in Level 1 is linked to C in Level 2 and in turn to C in Level 3. This represents an example where the same taxon C appears unchanged in all three levels. Several examples of actual patterns of stratophenetic linking in the fossil record of early primates are presented here in figures 3, 6, and 7. In each case, the relative temporal ordering of samples was dictated by independent Stratophenetics 55 lithostratigraphic or biostratigraphic evidence. These examples differ among themselves in terms of density and continuity of the available record. More than 500 specimens of early Eocene Pe/ycodus are known from the Big Horn Basin of Wyoming. Some 245 of these preserve M 1 and come from known stratigraphic intervals, and these are plotted in figure 3. Each successive species is known from many samples within it which show that successive species grade continuously into each other. In North American Plesiadapidae ( fig. 6 ), all of the species necessary to form a connected phylogeny are known, but here the density of the record is somewhat less, which makes it difficult to study the transitions from one named species to another. The European Adapidae ( fig. 7 ) have a record that is less dense than North American Plesiadapidae but still relative! y better known than that of many other groups of mammals. Many lineages, from Protoadapis /ouisi to Anchomomys gail/ardi, for example, can be traced confidently because all of the species necessary to form a continuous connected phylogeny are known. Other lineages (leading to Pronycticebus gaudryi or Cercamonius brachyrhynchus, for example) are much less well known.",

Less well-documented hypotheses, like those indicated by dashed lines in figure 7, are more likely to be modified by future discoveries.

Plesiadapis churchilli links very closely to Plesiadapis fodinatus and Plesiadapis simonsi, and it is probably the ancestor of both. Protoadapis louisi links very closely to Periconodon lemoinei, Protoadapis recticuspidens, and Protoadapis curvicuspidens, and it may be the ancestor of all three. Thus far we have dealt with ancestors in the strict sense, i.e., direct ancestors. A species can be an ancestor in a more general sense. For example, Pronothodectes matthewi is ancestral to Plesiadapis cookei, and Pelycodus eppsi appears to have been ancestral to Adapis parisiensis. Thus, at the generic level, we can say that Pronothodectes gave rise to Plesiadapis and that Pelycodus gave rise to Adapis in the Old World and Notharctus in the New World. These statements can be made with some confidence because most or all of the connecting species are known. In other cases, where connecting sequences of species are not known, it is sometimes possible to make similar general statements about the relationships of genera or even families, although these statements are always less reliable than those regarding species. Obviously, when one says that a family is ancestral to some later, higher taxon, the ancestry is conceived of in a much more general way, with the admission that evidence available at present is insufficient to make a more specific statement about which particular species, or even genus, is actually the ancestor. This problem will be illustrated in discussing the origin of higher primates.",

Paleontology is unique! y suited for study of speciation in natural populations in a natural environment because of the time dimension contributed by the fossil record. There has long been disagreement about the nature of species and consequently about the tempo and mode of speciation. This disagreement has been over whether species are stable and fixed or dynamic and changing. Plato, Cuvier, Goldschmidt, and Schindewolf viewed species as fixed entities, whereas Lamarck, Darwin, and others viewed species as dynamic and changing. As a result, two schools of thought on speciation have grown up, one of which might be called macrogenetic and the other microgenetic. Macrogenesis is the sudden origin of new species or new higher taxa through a saltation of some kind. Microgenesis, on the other hand, refers to a gradual origin of species and new higher taxa by a continuous process of change. Both are possible, and Simpson (1953) , for example, argued vigorously against Schindewolf and Goldschmidt while himself introducing the concept of quantum evolution. Most recently, Eldredge and Gould ( 1972) have again taken up macrogenesis, using discontinuities in the fossil record as their primary evidence (see also Gould and Eldredge, 1977) .",

Eldredge and Gould envision a small isolated subpopulation in a very small peripheral part of the ancestors' geographic range giving rise to each new species. As a consequence, Eldredge and Gould postulate that ( 1) the first appearance of a new descendant species should be marked by a sharp morphological break between it and its ancestor and (2) breaks in the fossil record reflect discontinuities in evolution (the \"punctuation\") rather than discontinuities in sedimentation. They further see most normal species populations as being self-regulated \u2022 by genetic homeostatis and hence essentially unchanging through time (producing the \"equilibria\"). The hypothesis of punctuated equilibria, as originally stated and illustrated, is an alternative to phyletic gradualism sufficiently explicit to be tested in the fossil record, and I have attempted to do this using the remarkably complete fossil record of early Tertiary mammals preserved in the northern Rocky Mountain area (Gingerich, 1976a,b) .

Matthew's (1915) revision is very interesting and instructive, and the data presented above in figure 3 have been rearranged in figure 8 to illustrate his viewpoint. Matthew divided the main group of early Eocene Pelycodus (the lineage from P. ralstoni to P. jarrovii in fig. 3 ) into four species: P. ralstoni, P. trigonodus, P. abditus (= \"jarrovii\"), and P. jarrovii (=\"Notharctus venticolis\"). Using morphological criteria alone (a practice still advocated by many paleontologists), Matthew diagnosed P. ralstoni as having Mi_ 3 11-14 mm in length; P. abditus, Mi_ 3 16-18 mm in length; and P. jarrovii, Mi_ 3 18-19.6 mm in length. Hypocone enlargement was used as a character also but, since it shows a similar pattern, correlated with overall size, will not be further discussed.

The species in figure 8 are defined solely on morphological criteria, whereas those in figure 3 are arbitrarily divided at time lines. Even if the stratigraphic record in figure 8 were as finely divided as possible ( fig. 3) , the evolution of Pelycodus would appear, artificially, to be punctuated simply as a consequence of morphological species definitions. Whenever species are diagnosed by arbitrarily dividing the range of variation of a variable character (typology), the result will be an artificially inflated number of sympatric species and a fossil record that appears punctuated. Since selection cannot operate on characters that do not vary, for all practical purposes this problem of typology applies whenever successive species of a lineage are diagnosed morphologically. Hence the patterns of punctuation and equilibrium that appeared in previous studies of Pelycodus phylogeny now appear as an inevitable result of purely morphological and typological species definitions and of an insufficiently divided stratigraphic matrix. As it now stands ( fig. 3) , the phylogeny leading from Pelycodus ralstoni to P. jarrovii includes three minor \"punctuated\" saltations, but these coincide with gaps in the fossil record.

There is little question that continuous and gradual evolution in place, anagenesis, is important in the origin of some new species. However, punctuated equilibrium is also a hypothesis about the origin of new lineages, and it remains to consider the tempo and mode of origin of new lineages. Eldredge and Gould ( 1972) proposed that all new species arise via cladogenesis, the origin of new lineages. Each species itself, in their view, is a separate disconnected lineage. We have seen that this is not al ways the case, since anagenesis is important in species origins. Now we can consider the geometry of cladogenesis. The Pelycodus example in figure 3 shows P. abditus giving rise to both P. jarr()l)ii and P. frugivorus. As discussed above, P. jarrovii is a continuation of the P. ralstoni to P. abditus lineage, with a gap in the fossil record between levels 1240 or 1300 and level 1480.

As is usual in well-documented transitions, Ichthyostega shows a mosaic of primitive, intermediate, and advanced features linking it phenetically to earlier rhipidistian crossopterygians, on one hand, and to later labyrinthodont amphibians, on the other. A rhipidistian notochordal canal is retained; the intracranial articulation of rhipidistians is absent, but a distinct suture marks its former presence; and postcranially the limbs are well developed. Romer ( 1964) , Schaeffer ( 1965b) , and Thomson ( 1966) have all considered this transition in more detail. Thomson ( 1967, p. 672) emphasized the importance of comparing stratigraphically proximate samples by noting that \"comparison of finely detailed structures in Recent amphibians and Devonian Rhipidistia is of limited value if information concerning the same structures in the Stegocephalia is not available.\" In other words, the best evidence concerning phylogenetic relationships of amphibians to other vertebrates comes from comparison of the earliest amphibians with phenetically similar but slightly earlier fishes.",

In reviewing problems of reptile origins, Carroll ( 1970, and fig. 9 ) has arranged the various groups in question in stratigraphic order. Evidence of phylogenetic relationships can be derived by linking together similar forms of similar age into a coherent pattern. Romeriscus, from the early Pennsylvanian (Westphalian A), is one of several\u2022 important taxa in this regard.

New evidence suggests that Romeriscus and the limnoscelids may be anthracosaurian Amphibia rather than primitive Reptilia (fig. 9) .

Certainly few other specimens have generated such widespread interest or provoked as much speculation and controversy. The reasons are several: these specimens are the oldest known fossil bird remains; they are extremely rare, only five specimens (excluding the solitary feather) are known at present; several of these preserve remarkably detailed im-pressions of feathers and an extraordinary mixture of reptilian and avian characters; and most important of all, because of the last fact, out of all presently known fossil and living organisms, these specimens are widely recognized as constituting the best example of an organism perfectly intermediate between two higher taxonomic categories-representing an ideal transitional stage between ancestral and descendant stocks.",

Again the study of the subdivisions of the coelom indicates that the mammalian diaphragm can be derived from the amphibian structures better than those of the reptiles.

The sub-KBS interval east of Lake Turkana contains specimens that show some tendency to cluster into larger, robust forms and smaller, gracile forms. It is not yet certain that more than one biological species is being sampled in the ................................. sub-KBS interval, but the distribution of tooth size and other cranial characteristics suggests that this is so. By the sub-Okote interval, there are very clearly a robust, large-toothed Australopithecus (or \"Zinjanthropus\") species and a more gracile, small-toothed Homo species. Differences in tooth size are clear, with both samples showing the range and distribution of variation characteristic of modern mammal species. Fortunately, recently discovered crania confirm these differences in a most dramatic way. A gracile skull from this interval (ER-3 7 3 3) is morphologically very similar to that of Peking Homo erectus, with an endocranial volume of about 800--900 cm 3 , whereas a robust skull (ER-406) from the same interval has the brain size and morphology typical of Australopithecus (R. Leakey and Walker, 1977) . Two spe~i mens from the sub-Karari interval separate widely, one being much smaller than the other.

Approached in this way, the fossil record gives a coherent picture of hominid evolution over the past 3. 6 my. The simplest current hypothesis of hominid phylogeny is one of gradual character divergence in two probably sympatric lineages derived from a common ancestor in the late Pliocene. Note that, adaptively, the robust and gracile lineages were as different in relative body size by the sub-Okote interval as sympatric wolves and coyotes are today ( fig. 1) , which Stratophenetics 73 indicates that body size was probably an important adaptive difference between the two hominid lineages .",
