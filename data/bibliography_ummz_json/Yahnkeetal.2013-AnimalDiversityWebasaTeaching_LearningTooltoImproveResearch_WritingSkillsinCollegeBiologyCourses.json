An instructor who increases the academic rigor of a course by incorporating an intensive writing assignment risks pushback by students and, potentially, lower student evaluations, which many universities consider in retention, tenure, and promotion decisions. This situation -students limiting their workload and teachers either fearing poor student evaluations or wanting more time for research -has led to what higher-education researcher George Kuh termed a \"disengagement compact,\" whereby each party agrees to leave the other alone (see Arum & Roksa, 2011) . In a survey of 1000 employers in various industries, less than 10% of employers thought that colleges did an excellent job of preparing students for work (Johnson, 2011) . Further, on key hiring criteria such as adaptability and critical thinking, applicants performed below the employer' s expectations (Johnson, 2011) .",

ADW facilitates inquiry-driven learning, that is, teaching about science by leading students to use the methods of science. The large database is structured, providing consistent information for all species to foster comparisons. The Quaardvark query tool (http://animaldiversity.org/q) allows a user to find information on a specified set of species. Students can explore patterns and relationships, learn how to frame and answer scientific questions and, with the help of a good teacher, experience the excitement and satisfaction of doing science. The long-term goal of the ADW project is to create a database rich enough that students can discover for themselves basic concepts in organismal and conservation biology. ADW also provides a way to make the contents of research museums available globally for teaching and research. Initially, efforts were directed mainly at mammals. Photographs of scientific specimens are available for representative species from most mammal families. Several hundred Quick Time Virtual Reality Movies of skulls are also available. These allow the user to \"rotate\" the specimen, providing an excellent impression of its 3-dimensional structure. ADW staff has written in depth about and illustrated many of the characteristics of interest to students of mammals. An important goal for the future is to encourage species accounts to cover other groups of animals and include other media such as animal behavior video.",

Hildy Miller' s Designing Effective Writing Assignments is a good example (Miller, 2008) . She emphasizes that instructions need to be as clear and specific as possible. A common mistake when designing writing assignments is not providing students with adequate guidance. ADW provides Instructions for Contributors that will guide students through the logistics of writing the account and using the online workspace. There are also resources for instructors. Miller (2008) also suggests designing assignments that offer several choices of topics and allowing students to draw on their strengths and interests. ADW provides an enormous variety of animals to write about, increasing the possibility that a student will find a species that interests them. For two examples of student writing, see Anderson (2009) and Starjnski (2012) (Figure 1 ).",

For example, plagiarism is a problem for high school and college students (Blum, 2009;  Cvetkovic & Anderson, 2010), and we assume that students understand what plagiarism is. In fact, many universities use resources like TurnItIn.com to check for plagiarism in papers, and the ADW editorial staff also checks for plagiarism before publishing a species account. Be proactive by designing an activity that focuses on plagiarism. Also, reading primary literature can be challenging for students. If a student in your course writes a species account for the pygmy killer whale (Starjnski, 2012) , the class can read and discuss a paper on that species (e.g., McSweeney et al., 2009) . Finelli et al. (2005) describe an activity on reading primary literature that works well in a 50-minute lecture period.",

In a contrast between U.S. and Japanese teaching methods, Hess & Azuma (1991) cite numerous examples of American education' s obsession with arriving at the right answers quickly ( reference in Nelson & Harper, 2006) . Teachers from elementary school through college are too willing to answer students' queries quickly rather than let them struggle to find solutions. This research and writing activity follows what Mariolina Salvatori (2000) calls a \"pedagogy of difficulty\" (also see Salvatori & Donahue, 2005) . Although American education resists difficulty and complexity, writing a species account challenges students to persist in attempting to find information on poorly described species. The organisms selected by each student vary widely in the amount of published information available, and students quickly run into a variety of problems they need to solve. Their first response will be to ask you for help. Students need to understand from the beginning that they will encounter problems, they will be challenged to solve them, and they will be given the time and resources to solve them. Some of these problems may include, but are not limited to, a paucity of data on the species, a majority of published resources in a language other than English, information available only in rare books or obscure publications that cannot be accessed online, and difficulty understanding the technical literature. The student is required to research and write for the 12 fields and correctly enter the references (http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Feresa_attenuata/).",

Initially a student may feel unclear about how to proceed and may want to quit or choose another species. It' s important that there be a forum for students and that the instructor discusses these challenges and shares potential solutions, some of which are explicitly outlined in the ADW guidelines. By grappling with ideas, issues, and frustrations, the student gains confidence and increases the potential for creativity and transformation (Nelson & Harper, 2006 ). It' s important that students learn that difficulties are not signs of incompetence or inadequacy. To address this, Salvatori (2000) dev eloped \"the difficulty paper\" as a way for the instructor and student to identify those difficulties and turn them into moments of understanding. A difficulty paper could be assigned in conjunction with a primary literature reading (e.g., McSweeney et al., 2009) to allow students to articulate what they found hard to understand in the text or problems they encountered extracting information appropriate for the assignment. It is an opportunity for you, as an instructor, to model for your students that you also find parts of a text hard to understand (Salvatori & Donahue, 2005) . Difficulty papers could also be assigned at strategic points during the semester (e.g., during the week that references are due to be entered into the ADW template). These are designed to be short, one-or two-paragraph papers that identify common problems to be discussed as a class. As an instructor, it is a welcome challenge to facilitate these discussions as they change from semester to semester.",

A common revelation comes when there is a paucity of data on a species. The most common explanation is that not much work has been done on the species, which often begs the question, Why is that? Another explanation is that the species is a recent discovery or was split from another species (e.g., cryptic species). This provides an opportunity to discuss how fields such as systematic biology and paleontology are hypothesisdriven like any other field of biology. It provides an opportunity to discuss species concepts, molecular evolution, and how technologies like DNA sequencing can transform entire fields of science. Finally, it provides an illustration of how scientists argue among themselves. For example, there is debate regarding the proper scientific name of the mink -Neovison vison or Mustela vison. Regardless of who is \" correct,\" a student writing a species account for the mink would need to know about this taxonomic debate to fully research the animal.",

The survey found that the four most important skills that employers look for in new hires are teamwork skills, critical thinking/ reasoning, oral/written communication, and the ability to assemble and organize information (AACU, 2006) . Incorporating an Animal Diversity Web project into your class addresses the following learning outcomes that employers and recent graduates have identified as important when preparing college students to succeed in today' s global economy (AACU, 2006) Publishing an account provides a student or recent graduate the opportunity to highlight a real-world class project that provides tangible evidence that they met outcomes important to employers, and because the account is published online, it is available for potential employers to see and evaluate.",
