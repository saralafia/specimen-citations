    "abstract": "Bullimus is 1 of 15 genera of murid rodents endemic to the oceanic portion of the Philippines (i.e., excluding Palawan and other islands on the Sunda Shelf). Two species have been recognized previously: B. bagobus, widespread on Mindanao and on islands that were connected to it during Pleistocene periods of lower sea level and B. luzonicus, occurring only on Luzon. Recent surveys have revealed a 3rd species endemic to the small island of Camiguin, located just north of Mindanao and isolated from that large island by deep water. Multivariate analyses support the recognition of these 3 species. The new species of Bullimus from Camiguin is distinguishable from congeners by its smaller size, soft and uniformly dark pelage, inflated braincase, shorter palate and incisive foramina, more divergent molar toothrows, and other cranial and dental features. The patterns of variation and island distribution in Bullimus are consistent with our understanding of regional geography; the 3 species occur on separate islands or island groups that remained isolated during periods of lower sea level. The discovery of a species endemic to Camiguin reflects the fact that this small island is close enough to Mindanao to have received some nonvolant mammals by overwater dispersal, but its isolation has been sufficient to promote speciation.",

As originally described by Mearns (1905) , Bullimus was only vaguely defined and was considered a subgenus of Rattus until Musser (1982) and Musser and Newcomb (1983) reestablished its generic status. The genus was rediagnosed by Musser and Heaney (1992) who noted that the full extent of individual and insular variation remained to be investigated but provisionally recognized 2 species: Bullimus bagobus Mearns (1905) and B. luzonicus (Thomas 1895) . The former occurs on Mindanao and on several adjacent islands that were connected to it during the Pleistocene. The latter is known only from Luzon Island (Heaney et al. 1998) . Heaney (1984) reported the possible occurrence of B. bagobus on Camiguin, a small (265 km 2 ) volcanic island located 8 km north of Mindanao. This record was based on the skull of a juvenile animal collected in the late 1960s that had been mismatched with the skin of a juvenile Rattus tanezumi (Heaney 1984 -specimens identified and annotated by G. G. Musser). Recent field surveys since have produced a large series of Bullimus from Camiguin that represent a new species endemic to that is-TABLE 1.-External measurements (mm), body mass (g), and measurement ratios (given as percentages) of adult Bullimus of 3 species, including a new species from Camiguin Island. Variables are defined in the ''Materials and Methods'' section. First line for each variable gives X \u03ee 1 SD, 2nd line gives range and sample size (in parentheses).",

Statistical analyses were performed using SYSTAT 10 for Windows (SPSS, Inc. 2000) . Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, and observed range) were calculated for sample groups. Multivariate analyses were conducted on log 10 -transformed cranial measurements from adult specimens. A subset of 21 measurements was used to increase sample sizes by including some specimens with minimally damaged crania. Multivariate analysis of variance was used to test for significant differences between taxa.

The 3rd component separated individuals on the basis of breadth of palate at M3 and breadth of mesopteryoid fossa (loadings \u03fe 0.55) and the 4th on breadth of braincase, length of bony palate, and length of auditory bulla (loadings \u03fe 0.43).

A posteriori jackknifed classification correctly identified all specimens from Camiguin and from northern Luzon. One specimen from southern Luzon was classified with northern Luzon. The 2 sample groups from Mindanao and those from 3 smaller islands north of Mindanao (Dinagat, Leyte, and Maripipi) had misclassification rates between 50% and 80%, but in every instance, misclassified specimens were placed with samples from other islands within this same group. The 2 Luzon samples overlap but are separate from the samples from Mindanao and the associated smaller islands, all of which overlap. The Camiguin sample is well separated from the other groups. These relationships are illustrated in a plot of the group centroids and 95% confidence ellipses onto the first 2 canonical variates ( Fig.  2C) .",

The 2nd variate was defined by length of incisive foramina (1.38), crown breadth of M1 (0.55), length of diastema (\u03ea0.75), and interorbital breadth (\u03ea0.86). A posteriori jackknifed classification correctly allocated all 43 specimens. Projection of individual specimen scores onto the first 2 variates shows 3 distinct clusters ( Fig. 2D ).",

Sanborn (1952) described rabori as a separate species from Zamboanga, western Mindanao. There is some geographic variation in body size; the largest specimens, (designated as rabori) are from western Mindanao and the smallest from northeastern Mindanao and the series of smaller islands north of Mindanao (Appendix I- Musser 1982:89, figure 57) . However, discriminant function analysis of cranial measurements from adult specimens reveals broad overlap among the sample groups from these areas ( Fig. 2C ). Pelage coloration and skin pigmentation, features thought to distinguish barkeri and rabori (Johnson 1946; Sanborn 1952) , vary among individuals within local or regional samples and therefore do not appear to be diagnostic.

Available specimens from northern and southern Luzon are comparable in size (Table 1 ; Appendix II); in discriminant function analysis of cranial measurements, the 2 sample groups overlap (Fig. 2C) . B. luzonicus is smaller than B. bagobus in most external and cranial dimensions (Table 1 ; Appendices I and II). The 2 species share similar cranial proportions although the auditory bulla is less inflated and the rostrum is relatively shorter in B. luzonicus (Figs. 3A and  4 ). Discriminant function analyses clearly separate the 2 taxa (Fig. 2D) , with heavy weighting on length of auditory bulla and breadth of palate at M1. Both B. bagobus and B. luzonicus have pelage that is relatively thin and harsh textured, with a strong contrast between the dark dorsum and the pale venter.

On the palmar surface, there are 3 relatively small interdigital pads and a thenar and hypothenar that are large and nearly equal in size. The base of the hypothenar is dark brown, but otherwise the palmar surface is unpigmented and entirely naked. The plantar surface is naked, with dark brown pigment from the heel to the base of the digits, which are unpigmented distally. Plantar pads are more darkly pigmented in some specimens. They include 4 interdigital pads, a relatively large thenar, and a tiny hypothenar. All are small compared with the entire plantar surface.",

It was less common in secondary lowland forest at 900 m elevation, in disturbed lower montane forest at 1,200 m, and at sites in mossy forest habitat at 1,400 and 1,475 m elevations. Specimens were taken in traps placed on the ground, mainly in runways beneath root tangles, under logs, or near large rocks. As in other species of Bullimus, elongate hind feet with relatively small plantar pads and a tail that is substantially shorter than the head-body length suggest terrestrial, as opposed to scansorial, habits (Rabor 1955 , Rickart et al. 1993 ).

Despite its small size, Camiguin supports a relatively rich native mammal fauna of 21 species, 19 of which are found on Mindanao Tabaranza 1997, Heaney et al. 1998) . However, 2 of 4 native rodents (B. gamay and an undescribed species of Apomys) are island endemics, making Camiguin the smallest Philippine island known to support endemic species of mammals (Heaney et al. 1998) .

Two additional specimens of B. gamay, housed at DMNH, are part of a series of mammals collected on Camiguin Island in 1968 and 1969 by D. S. Rabor and associates from Mindanao State University. They consist of crania and mandibles that mistakenly were associated with skins of other taxa and subsequently identified by G. G. Musser as B. bagobus."
