Compared between congeners, sample first principal component coefficients are very similar, an observation that implies a nearly parallel orientation ofontogenetic trajectories in log-measurement space. On the assumption that a common general size factor (estimated as the first principal component ofthe pooled-within covariance matrix) accounts for most of the observed measurement covariance within samples, size-adjusted differences between congeneric species were estimated variable-by-variable in separate analyses of covariance; these differences reflect developmental adjustments of craniodental morphology that precede the measured interval of postweaning ontogeny. Vectors of size-adjusted difference coefficients are not similar from genus to genus, and a diversity of causal mechanisms is probably responsible. Analyses of captive-bred samples from two \"species\" of Zygodontomys provide prima facie evidence that size-adjusted differences estimated from field-collected samples have a genetic basis. Postweaning growth allometries in the muroid head skeleton may be conserved due to the biomechanical constraints of masticatory function; the apparent evolutionary plasticity of earlier ontogenetic adjustments may reflect the absence of such constraints in the fetus or suckling pup.

Because many species can be raised economically under controlled laboratory conditions, muroids also provide tractable experimental models for morphometric research.

The resulting vectors are highly correlated with the sheared-second-principal-component solution ofBookstein et al.

Complex biomechanical adjustments are required to maintain effective masticatory function over the course of postweaning ontogeny (Hurov et aI., 1988) , and it is possible that these constrain relative growth in many ofthe coossified craniodental structures that we measured. The prenatal or early postnatal morphogenetic processes responsible for the conspicuous size-adjusted craniodental differences between congeneric species samples, however, may be evolutionarily plastic because the incompletely mineralized head Although we possess insufficient information to suggest biologically meaningful explanations for every vector of size-adjusted interspecific contrasts computed here, two examples serve to illustrate the diversity of causal mechanisms that might be involved. In the genus Akodon (AKO in Table  7) , size-adjusted dental dimensions vary inversely with the size-adjusted dimensions measured between them: incisor depth (DI), molar length (LM), and molar breadth (BMl) increase as diastemallength (LD) and palatal breadth (BPB) decrease (see Voss et al., 1990: Fig. 1 , for an anatomical map of these dimensions). Explanations for this result could reasonably invoke simple developmental models that predict negative covariances between anatomically adjacent measurement variables (Riska, 1986) . Such covariances might be revealed by analyses ofsecondary factor structure within samples (after Wright, 1954 Wright, , 1968 and Bookstein et al., 1985) , but those exercises are beyond the scope of the present report.",

Instead, functional analyses of the dentition and mandibular musculature, together with knowledge of somatosensory neuroanatomy, and ecology support the hypothesis that these structures covary among members of the muroid tribe Ichthyomyini (to which Rheomys belongs) as elements ofa complex trophic adaptation that is independent of body size (Voss, 1988) . Adaptive interpretations may be appropriate for many vectors of size-adjusted differences between populations and species, but testing such interpretations is difficult and alternative, nonadaptive explanations of interspecific character covariance should also be considered. An important but unexamined issue in many evolutionary and systematic studies, especially those that involve morphological comparisons at lower taxonomic levels, is whether observed sample differences reflect evolved genetic values or represent the environmentally induced responses of plastic phenotypes. The analyses reported here are consistent with the hypothesis that generalsize-adjusted differences between the fieldcollected samples of Zygodontomys from El Frio (ZYGl) and Tobago (ZYG2) have a genetic basis because those differences persist in captives raised under identical ex- ",

We caution, however, that such simple \"common garden\" experiments on mammals cannot eliminate uterine-environmental and postnatal nursing factors as possible causes of observed population differences. A subsequent contri-bution in this series will report the results of crossing experiments with El Frio and Tobago stocks to test explicitly for the segregation ofMendelian determinants oftheir factor divergence. An elaborate developmental model for osteometric variation in the muroid mandible was recently proposed by Atchley and Hall (1991) as a paradigm for explaining TABLE 10.

In this balanced design, 20 female specimens are represented in each of three age classes for both species; degrees of freedom are therefore 1 for species, 2 for age, 2 for interaction, and 114 for error. evolutionary changes in complex morphological structures. They hypothesized that mandibular morphogenesis can be understood in terms offive \"developmental units\" that determine the growth dynamics of primordial cellular condensations: the number (n) of stem cells composing the initial condensation; the relative time (t) of initiation of the condensation; the rate (r) of subsequent cell division; the fraction (f) of the cell population that is mitotically active; and the rate of cell death (d). These cytological parameters of the preske1etal mandibular condensations, and of the adjoining primordia of muscular, vascular, and neural tissue with which the developing skeleton interacts, presumably exhibit variation and covariation that can, in principle, be decomposed into the familiar genetic and environmental components of quantitative genetic theory; therefore, \" ... having knowledge ofthe developmental units which produce a particular complex morphological structure permits quantitative genetic models to be applied to understand the mechanics of evolutionary change\" (op. cit., p. 141). Obviously, however, the statistical analysis ofcomparative data will seldom be informed by such detailed knowledge ofcellular phenomena, and must instead be based on more accessible information about developmental causality.",
