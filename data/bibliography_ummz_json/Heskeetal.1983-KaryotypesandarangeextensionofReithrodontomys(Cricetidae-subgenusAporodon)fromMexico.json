MIMON CRENULATUM KEENANI (CHIROPTERA: PHYLLOSTOMIDAE) FROM BELIZE.-Thirty two bat specimens (17 skins and skeletons; 15 fluid preserved specimens) representin nine species collected by the author in Belize during June, 1975 are on deposit in the Vertebrate Resea Collection at Angelo State University. At least one of the nine species (Mimon crenulatum keenani) represents a new record from Belize a is uncommon in bat collections from Middle America. Identification was based on geographic distrib tion and description as reported by Handley (Proc. U.S."
