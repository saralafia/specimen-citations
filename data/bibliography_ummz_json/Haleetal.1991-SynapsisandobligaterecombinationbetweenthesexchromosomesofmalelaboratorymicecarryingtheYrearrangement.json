The synaptic and recombinational behavior of the sex chromosomes in male laboratory mice carrying the Y* rear rangement was analyzed by light and electron microscopy. Examination of zygotene and pachytene X-Y* configurations revealed a surprising paucity of the staggered pairing configura tion predicted from the distal position of the X pseudoautosomal region and the subcentromeric position of the Y* pseudoautosomal region. When paired at pachynema, the X and Y* chro mosomes usually assumed configurations similar to those of typ ical sex bivalents from normal male laboratory mice. The X and Y* chromosomes were present as univalents in more than half of the early-and mid-pachytene nuclei, presumably as a result of steric difficulties associated with homologous alignment of the pseudoautosomal regions. When paired at diakinesis and meta phase 1. the X and Y* chromosomes exhibited an asymmetrical chiasmatic association indicative of recombination within the staggered synaptic configuration. Both pairing disruption and recombinational failure apparently contribute to diakinesis/metaphase I sex-chromosome univalency, as most cells at these stages possessed X and Y* univalents lacking evidence of prior recombination. Recombinant X or Y* chromosomes were de tected in all metaphase II complements examined, thus substan tiating the hypothesis that X-Y recombination is a prerequisite for the normal progression of male meiosis.",

                "text": "Since Roller and Darlington's (1934) observations of exten sive X-Y synapsis at prophase I in the Norway rat (Rattus norvegicus), the subject of homologous pairing and recombination between the mammalian X and Y chromosomes has been the focus of considerable interest and investigation among cytoge neticists. Over the last 15 years, electron-microscopic analyses of synaptonemal complex preparations have clearly demon strated X-Y pairing in the Norway rat (Joseph and Chandley. 1984) , the laboratory mouse (Moses. 1977a; Goetz et al.. 1984) , and a variety of other mammals (e.g.. Moses. 1977c; Schmid et al.. 1987 : Sudman and Greenbaum. 1990 . Light-microscopic observations of diakinesis and metaphase I configurations reveal a distinct interstitial chiasma between the X and Y chromosomes in some mammals, but these represent unique instances where homologous heterochromatic segments have been added to the original sex chromosomes (Schmid et al.. 1987; Haleetal.. 1991 . and references therein) or where translo-cated autosomal segments comprise a substantial portion of the sex bivalent (Wahrman et al., 1983; Tucker and Bickhant. 1986) . For the majority of mammalian species, a characteristic end-to-end association of the X and Y chromosomes is observed at diakinesis and metaphase I. This configuration has been regarded as a small terminalized chiasma (Ohno et al., 1959; Burgoyne, 1982 : Evans et al., 1982 or as an achiasmatic asso ciation that ensures proper segregation of the X and Y chromo somes at anaphase I (Ashley, 1984) . Inheritance and cvtological data from laboratory mice carrying the sex-reversed(Sxr) muta tion (Lyon et al.. 1981 : Evans et al., 1982 support the chias matic interpretation of X-Y association and suggest that only those cells in which the X and Y chromosomes have paired and recombined can successfully complete meiosis and contribute to the gametic pool.",

Chromosomal banding and in situ hybridization revealed that the Y* rearrangement involved the translocation of a functional centromere and associated major satellite sequences from an unknown chromosome to a position adjacent to the Y pseudoautosomal region. Consequently, the pseudoautosomal region, which is normally positioned at the distal (noncentromeric) end of the Y chromosome, occupies an interstitial position adjacent to the new' functional centromere of the Y* chromosome.

The pseudoautoso ma! region (horizontal lines) of the normal X and Y chromosomes is posi tioned at the distal end of the long arm. The Y* chromosome was generated by translocation of a functional centromere and associated m ajor satellite sequences from an unknown chromosome to a term inal position adjacent to the Y pseudoaulosomal region. Consequently, the pseudoautosomal region (horizontal lines) occupies an interstitial position adjacent to the new func tional centromere of the Y* chromosome. The morphology and m itotic stabil ity o f the Y* chromosome indicate that the normal Y centromere was either inactivated or deleted during the Y* rearrangement. O ur model for the Y* rearrangem ent also includes inversion o f the pseudoautosomal region, as m aintenance o f proper sequence polarity is presumably required for homolo gous alignment and recom bination between the X and Y* chromosomes (Eicheret al., 1991 ) . The numbers to the left o f the Y and Y* chromosomes (a) indicate the position and orientation of the chromosomal regions with respect to the functional centromere. Homologous alignment o f the X and Y* pseu doautosomal regions during pachynema should produce a \"staggered\" config uration in which the centromeric end o f the Y* chromosome is synapsed with the distal end of the X chromosome (b). A single crossover between X and Y* chromosomes paired in this fashion will result in unequal exchange of chro m atin, and, consequently, the chiasm atic association at diakinesis/metaphase I will be asymmetrical. At m etaphase II, the respective chrom atids of the recom binant X and Y* chromosomes should show markedly unequal lengths, (c) For XY (top) and XY* (bottom) meiosis, the expected configurations are diagramm ed as they would appear al pachynema (electron microscopy) and at diakinesis/metaphase I and metaphase II (light microscopy).

The staggered configurations present in early-and mid-pachytene nuclei in volve a short segment of svnaptonemal complex reflecting homologous synapsis between the distally located X pseudoau tosomal region and the proximally positioned Y* pscudoautosomal region. The linear associations, which were unique to the XY* males, are apparently staggered configurations in which the short homosvnapsed region is obscured by one of the thick ened sex-chromosome axes. For X and Y* chromosomes associ ated in this staggered fashion, a single crossover between the aligned pseudoautosomal regions results in disproportionate exchange of chromatin located distal to the recombination site. Consequently, all X-Y* bivalents in diakinesis/metaphase I cells exhibit a distinct asymmetrical chiasma, which is indicative of unequal exchange between X and Y chromosomes (Sud man and Greenbaum, 1990) . In normal laboratory mice, the near-termi nal X-Y chiasma cannot be resolved by light microscopy because the amount of chromatin involved in homologous exchange is very small (Evans et al.. 1982) . Similarly, one lateral arm of the X-Y* chiasma is not cytologically detectable due to the small quantity of pseudoautosomal chromatin transferred from the normal X chromosome to the Y* chromosome. In con trast, the amount of chromatin transferred from the Y* chromo some to the X chromosome is comparatively large, and. conse quently, the X-Y* bivalent exhibits a unique L-shapcd configu ration at diakinesis/metaphase I. The occasional displacement of the centromere of the recombinant Y* chromatid suggests that the smaller side of the asymmetrical chiasma can terminalize completely, thereby releasing the cohesion between the non recombinant X chromatid and the recombinant Y* chromatid. The asymmetrical morphology of the recombinant sex chromo somes in metaphase II cells confirms the regular occurrence of unequal exchange between X and Y* chromosomes paired in a staggered fashion.",

The differential region of the X axis, which normally remains unpaired, would not be affected by this pro cess (Sudman and Greenbaum, 1990) . However, synaptic ad justment is apparently not occurring in the XY* males, since pachytene analysis failed to reveal the intermediate synaptic configurations expected during adjustment of such a consider able length difference. Furthermore, the axial length changes that would accompany synaptic adjustment of length inequali ties (Solari. 1977 1986; Sudman and Greenbaum, 1990) were not observed in early-pachytene nuclei from XY* individuals. 2. The staggered pairing configuration may be susceptible to artifactual disruption by the physical stresses (flattening and spreading) of the surface-spreading procedure, thereby causing the X and Y* axes to misleadingly present as associated unival ents. The predicted staggered configuration of the X-Y* bival ent is presumably more delicate than parasynapsed sex-chromo some associations, since it involves long segments of unpaired axes extending in a radial fashion from the relatively small region of homologous synapsis.",

The observation of unassociated X and Y* univalents in nearly 8% of early-and mid-pachytene nuclei, while only associated X and Y* univalents are present in late-pachytene and diplotene nuclei, suggests that some univalent-containing cells are lost during pachynema. A comparable selection process is evidently operating in human males exhibiting complete X-Y pairing fail ure, as most of their spermatocytes do not progress beyond pachynema (Gabriel-Robez el al.. 1990) . Similarly, pachytene and metaphase I data from XO/XY/XYY mosaic mice suggest that the progressive loss of XYY spermatocytes during pachy nema is related to the presence of sex-chromosome univalents (Palmer et al., 1990) . 4.

The S a t rearrangement involves the duplication and transposition of all or part of the Y short arm. including the testis-determining region, to a position distal to the Y pseudoautosomal region (Evans et al., 1982; Singh and Jones, 1982 : McLaren et al.. 1988 : Roberts et al., 1988 . Tease and Cattanach ( 1989) attributed the synaptic fail ure associated with this rearrangement to structural heterozy gosity within pairing regions containing the Sa t segment on the X or Y chromosome. For the Y* chromosome, the amount of chromatin distal to the pseudoautosomal region is considerably greater than that distal to the pseudoautosomal regions of the XSxr or Y Sxr chromosomes. Thus, structural heterozygosity within the pairing region and resultant synaptic impairment could likewise account for the high incidence of sex-chromo some uni valency in X Y* males. Since the axial telomeres of the meiotic chromosomes are attached to the inner surface of the nuclear membrane (Moses. 1977a (Moses. , b: M oensetal., 1989 , there are apparently steric problems associated with homologous alignment and synaptic initiation at the X and Y* pseudoauto-diakincsis + pachynema metaphase I metaphase II Fig. 4 .

The X and Y* pseudoautosomal regions (horizontal lines) are presumably aligned in an inverted fashion in the parasynapsed X-Y* bival ents.

For diagramm atic purposes, the size o f the X and Y* pscudoautosornal regions is exaggerated in the pachytene configuration. somal regions. The proximal location and inverted orientation of the Y* pseudoautosomal region could result in frequent mis alignment with the distally positioned X pseudoautosomal region, thereby generating the observed asynaptic configura tions. An analogous pattern is seen in grasshoppers (Chloealtis compersa) in which the presence of a terminally positioned supenumerary segment displaces the normal distal region away from the nuclear membrane (Moens et al., 1989) . Pairing is nor mally initiated from the vicinity of the telomeres in this grass hopper. and. consequently, heterozygosity for this supernumer ary segment results in the misalignment and synaptic failure of homologous segments that are normally located at the distal end of the chromosome.",

Chandley and Speed (1987) observed hairpin and bal loon Y chromosomes in XYivr mice and attributed the high fre quency of sex-chromosome univalency to the preferential estab lishment of homologous pairing between the normal testis determining region and the transposed Sxr region on the Ys'Tr chromosome. However, observations of structurally normal X and Y chromosomes assuming similar pachytene configurations (de Boer and Nijhoff, 1981: Speed, 1986; Mahadevaiah et al., 1988; Setterfieldetal.. 1988; Tease and Cattanach. 1989; Tease, 1990) indicate that autologous synapsis is characteristic of uni valent chromosomes, rather than being suggestive of homolo gous pairing between duplicated and rearranged chromosomal segments. Similarly, our data indicate that autologous pairing is not unique to Y* univalents, as it occurs within sex-chromo some univalents from normal XY males and within X unival ents from XY* males. We conclude that hairpin and balloon configurations are the consequence, rather than the cause, of sex-chromosome univalency in XY* individuals.",

(1977) observed pachytene and diplotene X-Y univalencv in (C57BL/6 x DBA)F| males and hypothesized that the univalents in diakinesis/metaphase I cells are the consequence of X-Y pairing failure at zygonema and pachynema. Reports of increased diakinesis/metaphase 1 X-Y univalency concomitant with increased pachytene X-Y unival ency in laboratory mice (de Boer and Nijhoff, 1981: Chandley and Speed, 1987; Tease and Cattanach, 1989) and humans (Speed and Chandley, 1990 ) substantiate this hypothesis. Alter natively, other investigators contend that diakinesis/metaphase I univalency is a result of precocious dissociation of X and Y chromosomes that were svnapsed during pachynema (Imai et al.. 1981 : Matsuda et al.. 1982 . Our observations from XY* individuals indicate that both pairing failure and premature separation account for the sex-chromosome univalency at dia kinesis/metaphase 1. Presumably, a large proportion of diakine sis/metaphase I cells with univalent sex chromosomes is de rived from pachytene nuclei with X and Y* univalents. How ever, the substantially higher frequency of X and Y* univalents at diakinesis/metaphase 1 indicates that premature dissociation also occurs at levels comparable to or exceeding those observed in the XY controls. Without exception, the univalent X and Y* chromosomes present in diakinesis/metaphase I cells showed no evidence of prior recombination. These observations impli cate recombinational failure as the underlying cause for preco cious sex-chromosome dissociation in XY* males. Presumably, recombination is blocked by asynapsis or nonhomologous pair ing of the X and Y* pseudoautosomal regions in the majority of X-Y* bivalents. It is not clear whether recombinational failure is also responsible for diakinesis/metaphase I X-Y univalency in normal male laboratory mice. The displacement of the recombinant Y* chromatid and its centromere in some chias matic X-Y* bivalents (see. for example, Fig. 3c ) suggests that terminalization of the small pseudoautosomal chiasma could prematurely release the X-Y association in normal male labora tory mice.",

The composition of the dicentric chromatids in XSv' Y individuals indicated that the recombination event occurred within the dis tal region of both sex chromosomes, and thus Cattanach et al. (1990) attributed the dicentric chromatids to either crossover error between parasynapsed pseudoautosomal regions or re combination between pseudoautosomal regions that were paired in an inverted fashion. The data from XY* males are consistent with inverted pairing and recombination, as the composition of the dicentric chromatids observed in three metaphase II pairs suggests that recombination occurs within X-Y* bivalents in which the centromeric end of the Y* chromo some is parasynapsed with the distal end of the X chromosome (Fig. 4) . This pairing configuration may actually enhance the frequency of recombination between X and Y* pseudoautoso mal regions aligned in an inverted fashion: while the products of this type of recombination were observed in nearly 10% of metaphase II spreads from XY* males, less than 3% (4 of 138) of the metaphase II spreads from XY males contained dicentric and single sex chromatids. This aberrant X-Y* recombination could not be detected at diakinesis/metaphase I. as the pre dicted chiasmatic association is indistinguishable from that produced by recombination within the staggered pairing con figuration. First-division segregation of the sex chromosomes recombined in this fashion was unusual, as the presence of sin gle X and Y* chromatids in metaphase II spreads indicates that sister centromeres often underwent equational division at ana phase I. Additionally, the dicentric chromatids apparently re mained intact through metaphase II. despite the potential for breakage during the first mciotic division. While the ultimate contribution of these cells to the gametic pool could not be assessed, the recovery of XO offspring from XY* males (Eicher et al.. 1991) suggests that hypohaploid sperm are occasionally generated from spermatocytes in which abnormal X-Y* recom bination occurred.",

As in XY* males, metaphase II cells from 5.\\r-carrying males are derived from primary sper matocytes in which sex-chromosome recombination has oc curred (Evans et al., 1982; Cattanach et al.. 1990 ). The reduced testis weights associated with the Y* and Sxr mutations appar ently reflect the loss of spermatocytes with nonrecombinant sex chromosomes prior to the first meiotic division. In XYS\u00efr males, there is a concomitant reduction in sperm count (Mahadevaiah et al.. 1988) . and in some cases these individuals show oligosper mia and sterility (Lyon et al., 1981) . The fertility of X Y* males is apparently unaffected by the attrition of primary spermato cytes, as these individuals produce normal-sized litters.",
