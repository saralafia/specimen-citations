The Systematic Collections Committee also maintains a list of curatorial standards for managing a collection-accreditation program under the auspices of the American Society of Mammalogists. To date, the Systematic Collections Committee has provided guidance for the more traditional specimen collections (skin, skeletal, fluid, etc.) and specimen data management. Given the rapidly expanding role of genetic resources in biological research, the Systematic Collections Committee herein presents a series of formal guidelines and standards designed to assist collections professionals in the current best practices for curation and maintenance of collections of genetic resources, to ensure long-term integrity of the archived material, and to address personnel safety and guidelines for researchers and curatorial staff. These guidelines and standards are intended to provide constructive guidance and a mechanism of accreditation for collections that vary in scale and infrastructure.",

This and other new methods at the time, such as immunological studies, expanded the role of mammal collections from traditional voucher specimens (skins, skeletons, and fluid-preserved specimens) to include collections of tissue samples (e.g., subsamples of heart, liver, and kidney). Generally, theses samples were collected for single use or a specific experiment, thus were often completely consumed or preserved only in a short-term buffered solution. Otherwise, remaining samples were stored in a researcher's laboratory and not typically archived for long-term preservation in a natural history collection. Early on, preservation conditions typically involved storage in a standard \u221220\u00b0C laboratory freezer and a rudimentary numbering system that often was comprised of the collector's or researcher's initials followed by consecutive numbers.",

Herein are the recommended guidelines and standards for collection curatorial staff as to the best practices for curating and maintaining collections of genetic resources and ensuring the long-term integrity of such archived material. Further, these standards address personnel safety guidelines for researchers and collections staff. The guidelines and standards are organized into six sections (Governance, Record and Data Management, Resource Management, Safety and Accessibility, Resource Acquisition and Loans, and Emergency Response and Preparedness). These guidelines and standards are intended to act as a dynamic document that should be periodically updated and appended as new ideas and methods mature and are developed relative to the management and preservation of collections of genetic resources. Finally, although cryopreserved mammal tissues have most often been used in DNA-, and more recently RNA-based studies, the utility of such collections extends beyond genetics and genomics (e.g., contaminants, stable isotopes, proteomics); the term \"genetic resources\" is used to maintain continuity with previous literature.",

Further, the Systematic Collections Committee serves to provide accreditation to collections that meet a series of minimal standards (American Society of Mammalogists Systematic Collections Committee 2004). To these guidelines and standards established for more traditional collections (skin, skeletal, and fluid), the Systematic Collections Committee now provides guidelines and standards for best practices associated with collections of genetic resources.

These genetic resources are held in trust for the scientific community and are available for study by researchers at universities, museums, and research institutions. b) It is recommended that at least one full-time permanent appointed position (e.g., director, curator, collection manager, faculty member) should be directly responsible for the collection. For shared collections of genetic resources, each discipline such as mammalogy should have a designated staff member assigned to oversee those specimens. Should institutional priorities be changed at some future time, the institution should express a willingness to transfer the collection to another accredited institution that will ensure its perpetual maintenance. The society recommends that the individual responsible for the collection contact the chair of the Systematic Collections Committee of the American Society of Mammalogists, or another appropriate society organization, when care and management of the collection is no longer viable.",

It is recommended that collections maintain catalogues of accessions that track specific tissue types associated with individual specimens, and are linked with information about collecting permits, field notes, and other information ancillary to the specimens. c) Genetic resources associated with type specimens must be identified as such.

To ensure the widest range of genomic data, it is encouraged that tissues should be obtained and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen as soon as possible after sacrifice. Other less-optimal methods include preservation in ethanol, lysis buffer, or silica gel desiccant for ear clips or wing punches. Ideally, the time that tissues were preserved after sacrifice, or indication of the quality of the tissue (i.e., qualitative ranking) if the animal was found dead, should be documented. The preservation method used in the field (i.e., liquid nitrogen, dry ice, specific buffer, ethanol %, etc.) should be documented. b) Samples of genetic resources must be stored and maintained for scientific use in the appropriate environmentally stable environment. Liquid-nitrogen-based systems currently are the coldest and most stable system and provide the best long-term storage for mammalian tissues, RNA, and DNA samples. Colder storage means that liquid nitrogen will better preserve viruses and other microbiome samples contained within the mammalian tissue sample. If access to a liquid nitrogen system is not available, \u221280\u00b0C mechanical frost-free freezers provide the next best storage option. We strongly encourage the use of quality cryogenic vials designed for long-term storage across multiple environments and conforming to current collection management standards. Tissues maintained in a \"lysis buffer\" solution should be stored in evaporation-proof cryogenic tubes at 4\u00b0C or appropriate temperature compatible with the buffering solution. Chromosome preparations or cell suspensions in a \"fixative\" should be maintained in evaporation proof cryogenic tubes (parafilmed tops) at 4\u00b0C and chromosome preparations on microscope slides should be stored at room temperature. c) Genetic samples must be arranged according to a specific storage plan that is recorded and posted. An appropriate tracking system should include multiple levels of information for retrieval purposes (e.g., box, rack, shelf, freezer, room, etc.). Each sample vial should be labeled with an indelible marker, and a typewritten or computer-generated label when possible for permanent, long-term storage. Efforts such as digital barcoding of individual tubes significantly increases efficiency of tissue management. Collections should verify that label stock and inks used for sample organization are resilient to long-term storage at the relevant temperature and conditions. d) Storage room and freezers should be monitored regularly to ensure they provide a stable environment within the desired range of values. A passive electronic system that alerts staff members (both locally and remotely) to issues when they arise is the best practice. Alternatively, manual monitoring would be ideally on an hourly or daily basis and logged. e) Collections must be housed in buildings that provide consistent electricity and adequate protection from fire, water, dust, excessive heat, light, and other agents of deterioration. Appropriate ventilation is necessary to maintain appropriate temperature, humidity, and air element ratios.",

It is recommended that collections have a chemical hygiene plan to inform individuals working in the collection of best practices for handling any potential hazardous chemicals. Associated material safety data sheets (MSDS) should be made easily discoverable in the workspace and available for reference. c) All persons working in the collection should wear suitable personal protective wear depending on the storage system in use.

Appropriate gloves are recommended for handling specimens, chemicals, and supplies at various temperatures. Depending on the biohazards, lab coats may be laundered or disposed. d) Access should be given only to users granted permission by the person responsible for the collection of genetic resources, ensuring minimal damage and degradation to samples and providing for the user's health and safety.
