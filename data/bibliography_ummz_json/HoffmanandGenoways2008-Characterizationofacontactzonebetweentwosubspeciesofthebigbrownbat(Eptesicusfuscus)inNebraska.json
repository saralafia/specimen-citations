On the Great Plains, there are 2 recognized subspecies of the big brown bat (Hall 1981 , Jones et al. 1983 . The eastern race, E. f. fuscus, is larger and darker than the western subspecies E. f. pallidus (Burnett 1983a , Jones et al. 1983 . Exactly where these 2 subspecies come in contact is the subject of debate. A number of studies place the zone of contact in the eastern third of the Dakotas and Nebraska, continuing southwestward into Kansas and Oklahoma (Long and Severson 1969 , Hall 1981 , Jones et al. 1983 . Other studies suggest that the western subspecies, E. f. pallidus, is absent from the southern plains states of Kansas and Oklahoma and that the contact zone is located in the western portions of Nebraska and the Dakotas (Allen 1933 , Engels 1936 , Burnett 1983a , Choate et al. 1986 , Caire et al. 1989 .",

Jones (1964) noted that E. f. fuscus has much darker pelage than E. f. pallidus and that the 2 subspecies could be discerned easily based on color, although some variation within sites was observed. Czap lewski et al. (1979) also described E. f. fuscus as being darker and larger than E. f. pallidus. Data used in the above studies were limited geographically, with no specimens examined from the southwestern, central, or southeastern parts of the state. Subsequent collecting efforts have focused on these areas, resulting in a more complete data set. Thus, a reexamination of the geographic variation of E. fuscus in Nebraska is warranted. The objectives of our study were to (1) determine whether there are 2 subspecies of E. fuscus present in Nebraska and, if so, (2) determine the location of the zone of contact between the 2 recognized subspecies, based on the patterns of colorimetric and morphological variation.",

All of the length variables in females (greatest length of skull, condyobasal length, length of maxillary toothrow, length of mandibular toothrow, and forearm length) were highly and positively loaded on the 1st principal component, whereas all of the breadth variables (zygomatic breadth, postorbital breadth, mastoid TABLE 1. Means and standard deviations of external and cranial measurements (mm) of male and female Eptesicus fuscus in Nebraska, with ranges given in parentheses. The F-statistic from the ANOVA along with the significance level is given for each measurement. breadth, breadth across upper molars) were highly and positively loaded on the 2nd principal component (Table 2) . Both sexes of E. fuscus had similar patterns of color variation. Both PCAs extracted 1 principal component that explained 96.2% (males) and 91.5% (females) of the variation in color. All 3 color variables (R, G, B) were highly and positively loaded on the 1st principal component for both sexes ( Table 3) .",

Ralls (1976) proposed a \"big-mother\" hypothesis where she stated that larger females would be able to produce larger offspring and provide more food than smaller-sized females of the same species. Myers (1978) suggested that females are usually larger because of extra wing loading attributable to the extra mass present during pregnancy and lactation. Williams and Findley (1979) determined that secondary sexual dimorphism in vespertilionids is driven by increased energy demands during pregnancy because maintaining homothermy is more efficient for larger body sizes. In Nebraska, it is unclear which pattern is responsible for the observed secondary sexual variation; however, TABLE 4. Standardized and unstandardized discriminant multipliers of external and cranial measurements for male and female Eptesicus fuscus in Nebraska. Measurements included greatest length of skull (GLS), condylobasal length (CL), zygomatic breadth (ZB), postorbital breadth (PB), mastoid breadth (MB), breadth across upper molars (M-M), length of maxillary toothrow (LMXT), length of mandibular toothrow (LMT), and length of forearm (FA). it seems possible that a combination of these factors is involved. In general, both color and morphological measurements of E. fuscus have a similar distributional pattern across Nebraska (Fig. 1) . Areas in southeastern Nebraska (Buffalo, Lancaster, Sarpy, Webster, and Richardson counties) are predominantly populated with individuals that are large and that have dark pelage. Areas located in northern and extreme western Nebraska (Boyd, Cherry, Dawes, Sheridan, and Sioux counties) are occupied by small and light-colored individuals.

Gloger's Rule was the 1st explanation for color variation; it states that the color of an individual's pelage correlates with humidity, with darker color morphs existing in more humid climates (Brown and Lomolino 1998) . However, this hypothesis has gained little support. A more plausible explanation involves selection for color morphs that avoid detection by resembling the background of where they occur (Dice 1947 , Kettlewell 1961 . Thus, species in habitats where environmental backgrounds are of lighter colors, such as areas of sandy substrates and sparse vegetation, would possess individuals with pelages of lighter colors. Data extracted from the Nebraska STATSGO soil data (available from: http://csd.unl.edu/general/gis-datasets.asp #Soils) show that there are loam and sandytextured soils in northern and northwestern Nebraska where E. f. pallidus occurs. Precipitation in these areas is lower compared to southeastern Nebraska, with an average rainfall of 43.1 cm in the northwest compared to 76.2 cm in the southeast (HPRCC 2006) . These conditions facilitate the presence of arid environments dominated by grasslands in the west and northwest as opposed to more moist forested areas of the east and southeast. This variation appears to be correlated with variation in color among populations of E. fuscus in Nebraska.",

Throughout central parts of the state, the subspecies meet in a broad zone of contact and intergradation ( Fig. 1a-b) . The fact that there is no abrupt step in the transition is not unexpected for mammalian subspecies. The orientation of this contact zone differs from that reported in the previous studies of Jones (1964) and Czaplewski et al. (1979) . Similar to our results, Burnett (1983a) placed the zone of contact between populations of E. f. fuscus and E. f. pallidus running north-south approximately along the Kansas-Colorado state line and then heading in a northeasterly direction through western Nebraska. He concluded that E. f. fuscus occurred in Kansas and in the central and eastern parts of Nebraska, whereas E. f. pallidus was limited to portions of northwestern Nebraska. For E. fuscus in Kansas, Choate et al. (1986) reported a gradual decreasing trend in size from east to west. Those authors determined that not enough evidence existed to support the recognition of 2 subspecies and that only E. f. fuscus was present in Kansas. Our results support the conclusions of Burnett (1983a) and Choate et al. (1986) . We restrict E. f. pallidus as occurring primarily in the northern and western portions of Nebraska, and E. f. fuscus as occurring in southern and eastern Nebraska. Therefore, it is unlikely that many distinct individuals of E. f. pallidus, based both on light color and small size, would reach southward into northwestern Kansas.",

Burnett (1983b) assessed correlation of morphology in E. fuscus with climatic variables throughout its geographic range. He discovered that skull size was inversely related to temperature but directly related to moisture. He also noted that wing size was directly re lated to moisture, but that no significant relationship existed between wing size and temperature. Data from the High Plains Regional Climate Center (HPRCC) show that temperature and precipitation have a pronounced northwest to southeast transition in Nebraska (HPRCC 2006) , with temperature and precipitation increasing in the southeastern part of the state. For example, Harrison, located in northwestern Nebraska (Sioux County), has an average annual temperature of 7.0\u00b0C and an average annual precipitation of 43.9 cm. Auburn, located in southeastern Nebraska (Nemaha County), has an average annual temperature of 11.4\u00b0C and an average annual precipitation of 82.3 cm. If variation in size of E. fuscus is correlated to temperature and precipitation, then the transition from larger to smaller individuals should resemble the climatic patterns present in Nebraska. Our results are somewhat contrary to the conclusions of Burnett (1983b) , because in Nebraska, larger individuals inhabit areas with higher temperatures, indicating a direct, not an indirect, relationship between size and temperature. An explanation is that Burnett (1983b) examined specimens of E. fuscus throughout its entire geographic range, and his broad analysis might have concealed patterns of local variation. Burnett (1983b) did note a positive relationship between size and precipitation, which we also observed in Nebraska. This suggests that precipitation might be a better overall predictor of size in E. fuscus.",

Much of this area represents the Sandhills of Nebraska, which does not generally provide favorable habitat for crevice-roosting bats (Geluso 2006) . For example, E. fuscus is known to roost in tree cavities and man-made structures ( Jones 1964 , Jones et al. 1983 . Because of increased human settlement and fire suppression during the past century, more opportunities now exist for E. fuscus to colonize selected sites in the Sandhills. For example, Thomas County is located in the middle of the Sandhills and is bordered by populations of E. f. pallidus to the north; however, specimens examined from Thomas County, on average, resemble E. f. fuscus. All specimens examined from Thomas County were collected in the hand-planted Nebraska National Forest, established in 1902 (Manning and Geluso 1989, Geluso 2006) . This area is bordered by the Middle Loup River to the north and the Dismal River to the south, both of which run in an east-west direction. As human settlement increased, wildfires were suppressed and grasslands gave way to woody riparian vegetation along rivers. These areas provide excellent dispersal corridors for several species, including bats (Benedict et al. 2000) . For the big brown bat, we suggest that individuals moved westward along these riverine corridors until they encountered buildings located in the man-made forest or in nearby towns, which provided them suitable roosts. Although populations of E. f. pallidus are in close proximity (Cherry County), we would not expect individuals to readily disperse into Thomas County because of the absence of north-south dispersal corridors such as rivers with riparian forests.",

The reason for this atypical coloration of specimens from Banner County remains unclear, but 1 explanation could be the presence of the North Platte River. As in Thomas County, darker individuals representative of E. f. fuscus from eastern populations have likely used this corridor to disperse westward into the region. Conversely, in Dixon County, an eastern county, the individuals examined resembled the western subspecies, E. f. pallidus. Our results indicated that E. f. pallidus is restricted to woody areas of northern Nebraska, such as along the Niobrara River. Dixon County lies along the Missouri River not far from where the Niobrara River empties into the Missouri River. The proximity of Dixon County to the confluence of the 2 rivers may explain the variation present there. Other counties that have individuals that tend to be more intermediate between subspecies might be similarly affected by their proximity to natural dispersal corridors. An example is Buffalo County, which is located along the Platte River.",
