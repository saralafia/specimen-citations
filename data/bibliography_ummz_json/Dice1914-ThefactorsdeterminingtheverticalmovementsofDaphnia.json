The published results show that there is great variation in the movements made by different species, and that the same species in different lakes shows great differences in its vertical migrations. These facts indicate that there is a considerable number of factors which operate together to determine the movements. This paper is presented with the hope that it will help to make clear the relative importance of the factors determining the movements of a common fresh water entomostracean.",

Another experiment (Exp. 2) shows that to the weak light from a 50 watt Edison lamp at 50 centimeters the animals remain positive during a continuous exposure of 60 hours. Probably they would remain positive indefinitely to these intensities. It appears that they are more strongly positive in the stronger light. These daphnids, at temperatures of 20\u00b0 to 23\u00b0 C, are generally nearly neutral to diffuse daylight (Exp. 3), to the light from a 15 ampere electric arc (Exp. 4), or to sunlight lacking the ultra-violet rays (Exp. 5). Experiment 3 shows a rather large variation in the distribution of the animals during the experiment which is probably due to the changes in light intensity corresponding to changes in the position of the sun.",

The ultra-violet rays in sunlight are nearly all absorbed in passing through the atmosphere. However, experiment 6 indicates that the quantity of these rays reaching the surface of the earth at sea level (altitude of Berkeley about 100 feet) is sufficient to have a slight effect in causing negative phototaxis. In passing down through the water of a lake the ultra-violet rays will be very rapidly absorbed. In lakes, at high altitudes, which receive more of these rays than lakes at sea level, and in lakes whose water is very clear the effects the negative phototaxis caused by these rays in the .bright part of the day might operate to keep the daphnids down a short distance from the surface.",

Temperature 21\u00b0 to 22\u00b0 C. Exposed to sunlight with the ultra-violet rays cut off by one thickness of window glass. Frisch and Kupelweiser (1913) state that after a short exposure Daphnia magna and less evidently Daphnia pulex become indifferent to the light and show no decided phototaxis so long as the intensity remains the same. When the light intensity is decreased the animals become temporarily positive while on increase of intensity they become temporarily negative. After a few minutes exposure to a new intensity the daphnids again become indifferent to the light and uniformly distributed throughout the dish. It has been shown above that in weak light or in light of moderate intensity Daphnia pulex remains constantly positive. Within the range of these intensities I have been unable to reverse even temporarily the phototaxis by sudden change of intensity. However, within the limits where the light intensity is strong enough so that the daphnids are normally indifferent, sudden changes of intensity produce the effects noted by the above mentioned authors. The tendency to these effects is probably present on any sudden change of intensity, but in weak light this tendency is overpowered by the normal photdtaxis. It does not seem likely that these temporary changes of phototaxis can be of much importance in causing the vertical migrations of Daphnia.",

Conversely, when daphnids which have been exposed to light of any intensity are placed in complete darkness they show a tendency to rise to the top of the dish. A tendency to positive geotaxis is also found on changing from weak light to stronger light (Exp. 8), or from moderately \u2022strong light to the light from an electric arc (Exp. 9). There is also a tendency of this kind on changing from shade to sunlight (Exp. 10). Negative geotaxis is produced by the reverse \u2022change in each of these cases. The tendency to go to the bottom on increase of light intensity cannot be due to a decrease of locomotor activity as it has been shown by Yerkes (1900) that the locomotor activity increases with increase of light intensity. Neither can it be due to a change of phototaxis because it takes place when the light comes from a horizontal direction. Further, it can be observed that following a great increase of light intensity many of the animals swim directly downwards with the head pointed toward the bottom of the dish. It seems that we have to do here with a change of some sort in the orientation of the animals to the force of gravity. The tendency to move upward following a decrease of intensity is also well marked and must also be due to a change in the reaction of the animals to gravity. Proof that the reversal of geotaxis by changes in light intensity is independent of phototaxis is given in Experiment 11. Here the daphnids remained at the bottom of the dish when exposed to the light from an arc light, no matter whether the light was falling from the side or at an angle of 45 degrees from above or below. When exposed to weak light following the exposure to the arclight the daphnids showed a strong upward tendency indicating that the effect on geotaxis in this case was undoubtedly due to the light intensity.",

The position of these animals kept in the dark was determined by turning on a weak light and taking the observation before the position of the animals could change. The tendency to go down on heating cannot be due to the effect of temperature on the locomQtor activity, because it will be shown in a later section that increase of temperature causes an increase of locomotor activity which would tend to cause the animals to move upwards. Neither can this tendency be due to any effect of light because the tendency is present in the complete absence of light. Seemingly it is due to a change in the orientation of the animals with respect to gravity. We may then suppose that the tendency to move upward on cooling is also due to a change in the relation of the animals to the force of gravity.

In darkness there is an irregular wandering away from a region heated to 29\u00b0 C.

As the animals move upward or downward in response to various other tendencies the changes in pressure experienced might be supposed to modify to some extent the action of these tendencies. However, the only experiment performed to test this supposition gave negative results. In this experiment an increase in water pressure roughly guessed at 15 pounds did not seem to cause any change in the vertical distribution of the animals. The extensive daily migrations performed by some species of Daphnia, 32 meters in Daphnia hyalina (Burckhardt, 1900) , also argues against pressure being of importance in modifying the factors causing the vertical movements in this genus.",

To intensities above this, at a temperature of 20\u00b0 C, the animals are normally neutral. Only in high temperatures and strong light do they show a negative phototaxis. The positive phototaxis of the daphnids will prevent them from going much below the lower limit of neutral intensity, but, as far as the phototaxis is concerned, they might occur at any level in the neutral intensity.

As the light increases in intensity they will continue to move downward, owing to the continued increasing positive geotaxis, and will keep near the lower Hmit of neutral phototaxis. The downward movement then is due to the action of light on the geotaxis, but the limit of downward motion is determined partly by the phototaxis. In the evening as the daylight fades the daphnids move upward, owing partly to the negative geotaxis caused by lowered light intensity, and partly due to the positive phototaxis caused by weak light. At night the daphnids remain near the surface due to the negative geotaxis existing in the absence of light.

For this reason the lower limit of daily movement in Daphnia should be deeper in summer than in winter. However, the range of motion may be less in summer than in winter owing to the effect of the higher temperatures of the surface waters in summer on the geotaxis. It seems that the change of the midday light intensities with the seasons will have a much smaller effect in determining the mean daily depth than will the changes in temperature. Cloudy weather should have the effect of raising the mean vertical position of the daphnids. In partly clouded weather the passage of a cloud across the sun should reduce the light intensity enough to cause a tendency to negative geotaxis and positive phototaxis which would cause an upward movement of the animals.

We should then not expect to find the same migration behavior in every lake. VERTICAL MOVEMENTS CAUSED BY CHANGES IN TEMPERATURE Few observations are at hand to show the variation during the day of the water temperatures at different levels in a lake, but this variation is much greater in shallow than in deep lakes. A table given by Hankinson (1907, p. 202) shows a variation of three degrees in the surface temperature, during May 29, in a shallow part of Walnut Lake, Michigan. The daily variations in temperature of some shallow lakes must be greater than this, but in most lakes the variation in the temperature of the surface water will be very small and there will be almost no diurnal variation in the temperature of the lower levels.

If we consider them moving downward in the early morning in response to increase of light intensity they will be moving into water at lower and lower temperatures. These low temperatures will have a tendency to produce negative geotaxis and positive phototaxis. These tendencies will operate to reduce the range of the downward movement. On moving upward in the evening the animals will be reaching increasing temperatures of water. These higher temperatures will have a tendency to produce positive geotaxis. If the surface temperature is in the neighborhood of 25\u00b0 C. there will be a slowing up of the locomotor activity after a short exposure to that amount of heat. Irregular wandering away from the high temperature may also be operative. These factors will then work together to lessen the distance of upward travel in summer.

In lakes where the lower levels are stagnant the daphnids will likely be killed soon after they drop below the thermocline.",

It may be that with more exact and thoroughgoing methods of research many of the apparent exceptions could be shown to be due to normal processes.

However, it may be observed in many cases, particularly on shading a tall jar of daphnids exposed in sunlight, that there is an immediate and vigorous upward movement. The failure of some to move to the top when the tendency is in that direction must be due in part to the weight of the body, which has a constant tendency to drag the animal \"down. It is. probably also due in part to the unnatural conditions under which the animals were kept. It was observed that daphnids. freshly collected from natural ponds showed a greater tendency to upward movement than those kept for a long time in the laboratory. There is the further fact that the jars used for experimentation have a very slight depth in comparison with the average depth of a lake so that the available range of movement was very small.

They may sink several centimeters, but usually soon regain the former position by a few rapid strokes of the antennae.
