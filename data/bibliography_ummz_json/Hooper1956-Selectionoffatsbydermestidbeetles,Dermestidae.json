Food scattered for it on the basement floor disappeared regularly. Moreover, the floor of the cold room gradually became a shambles of sand and bricks, caused by the collapse of rat-made tunnels through the sandy sub. strate and by frequent movement of the sand. On the occasions when the animal was observed closely, as for example when it was fed from an observer's hand, it always appeared to be in excellent health. It was killed by the family pet dog about January 15, 1955. Its known age was at least four and one-half years.",

The animals apparently require lipids to remain healthy, to complete their life cycle in optimum time, and to produce large broods. The larvae of Attagenu8 piceus develop faster and have a lower mortality on a diet that includes fish meal than on one that lacks the meal (Griswold, Cornell Univ. Agr. Exp. Sta. Mem., 240, 1941) . In Dermestes vulpinus fat is necessary for maximum egg production and healthy larvae. Beetles restricted to a diet of dry, lean meat produced few eggs. The larvae were sluggish and many died; those that matured were undersize (Russell, Jour. Mamm., 28: 284-287, 1947) . Materials that normally are unsavory to beetles can be made more or less attractive to them when the materials are coated with oil. Dermestes will clean specimens that have been preserved in alcohol if the specimens are first soaked in water and dipped in bacon grease or beef fat (de la Torre, Jour. Mamm., 32: 231-232, 1951) . These and other studies make it clear that fats are important to dermestid beetles.",

The extra tray served as a control and a refuge for dermestids that sought shelter, not food. Twenty-five to forty larvae were then introduced into the cans and the lid was locked in place. About twenty-four hours later the cover was removed and the numbers of larvae in each tray and \"on the loose\" were recorded.

Our technique is simple. The treatment of a group of 30 dry, borax-coated skulls of Tamias and Citellu8 will illustrate. The skulls were washed for about two hours in warm running water, to remove most of the borax and to soften the flesh. They were then drained, dipped in warm oil, and placed in trays in the beetle colony. Many of them were cleaned within 24 hours; all were complete after 48 hours. The rate of cleaning, of course, varies with the size of the populations, amount and type of available food, and other factors.",

If the skulls are too wet and too numerous, so that the larvae can't clean them within a day, a lush growth of mold may develop. The ideal is to balance the food against the population so that the skeletal material will be cleaned within a day or so. Too much oil also may be disastrous. When dermestid eggs are coated with oil they will not hatch (Russell, loe. cit.) . We intend to reduce the coating of oil, by using emulsions or suspensions instead of pure oil. We also shall see that each colony has food and breeding places other than those provided by the oil-soaked skulls. Stable refuges and semipermanent, oil-free sites suitable for the deposition and development of eggs are essential to a continuing colony of dermestids. Codliver oil may prove to be useful in the cleaning of osteological materials.-EMMET T. HOOPER, University of Michigan Museum of Zoology, Ann Arbor. Received April 21 ,1955.",
