The F, hybrids were not morphologically intermediate between race E and races F or G, but were more similar to the latter pair of races than to the former race. No ecological differences with regard to soil preferences were found among the three races and hybrids. The limited size of the contact zone and the apparent lack of backcrossing suggest that race E and races F and G interact as biological species where they contact. The absence of any detectable premating isolating mechanisms may be correlated with the recency of the contact zone. It is suggested that races F and G have invaded the existing range of race E, possibly as a consequence of the effects of man-made disturbances such as agriculture and the building of road rightsof-way.",

Principal component one (PCI) accounted for 68.89% of the variation and PCII for 9.12%. PCI apparently is a size vector related to skull length; characters contributing heavily to this vector include greatest length of skull, basal length, length of rostrum, and palatal length (Table 2) . pcn appears to be related to shape of the skull. Interorbital breadth had the highest percent influence on this vector (Table 2) . Subsequent to the principal components analysis the 68 individual female pocket gophers were grouped into the same five samples (based on karyotype and locality) used for previous analyses. Single classification analyses of variance among the five samples were then perfonned using values of each on each of the first two principal components. Samples were found to be significantly different (P \",;: 0.05) for PCI but not for PCII. A Duncan's multiple range test was then conducted using PCI scores. References of F and G (sample two) and hybrids E by F and E hy G (sample five) were found to be significantly different from references of race E (sample one), race E from the contact zone (sample three), and the single race G individual from the contact zone (sample four). These results correspond with those of the univariate analyses for females. Race E reference individuals differ significantly from references of races F and G, and hybrid E by F and E by G individuals are morphologically more similar to races F and G than to race E. Physical factors affecting distribution of pocket gophers.-The gophers collected in this study inhabited soils in the Ships\u2022Norwood-Yahola Soil Association. These consist of clay, silt loam to silty clay, and silt loam to very fine loam soils. Ninetyseven soil samples were analyzed for percent sand, silt, and clay and each sample was plotted on a textural triangle (Fig. 5) to detennine if there was a correlation between soil texture and the distribution of the three chromosome races and hybrids. Fortyone samples from within the contact zone fall within five major textural classes: sandy loam, loam, clay loam, silt loam and silty clay loam (Fig. Sa) . No differences in soil preferences were found among the chromosome races and hybrids. Gophers immediately surrounding the zone were found in similar soils with the exception of seven race E individuals collected in sandy clay loam, sandy loam, and loamy sand soils (Fig. 5b) . These latter individuals were all taken from an area east of the oxbow lake ( Fig. 3) and included juveniles collected from a temporary sand bar on the edge of the lake. Two soil samples were taken from an area devoid of gophers adjacent to the contact zone. These were analyzed for soil texture and plotted on the textural triangle (Fig. 5b) . Soil here was found to be high in percent clay (76 and 68% for the two samples).",

Hart (1978) studied the contact zone between races D (2N = 72, FN = 70) and E in Oklahoma, and reported a single F 1 hybrid. Hart concluded that, although a more detailed analysis was necessary, some genetic exchange was occurring between the two races. Pembleton and Baker (1978) studied a contact zone between races B (2N = 70, FN = 70) and C (2N = 70, 71 or 72, FN = 72) in New Mexico. They observed a low level of F 1 hybridization and reduced fertility of F 1 hybrids but were unable to draw conclusions regarding species level differentiation because of the inability to detect backcross individuals using conventional karyotypic techniques. Honeycutt and Schmidly (1979) found a contact zone between races F and G in which 41 % of all gophers karyotyped had an F by G karyotype. These data suggest extensive interbreeding, but again the amount of gene exchange could not be detennined because of the inability to detect backcross individuals. Additionally, Honeycutt and Schmidly (1979) Symhols are as follows: 0 = race E; 0 = races F and C, and hybrids F by C; I':. = hybrids E by G and E by F; 0 = samples taken from an area devoid of gophers within the study site. each race: race E, 8; race F, 4; race G, 9; hybrid F by G, 3; hybrid E by G, 1.

Modem meander belts of the river may be 3,000 to 5,000 years old (Epps, 1973) , and the presence ofrace E on the west side of the river may date from that time. Races F and G occur west of the meander scar except in the contact zone approximately 0.5 km southeast of the meander scar (Honeycutt and Schmidly, 1979; Fig. 1) . Races F and G approach the contact zone from the direction of the meander scar. Of the 42 gophers collected in the contact zone, 54.8% had a race E karyotype and only 14.4% had either a race F, race G, or hybrid F by G karyotype. These data suggest that races F and G are either inferior competitively or that they are expanding their range and invading the existing range of race E.",

If hybrids are at a selective disadvantage in the zone, then the development of premating barriers to eliminate the wasting of gametes would be expected. We found no evidence of premating barriers. Gophers in both populations (race E and races F-G) appear to inhabit similar soils, thus eliminating habitat isolation as a potential premating isolating mechanism. Other premating isolating mechanisms such as preferential mate selection do not appear to be operating. Of the 42 gophers collected in the contact zone, 31% were FI hybrids which would suggest that random mating was occurring. The absence of any detectable premating isolating mechanisms may be indicative of the recency of the contact zone.",

The virtual absence of pocket gophers in cultivated land, where the soil is continuously overturned and the food source is seasonal, was evident. Pocket gophers were taken almost entirely from either road rights-of-way or from rangeland surrounding the oxbow lake. Use of the land for crops might have severely limited the distribution of gophers in this area. One area in the contact zone was cultivated land in 1975 and abandoned pasture in 1978-1979. Ten gophers, including two E by F hybrids, were collected from this area in 1979. Only three race G individuals were collected from the same area in 1975. The dispersal of gophers into this field appears to be correlated with the change in land use.",

The present road was constructed in 1945 (Texas Department of Highways and Public Transportation).

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This study was conducted by Tucker in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the Master of Science degree in Wildlife and Fisheries Sciences at Texas A&M University. Thanks are extended to j. W. Bickham and to j. R. Gold for reviewing this manuscript. Funds for computer analyses and for transportation to the study site were provided, in part, by the Texas Agricultural Experiment Station (Mammals of Texas project No. 1977) to Schmidly. Funds for pocket gopher live traps and karyotypic supplies were provided by NSF grant DEB 77-13467 to j. W. Bickham. We are grateful to M. H. Milfordofthe Soil Science Department, Texas A&M University for the lise of his laboratory for soil analyses, to R. j. Baker of the Museum, Texas Tech University, for allowing us to examine specimens, and to J. W. Bickham for the use of his laboratory and for advice on karyotyping techniques. Thanks are also extended to the following people, all of whom helped in various stages of the research: R. L. Honeycutt, D. S. Rogers, M. D. Engstrom, j. W. Sites, and R. C. Dowler. D. C. Haefeli, A. Hubbs, and C. McKinney assisted in the collection of specimens. Thanks are also extended to T. Moelhman, the late H. Moelhman, and to D. Lightsey who granted pennission to collect specimens on their property. This paper represents contri- bution no. T A16074 of the Texas Agricultural Experiment Station. LITERATURE CITED BAKER, R.
