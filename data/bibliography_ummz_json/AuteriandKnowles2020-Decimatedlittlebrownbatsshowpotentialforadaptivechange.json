    "abstract": "the degree to which species can rapidly adapt is key to survival in the face of climatic and other anthropogenic changes. for little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus), whose populations have experienced declines of over 90% because of the introduced fungal pathogen that causes white-nose syndrome (WnS), survival of the species may ultimately depend upon its capacity for adaptive change. Here, we present evidence of selectively driven change (adaptation), despite dramatic nonadaptive genomic shifts (genetic drift) associated with population declines. We compared the genetic makeups of wild survivors versus non-survivors of WNS, and found significant shifts in allele frequencies of genes associated with regulating arousal from hibernation (GABARB1), breakdown of fats (cGMP-PK1), and vocalizations (FOXP2). Changes at these genes are suggestive of evolutionary adaptation, given that WNS causes bats to arouse with unusual frequency from hibernation, contributing to premature depletion of fat reserves. However, whether these putatively adaptive shifts in allele frequencies translate into sufficient increases in survival for the species to rebound in the face of WNS is unknown. Events that kill large portions of populations, including naturally and anthropogenically induced disasters, increasingly threaten biodiversity 1,2. Invasive species are a major trigger of these declines 3 , including invasive pathogens, against which native species can experience high mortality due to a lack of co-evolutionary defenses 4-6. Introduced fungal pathogens can be particularly dangerous-they can frequently survive in the environment for extended periods, affect a relatively broad range of hosts, and can be highly virulent 7 , thereby driving mass-mortalities of native species (e.g. amphibian chytrid 8 , snake fungal disease 9 , sea fan aspergillosis 10 , and others 11-13) as well as threatening agricultural crops 14,15 (e.g. rice blast disease 16 and Fusarium wilt in bananas 17). Although host mortalities may have little impact on fungal pathogens, the pathogens can exert incredibly strong selective pressures on their host populations 18. A pressing conservation question is whether host populations can evolve resistance or tolerance during such epidemics-a necessary first step towards preventing extinction. Strong selective pressures might theoretically lead to an evolutionary rescue effect if host populations adapt 19. However, acute events that kill off most members of a species also reduce the genetic diversity upon which natural selection can act, thereby limiting the capacity for adaptive change 20. White-nose syndrome (WNS) is a disease affecting bats, which is caused by the invasive fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans 21. This highly destructive pathogen has decimated populations of bats, with 12 North American species currently affected 22 , and some populations experiencing losses of 90-100% 23. The fungus was first inadvertently introduced to North America by humans in 2006 (in the northeastern U.S.) 24 , and is spreading across the continent, largely via infected bats 25. The exact mechanism of death is not known, but bats apparently die from secondary physiological complications (e.g. depleted fat reserves) associated with too frequent arousals from hibernation 26. Here, we conduct a genome scan to test for evidence of evolutionary changes in little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) in response to WNS. The recent expansion of the fungus into our study area in 2014 combined with the staggering impact of WNS on the local population (roughly 78%) 27 provides an opportunity to study the initial evolutionary effects of this pathogen, which continues to spread throughout the continent. Eurasian bats within the genus Myotis-in the native range of the pathogen-tolerate fungal growths with no noticeable mortality 28,29. In contrast, little brown bats were the most common bats in eastern North America prior to WNS, but due to population losses, the species has now been listed as endangered by the IUCN 30 and the federal government of Canada 31 , with a similar decision by the U.S. government pending 32. Despite large observed declines, some individuals may have greater genetic-based tolerance or resistance to the disease, raising the potential for adaptive change in little brown bats via selective forces acting on standing genetic variation. However, dramatic population losses may confound the effectiveness of selection or purge potential adaptive variants via genetic drift.",

We detected the effects of stochastic, non-adaptive genomic changes in otherwise neutral portions of the genome (genetic drift) reflective of the large numbers that have died from WNS in this species. Nevertheless, we also identified genetic changes (based on F ST -outlier analyses) that may have contributed to survival (as opposed to changes simply due to strong genetic drift), where the signature of selection can be detected by levels of genetic differentiation at a gene that exceeds background levels across the genome 34, 35 .

Quantification of the rate of evolutionary change from an inferred common ancestor showed the rate of drift is an order of magnitude higher in survivors (mean F = 0.04 \u00b1 SE 0.0001) relative to non-survivors (F = 0.006 \u00b1 0.0003), using the F-model in Structure 36, 37 . This amount of drift-induced genetic change (Fig. 2) is especially striking given that these changes have accumulated over, at most, three years (with most of our samples separated by just one year; Table S1 ), in a species that can live for well over 20 years 38, 39 and in which females typically produce one pup per year 40 .",

GABARB1 is a receptor for the neurotransmitter GABA, which is a major neural inhibitor in the brains of vertebrates, and has also long been suspected to be involved in regulating hibernation 44 . In addition to GABA, these receptors are also sensitive to histamines 45 , which similarly help regulate hibernation in mammals 46 and are released in response to tissue damage from WNS 47 . The importance of an individual's sensitivity to histamines is further hinted by PLA2G7, which regulates release of histamines from mast cells 48 . Because arousals account for 80-90% of bats' energy budget during hibernation 32 , genetic variation that contributes to even small changes in arousal frequencies could result in large differences in energy expenditures, making the difference between life and death (i.e., affecting susceptibility to Figure 2 . Stochastic drift induced genetic change. (A) PCA of survivors of WNS, with non-survivors projected onto the PC axes; PC1 explained 27% and 66% of the variance among survivors and non-survivors, respectively, and PC2 explained 13% and 6% of the variance. (B) The estimated degree of genetic drift (F, as estimated in Structure 36, 37 ) is an order of magnitude greater for survivors compared to non-survivors, as illustrated by the contrasting branch lengths from an inferred common ancestor. www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ WNS). We speculate that bats genetically predisposed to release fewer histamines, or be less prone to arousals induced by histamines, are better able to survive WNS through conservation of energy reserves.",

Specifically, FOXP2 is associated with vocalizations in other vertebrates, and echolocation in bats 52 . Because variation in calls is closely associated with the type of prey and habitat bats must navigate, echolocation is an important functional trait, and potentially adaptive shifts might be related to hunting proficiency, speed of developing foraging abilities in juvenile bats, or subtle differences in prey preferences. These could affect the type and amount of fat that bats store for hibernation. In addition to echolocations for hunting, bats also emit social calls. Sociality may influence the impact of the disease in this species 53 , and due to the importance of FOXP2 in communication, the gene has been linked to variations in social behavior in other species [54] [55] [56] . A more detailed study is needed to test these hypotheses, and there are possibly alternative unknown functions of FOXP2 in bats. Interestingly, no individuals in our dataset were heterozygous for this SNP.",

The four genes we identify had putatively adaptive alleles that were entirely absent from our non-survivors (with the exception of a single allele copy in one individual). With the much greater sampling of non-survivors (n = 29) this difference is also not due to limited sampling ( Fig. 1 ). An alternative consideration is that genetic drift, not selection, explains the elevated differentiation in what we identified as putatively adaptive alleles among the survivors. With inter-locus contrasts, the genome serves as the expected background for differentiation caused by drift (i.e., the expected variance in F ST -values in this case; Fig. 3 ). However demographic processes can inflate the variance of the distribution of F ST -values (e.g. population structure such as isolation by distance or expansion; reviewed in Hoban et al. 57 ), potentially confounding the signals of selection and drift. Although we cannot rule out a role for non-selective processes, we note that annotation of the alleles suggests that selection is involved given that the functions are consistent with an adaptive response.",

While our study does not explicitly test whether bats survive WNS via resistance versus tolerance mechanisms, and the genomic approach we used only looked at a small portion of the genome, we found putative selection acting on non-immune genes, which suggests disease tolerance 58 may be important. Specifically, the alleles we identify could assist some bats in \"holding out\" until spring, when they leave sites in which growth of the pathogen is restricted to. While infected bats do exhibit an immune response to the fungus 59 , they likely ultimately die due to secondary physiological complications linked to starvation while hibernating 26, 60 . Such tolerance in little brown bats to WNS may be important for survival in both in intraspecific 61 and interspecific 62 contexts. However, others argue that resistance is the primary mechanism of survivorship 63 . Future work is needed to resolve this question.",

There have been dramatic population declines, and low population sizes inherently make species vulnerable to further perturbations. Furthermore, the disease has only been present in North America for thirteen years at the time of this publication, and with little brown bats surviving to more than 20 years old in the wild 38, 39 it will take time to determine whether surviving remnant populations have sufficient reproductive and recruitment levels to avoid extinction or extirpation. However, the functions of the genes we identify suggest that for this species, and possibly other bats effected by WNS, conservation of summer foraging habitat-not just winter hibernation sites-may promote population recovery, given that the selective advantages underlying shifts in FOXP2 would most likely manifest when bats are echolocating and hunting, and not in the hibernation sites where the bats are confronted with the fungus (Fig. 1) . Other genes we identified are likely subject to strong selection during winter periods of infection, but could also be important year-round (cGMP-PK1, PLA2G7, and GABRB1), given their functions in cellular metabolism. With the limited representation of the genome, there may also be selective divergence in genes not studied here. Nevertheless, even without more extensive coverage of the genome, our work hints at the multifaceted nature of selection by identifying genes whose roles differ across habitats of highly seasonal environments, and are linked to both physiological and behavioral traits.",

We chose northern Michigan, USA, for our study because it represents a reasonably isolated population of little brown bats (Fig. 1A) ; WNS is present throughout our study area, and was first detected there in early 2014. We sample non-survivors from hibernation sites during the winter and survivors during the summer (when they are no longer afflicted by the pathogen). However, because the species utilizes short distance seasonal migration (typically \u2264 500 km 64 ), during warmer periods they do not roost in the same sites in which they hibernate, thus the relative geographic isolation is important for assuring that bats sampled during both seasons were from the same population. Winter hibernation sites are concentrated in the northwestern portion of our study www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ area (hibernation sites are lacking in the central and southern Michigan), and primarily consist of abandoned iron and copper mines. As a consequence, bats in our area (Fig. 1A) are isolated from other populations by two factors: the Laurentian Great Lakes and the lack of suitable subterranean hibernation sites within migration range in central and southern Michigan. The seasonal sampling of bats is necessary because WNS non-survivors can only be documented in winter areas, and disease survivors can only be identified during summer.",

Survivors (n = 9) were adult bats that had been born the previous year or earlier and thus had survived at least one hibernation period with the WNS pathogen (collected during summer s of 2016-2017, see Anthony 65 for aging methodology). Most individuals which succumb to the disease are found within the subterranean sites that afflicted species of bats rely upon in winter, and in which the fungus thrives, however some infected bats leave hibernation sites prematurely in winter in search of food or water, but quickly die due to lack of available resources and sub-freezing temperatures. Correspondingly, most non-survivors we sampled were bats found dead in or near hibernation sites during winter (collected in early 2016; n = 25; Fig. 1 ), although some tissue samples came from individuals with the pathogen that were euthanized during surveillance studies (i.e., they tested positive for the fungus; collected in early 2014; n = 4). Note that comparing survivors to this more general group of non-survivors makes tests for loci under selection more conservative, in that some of the euthanized bats categorized as non-survivors may not have died from WNS naturally. However, if non-survivors actually carried adaptive alleles, this would not produce a bias (i.e., make it more likely) to detect putatively selected alleles-in fact it would make such detection more difficult. In addition, all analyses were repeated excluding the euthanized bats to confirm the robustness the results.",

The accidental inclusion of bats which had died due to other causes would make it more difficult to detect adaptation in our analyses. To reduce disturbance to hibernating bats, dead bats were collected in conjunction with routine surveys by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) and Eastern Michigan University. Four samples were contributed by the U.S. Geological Survey National Wildlife Health Center; these bats were found during hibernation with the fungus growing on them, but were euthanized (as discussed above).

SNPs with an F ST -value of greater than nine standard deviations from the mean (mean = 0.018 \u00b1 1 SD of 0.026) were considered outliers (similar to Willoughby et al. 42 ). A threshold of five standard deviations is often used in detection of outlier SNPs under positive selection 42, 86, 87 . We increased our threshold of significance to nine standard deviations to reduce the potential for false-positives. In the second approach, confidence intervals (95% CI) were estimated using diveRsity 88 . Using the diffCalc function, Weir and Cockerham's F ST 89 was calculated for all loci, with 1,000 bootstraps performed across loci. Only loci for which the lower limit of the CI remained five SD from the mean were considered outliers. In the third approach, outliers were identified with OutFLANK 90 , which estimates the expected neutral variation of F ST -values under a chi-squared distribution. As per the developer guidelines 90 , we excluded loci with low expected heterozygosity (<0.1), and visually adjusted the trim functions to best fit the observed distribution (LeftTrimFraction = 0.3 and RightTrimFraction = 0.05; Fig. S9 ). Significance was assessed using qvalue 91 in R 74 (v. 2.12) .",
