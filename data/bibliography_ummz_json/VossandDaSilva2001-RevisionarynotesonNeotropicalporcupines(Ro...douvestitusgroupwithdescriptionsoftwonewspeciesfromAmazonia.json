                "text": "Conspicuous among the Neotropical prehensile-tailed porcupines currently referred to the genus Coendou (including Sphiggurus; Handley and Pine, 1992 ) is a group of smallbodied species whose dorsal pelage contains three intermingled but distinctly different structural types: soft fur, quills (defensive spines with hard, sharp, barbed tips), and an unusual structural type that may be called bristle-quills ( fig. 1 ). The latter are much longer and thinner than conventional quills, but have the same distinctive root morphology (described and illustrated by Chapman and Roze, 1997) , round cross section, stiff cortex, and spongy internal matrix; unlike regular quills, however, the tips of bristle-quills are attenuated, flexible, wire-like filaments, and they are not provided with microscopic barbs. Although some species of Coendou have been incorrectly described as covered by quills only (e.g., C. prehensilis, C. bicolor; Ellerman, 1940) , a sparse underfur of short wool hairs is always present among the quill bases of such forms. Other species of Coendou are superficially covered by long fur, but these taxa always possess an underlying defensive coat of sharp quills. In fact, all Coendou species possess both soft fur and quills; the distinctive feature of the species treated in this report consists in the additional presence of thin bristle-quills. Because the latter are not known to occur among any other erethizontids, the simplest explanation for their taxonomic distribution is that they evolved uniquely in the common ancestor of the group of species described below.",

The quills (ranging in length from about 25 to 35 mm middorsally) are bicolored, pale yellow or ivory-white basally and dark-brown or blackish distally; usually only the distalmost 1 \u2044\uf736 or less of each quill is dark, so the pale quill bases are exposed when the fur is parted or ruffled. None of the quills anywhere on the body is pale-tipped. Scattered abundantly but inconspicuously throughout most of the dorsal pelage are long (to 70-80 mm) polished bristle-quills that emerge from the fur like fine wires; these are yellowish basally, but the emergent tips are dark. No bristle-quills occur over the rump, however, which is clothed only by short, sharp quills and fur. The ventral surface of the body is densely covered with soft and uniformly dark-brown fur from chin to anus. Two classes of hairs can be distinguished in the ventral fur (fine, wavy wool hairs and coarser, straighter guard hairs), but there are no conspicuously thickened spinous hairs grouped in triads or other clusters.",

In addition, Thomas (1905) examined four paratypes, of which three retain original labels with Brice\u00f1o's commercial imprint: two of these are from ''Monta\u00f1a del Valle 2600 m'', and were collected on 16 November 1903 (BMNH 5.7.5.8, 5.7.5.11) ; the other is from ''Monta\u00f1as del Tabay 2600 m'', and was collected on 28 January 1904 (BMNH 5.7.5.12). The fourth paratype (BMNH 5.7.5.10) has a museum label in Thomas's hand with the locality given as ''Merida, Venezuela'', and the collection date as 14 June 1904.

Although the dorsal fur is predominantly blackish (Thomas, 1905) or dark brown, the hair tips are pale (grayish or silvery), producing a frosted effect that is more pronounced in some individuals (e.g., BMNH 10.12.3.5) than in others (e.g., BMNH 26.11.4.11) . The fur is long (50-70 mm midorsally) and dense enough to conceal most of the underlying quills except on the head. All of the body quills (30-40 mm long middorsally) are bicolored (yellowish or ivory-white basally with the extreme tips dark brown), but some of the quills on the crown of the head and on the cheeks are tricolored (with white bases and tips separated by a broad dark middle band). Scattered throughout the dorsal pelage-except over the rump-are many long (to 80-100 mm) wirelike bristle-quills, the pale (usually ivorywhite or yellowish) tips of which are conspicuous against the dark background of the fur; most of the bristle-quills are actually tricolored (with pale bases and tips separated by a single dark middle band), but some are entirely pale. The ventral body pelage consists of soft frosted-brown fur from chin to anus. Longer, straighter, coarser guard hairs can be distinguished from finer, shorter, wavy wool hairs in the ventral pelage, but there are no conspicuously thickened spinous hairs rooted in obvious clusters.",

The rostrum is short and tapering in subadults and young adults, but lengthens in older animals, some of which develop shallow lateral excavations for the infraorbital muscle. The nasal bones are approximately parallel-sided in some specimens and taper slightly posteriorly in others, but always have rounded posterior margins that extend well behind the premaxillae. Viewed from above, the zygomatic arches converge anteriorly from the squamosal roots without a well-developed secondary widening at the orbits; some specimens (e.g., FMNH 140260), however, have more rounded (less angular) zygomatic outlines than others (e.g., MCZ 18738; fig. 8 ).

Externally, pruinosus differs from vestitus by its frosted (versus unicolored-dark) dorsal and ventral fur, tricolored (versus bicolored) head quills, pale-tipped (versus dark-tipped) bristle-quills, and chevron of pale-tipped caudal bristles (versus caudal chevron absent). Cranially, the two species are clearly distinguishable by palatal morphology (the bony palate between the toothrows is more distinctly ridged and grooved in vestitus than in pruinosus), mesopterygoid perforation (distinct sphenopalatine vacuities are present in vestitus versus absent in pruinosus), alisphenoid ossification (the sphenopterygoid canal is laterally open in vestitus versus closed in pruinosus), and mandibular morphology (a distinct coronoid process is absent in vestitus but present in pruinosus). In addition, other modal differences support the hypothesis that these are genetically differentiated taxa: (1) rostral morphology (the sides of the rostrum appear to be more deeply excavated for the origin of the infraorbital muscle in vestitus than in like-aged pruinosus); (2) depth of the jugal (more dorsoventrally expanded below the orbit in pruinosus than in vestitus); (3) morphology of the incisive foramina (short, incompletely separated, and contained entirely by the premaxillae in most vestitus versus longer, completely separated, and bordered by the maxillae in most pruinosus); and (4) depth of the mesopterygoid fossa (penetrating to or between the second molars in vestitus versus shallower in most pruinosus). Although only small samples are currently available for taxonomic comparisons, these differences permit unambiguous identifications and seem more than sufficient to recognize C. vestitus and C. pruinosus as valid species.",

Nevertheless, a few specimens from geographically peripheral localities are notably atypical. In particular, AMNH 136312 (from the foothills of the Cordillera Oriental in Departamento Meta, Colombia) has unusually sparse fur, a deep mesopterygoid fossa (extending between the second molars), and small toothrows (MTR, 13.3 mm); its bullae are relatively longer (approaching the base of the paroccipital process on each side) and more laterally compressed than those seen in topotypical material. Likewise, MHNLS 7692 (from the foothills of the Serran\u00eda de Perij\u00e1) has uniquely swollen frontal sinuses, dorsal bristles tipped with pale orange (instead of white or pale yellow), and very large bullae. Finally, the single specimen examined from the Cordillera de la Costa (BMNH 26.11.4.11, a subadult) has unusually short incisive foramina, small teeth, and large bullae. The possibility that such outliers represent distinct taxa merits testing when more material becomes available from these areas.",

DESCRIPTION: External-No soft fur is apparent in the dorsal pelage except by close examination because the blackish wool hairs are sparse and hidden among the quills and bristles; a few dorsal wool hairs plucked from two specimens were about 40 mm in length. All of the quills (30-40 mm long middorsally) are bicolored (yellowish basally with the terminal \u2153 to \u00bd dark-brown or 3 The original specimen label gives the locality as ''Rio Pastaza'' only, but the entire von Baumann-Roosevelt collection (including 10 other mammals and 25 birds variously labeled ''Rio Tigre'', ''Rio Bobonaza'', Rio Blanco'', ''Rio Pastaza'', and ''Rio Napo'') was known to have been obtained in Ecuador, so the lower (Peruvian) course of this river can be ruled out. Unfortunately, the exact route traveled by the von Baumann-Roosevelt Expedition is unknown, and no archival record of the purpose or staffing of this mysterious outfit appears to exist. Filed correspondence with its director, Cyril von Baumann, consists only of an AMNH accessions receipt dated 23 January 1937, together with a curt acknowledgment from von Baumann dated 1 February. blackish), except on the head, where some quills are tricolored (with ivory-white bases and tips separated by a dark middle band). Densely scattered among the quills are many long (to ca. 80 mm) thin bristle-quills with yellowish bases and tips separated by a broad dark-brown or blackish middle band; the pale tips of the bristle-quills produce a character-istically streaked effect over the whole dorsum with the exception of the rump (which is covered only with short bicolored quills and a few wool hairs). The ventral body pelage consists of very coarse bicolored or tricolored hairs (ca. 0.30-0.40 mm in diameter and 15 mm long) that are usually rooted in triplets but occasionally in groups of two or NO. 3351 AMERICAN MUSEUM NOVITATES four; a few short wool hairs are almost invisibly scattered among this harsh covering.",

Externally, roosmalenorum resembles vestitus and pruinosus by its long, dense dorsal fur and nonspinous ventral pelage, but it differs from both of those species in details of fur coloration (grayish or brownish versus blackish), in body size (much smaller, as indicated by hindfoot measurements), and by its conspicuously longer tail. Other external characters provide different patterns of taxonomic contrasts. Like vestitus, roosmalenorum has only bicolored cranial quills, whereas at least some cranial quills are tricolored in all examined specimens of pruinosus. Like pruinosus, however, roosmalenorum has tricolored bristle-quills, whereas the bristle-quills of vestitus are bicolored. In craniodental traits, roosmalenorum differs from vestitus in palatal sculpturing, alisphenoid ossification, bullar size, mandibular morphology, and in many additional (but subtler) details. From pruinosus, roosmalenorum differs craniodentally by its relatively much larger bullae, but other osteological contrasts between these taxa are harder to assess due to the wide range of var-iation among referred specimens. For example, the contrast in rostral morphology between some exemplar crania of pruinosus (e.g., MCZ 18738; fig. 8 ) and roosmalenorum (e.g., INPA 2586; fig. 14) is striking, but other specimens that we could have chosen to represent each species (e.g., FMNH 140260 [pruinosus] and INPA 677 [roosmalenorum] ) are much more similar in this character. Average (or modal) character differences between roosmalenorum and pruinosus, however, include dental size (roosmalenorum has smaller molars), mesopterygoid penetration between the toothrows (deeper in roosmalenorum), mesopterygoid fenestration (sphenopalatine vacuities are better developed in roosmalenorum), and nasal/frontal sinus inflation (perhaps more frequent in roosmalenorum).",

Other trenchant external differences include size (roosmalenorum is smaller, as evidenced by hindfoot measurements), and ventral pelage composition (coarse banded hairs in ichillus, woollier in roosmalenorum). The sum of such contrasts is sufficiently striking that it is unlikely that these species could be confused in the field by competent observers. By contrast, cranial differences between roosmalenorum and ichillus are harder to identify given the small samples at hand. Although it is possible that the morphology of the nasal/frontal sinuses (perhaps more frequently inflated in roosmalenorum), zygomatic arches (perhaps more rounded in ichillus), and the mesopterygoid roof (perhaps more frequently fenestrated in roosmalenorum) might have some diagnostic value alone or in combination, larger samples are clearly needed to assess such modal differences.",

Although certain differences observed in our material are plausibly attributable to ontogeny, others are not.

Kept alive as a pet, the animal was released every evening to roam freely in the surrounding terra firme forest, returning at dawn to sleep throughout the day in a box underneath its owners' house. This individual subsequently lived for several months in captivity at Manaus, where it maintained its nocturnal habits (sleeping in a tree hole by day), and ate a variety of seeds and fruit. It died of unknown causes while seeming perfectly healthy.",

(1996) as the ''Black dwarf porcupine'' of Emmons (1990: 199) , a taxon that is technically known as Coendou nycthemera Olfers (see Voss and Angermann [1997] , who explain that C. koopmani Handley and Pine is a junior synonym). One of those specimens (the female, INPA 677) is a paratype of C. roosmalenorum, but the whereabouts of the two male specimens is unknown. It is difficult to understand how INPA 677 could possibly have been mistaken for Emmons' black dwarf porcupine, which was clearly described by her as having entirely spiny blackish upperparts. One possible explanation is that the two missing specimens from Naiff's series were, in fact, C. nycthemera (which is known to occur on the right bank of the lower Madeira near Borba), and that INPA 677 was mistaken for a conspecific long-furred juvenile. Whether or not this conjecture is correct, future collectors should be alert to the possibility that two small species of Coendou may be sympatrically or parapatrically distributed along the right (east) bank of the Madeira.",

The small species of southeastern Amazonia is C. nycthemera, previously known by its junior synonym C. koopmani (see Voss and Angermann, 1997) .

Because Balta is far from the known range of both C. ichillus and C. roosmalenorum, it is not surprising that the small porcupine described by the Cashinahua is clearly not referable to either taxon (A. L. Gardner, personal commun.).",
