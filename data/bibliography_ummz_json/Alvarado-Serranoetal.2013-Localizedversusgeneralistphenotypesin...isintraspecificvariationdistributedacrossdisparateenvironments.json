    "abstract": "Background: The extent of phenotypic differentiation in response to local environmental conditions is a key component of species adaptation and persistence. Understanding the structuring of phenotypic diversity in response to local environmental pressures can provide important insights into species evolutionary dynamics and responses to environmental change. This work examines the influence of steep environmental gradients on intraspecific phenotypic variation and tests two hypotheses about how the tropical soft grass mouse, Akodon mollis (Cricetidae, Rodentia), contends with the disparate environmental conditions encompassed by its broad distribution. Specifically, we test if the species expresses a geographically unstructured, or generalist, phenotype throughout its range or if it shows geographically localized morphological differentiation across disparate environments. Results: Using geometric morphometric and ecomorphological analyses of skull shape variation we found that despite distinct environmental conditions, geographically structured morphological variation is limited, with the notable exception of a distinct morphological disjunction at the high-elevation forest-grassland transition in the southern portion of A. mollis distribution. Based on genetic analyses, geographic isolation alone does not explain this localized phenotype, given that similar levels of genetic differentiation were also observed among individuals inhabiting other ecosystems that are nonetheless not distinct morphologically. Conclusions: Instead of phenotypic specialization across environments in these tropical mountains, there was limited differentiation of skull shape and size across the broad range of A. mollis, with the exception of individuals from the puna, the highest-elevation ecosystem. The high morphological variance among individuals, together with a weak association with local environmental conditions, not only highlights the flexibility of A. mollis' skull, but also highlights the need for further study to understand what maintains the observed morphological patterns. The work also indicates that mechanisms other than processes linked to local ecological specialization as a driver of diversification may contribute to the high diversity of this tropical region.",

For example, across species there is a negative correlation between body size and environmental temperature (Bergmann's rule [4] ) and an association in mammals between precipitation and high degree of hypsodonty in species inhabiting arid and grassy regions [5, 6] . However, localized phenotypes may not necessarily be observed within a species, even if populations occur across steep environmental gradients and disparate ecosystems. Depending on the relative fitness trade-offs between alternative phenotypes, degree of population isolation, and the constancy and/or spatial heterogeneity of the environment [7] [8] [9] , a geographically unstructured, generalist phenotype may be expressed throughout the species' range that is capable of thriving in a wide variety of conditions.",

Temperature, air pressure, solar radiation, precipitation, area, cloud cover, soil quality, and productivity change considerably with elevation [12, 13] . As a consequence, tropical mountains are characterized by a wide array of habitats with a highly patchy distribution given the high topographic heterogeneity of these mountains [11, 13] . Such disparity in environmental conditions, together with the temporal environmental stability of tropical mountains is expected to promote specialization to local conditions [14, 15] , and hence, the expression of local phenotypes. Such a mechanism might promote speciation, generating the hyperdiversity observed in tropical mountains. However, other factors might counter the prevalence of local phenotypes. For example, depending on the degree of population connectivity across ecosystems and the extent of climate-induced distributional shifts associated with paleoclimatic conditions (e.g., [16] ), a generalist phenotype strategy might be favored [8, 17, 18] .",

                "text": "Here we explicitly test for the existence of local phenotypes in the soft grass mouse, Akodon mollis, a tropical species with a widespread distribution that makes it ideal for examining how phenotypic variability is structured in taxa facing disparate environmental conditions that are relevant to exploring what evolutionary strategies might be used by taxa to cope with the steep environmental gradients of tropical mountains. This species ranges from approximately 500 to 5500 m in the Andes of Ecuador and northwestern Peru [19] , across disparate habitats and steep ecological transitions such as the one between the tree-dominated Andean slopes and the grassland-dominated highlands (Figure 1 ). In contrast to many tropical Andean rodents that are acknowledged to be fairly specialized [20] [21] [22] , the few ecological studies on this species suggest A. mollis is a widespread and an abundant generalist with relatively limited individual dispersal capabilities relative to other small terrestrial mammals [21, 23, 24] . Its diet is comprised of varying proportions of plant and insect material, like other species of the genus [21, 23] . Yet, it remains unknown how A. mollis thrives in the broad range of environmental conditions encompassed by its distributional range, which is much broader than that of its close relatives [19, 23] . Specifically, its distribution might reflect a wide tolerance owing to a geographically unstructured, generalist phenotype that is adapted to a broad range of conditions (hereafter, generalist phenotype strategy). Alternatively, the species may be characterized by local phenotypes, product of plasticity or local adaptation to local environmental conditions (hereafter, localized phenotype strategy). To investigate this issue, we focus on skull morphological variation because of its fundamental role in food processing and perceiving sensory information that allows vertebrates to interact with its environment [25] , as evidenced by environmentally induced morphological changes in mice skulls [25, 26] . For example, functional links between skull variation and environmental differences have been demonstrated by studies on the biomechanics of mastication under different diets [27, 28] or differing selective regimes [29, 30] . In particular, differentiation across disparate environments might be evident in areas of the skull that serve for muscle attachment (e.g., zygomatic arches [31] ), influence bite force (e.g., rostrum [32] ), or have been shown to covary with environmental gradients (e.g., the auditory bullae with aridity [27] , or the palatal region with temperature [33] ). Morphological differentiation across environments might also arise as an indirect effect of changes in performance under different conditions (e.g., increased energy available for investment in growth [34] ).",

A between group-PCA (BG-PCA [46] ), in which shape data averaged by ecosystem were used to construct the principal axes onto which individuals were then projected, was also conducted. This analysis shows similar, but more limited, patterns of morphological differentiation of puna individuals, as can be seen in a plot of the first and second BG-PCA axes for the size-corrected and uncorrected shape data (Figure 2b, c) , which together account for around 70% of the between-group variance in both analyses (surprisingly this pattern of differentiation is more evident in the size-corrected data than in the uncorrected data; see results and discussion below). It is important to note that similar levels of morphological differentiation of the high-elevation puna individuals was observed when the BG-PCA axes were constructed based on elevation groups, as opposed to ecosystems (results not shown), which suggests the results are not an artifact of the a priori groupings used.",

                "text": "To statistically explore the degree of morphological and environmental covariation PLS analyses were conducted (note the BG-PCA, used above, is a graphical technique; see Methods for details). Population averages were used in these and the SEVM analyses (see below) because of unequal sampling across ecosystems (Table 1) , which reflects natural differences in the abundance of A. mollis [23] , but may nonetheless compromise statistical analyses based on individuals (no formal disparity analysis was feasible given the sample size differences across populations). The results of these analyses show that although size and shape variation significantly covaries with environment On the central-north and southeast Peruvian Andes the abrupt transition between forested and non-forested habitats occurs when the humid Andean cloud forest is replaced by an elfin forest [10, 35] , which itself is replaced at higher elevations by grasslands called p\u00e1ramos. These grasslands are characterized by high atmospheric humidity, high rainfall, and a continuous layer of short vegetation, dwarf shrubs, and wetlands [36] [37] [38] . On the central-south and southwest Peruvian Andes, this abrupt transition occurs between the xeric habitats characteristic of this region and a short forest dominated by quenoa trees (Polylepis spp.), which is then replaced by puna at higher elevations [39] . The puna ecosystem corresponds to steppes of isolated grasses and shrubs, low productivity, and an annual precipitation markedly seasonal and lower than that of the p\u00e1ramo [40] [41] [42] . (RV coefficient = 0.15, 0.31, and 0.30 with p-value = 0.02, < 0.01, and < 0.01 for size, uncorrected shape, and sizecorrected shape, respectively), the amount of morphological and environmental variance contained within the PLS axes is limited. In fact, less than 7% of the environmental variance was explained in the PLS analysis of size (Figure 3a) , which is the primary phenotypic feature that distinguishes the individuals from the puna from those of other ecosystems (Figure 2 ). Moreover, in none of the analyses of shape data did the first two PLS axes explain more than 36% or 18% of the morphological and environmental variance, respectively (Figure 3b, c) . A scatterplot of the first set of PLS components of the size analysis shows that the association of skull size with environment is mainly driven by the smaller size of the majority of puna individuals (the single PLS of morphology in this analysis is negatively associated with skull size) ( Figure 3a) . In contrast, scatterplots of the shape data for the first 2 sets of components show a linear pattern of covariation between morphological and environmental variation (Figure 3b , c). In this latter analyses, the first morphological PLS axis, which is significantly correlated with latitude (Pearson's r = 0.42, p-value = 0.007), mostly reflects differences in the volume of the braincase ( Figure 3d ) and presents no obvious association with ecosystem. The second morphological PLS axis separates populations according to elevation (Pearson's r = \u22120.55, p-value < 0.001) by differences associated with multiple regions of the skull that affect both the breadth of the braincase and the length of the rostrum (Figure 3d ). The morphological distinctiveness of puna populations does not correspond to latitudinal environmental variation (see below for a discussion of the contribution of spatial and genetic isolation to the distinctiveness of the puna phenotype), but instead to differentiation of mid-and high-elevation habitats (Figure 3c ). It is important to note that the fact that puna individuals appear as partially distinct only in the second set of PLS axes is not necessarily unusual because PLS axes are not expected to capture the main axis of morphological differentiation given that they do not maximize the within block variance [47, 48] .",

This relationship is robust after Skull size and shape variability in A. mollis. Scatterplots of all sampled individuals according to their centroid size (a) and their scores on the first two between-groups principal components (BG-PCA) of uncorrected (b) and size-corrected shape (c) (see Methods for details). Individuals from the highest ecosystem (i.e., Central Andean wet puna) are surrounded by a minimum convex hull to facilitate comparison between scatterplots. In addition, in order to illustrate the amount of intrapopulation variance, the position of individuals from two arbitrarily selected populations are highlighted in blue and red (populations 9 and 14, respectively; see Appendix) as an example in an inset in each plot. Symbols are based on two proxies of environmental variation, the elevation and ecosystem (abbreviations as in Figure 1 ) in which each specimen was sampled.

Scatterplots of the single set of PLS axes for the analysis on size (a), and the first (b) and second (c) set of PLS axes for the analysis on uncorrected shape (results for the size-corrected shape data were similar; not shown). Although PLS analyses were run on population-averaged data, the extent of local intra-population variability is depicted as vertical lines below and above each population score, with the line lengths determined by the minimum and maximum individual scores obtained for each population when all individuals are projected onto each morphological PLS component.

These findings suggest that A. mollis' skull morphological variation related to local environmental conditions have a significant, but limited, effect on overall skull shape and size. The primary exception to what appears to be a geographically unstructured generalist phenotype is the high-elevation puna Andean ecosystem in the southern portion of A. mollis distribution. This group of individuals is consistently morphologically distinct from individuals from the other ecosystems across the majority of analysesit even differs from populations from similar elevations but different ecosystem (i.e., p\u00e1ramo; Figure 2 ). Taken together, these results suggest that the skull of this species fits neither a strict generalist phenotype strategy (i.e., a geographically unstructured phenotype throughout its range) nor a strict localized phenotype strategy (i.e., different local phenotypes).",

                "text": "have been shown to experience significant and rapid morphological changes in response to changes in temperature, precipitation, and human population density over the last 100 years [56] . The weak environment-morphology association is not attributable to a general lack of morphological or genetic variation ( Figure 5 , see also Additional file 2). To the contrary, the species is characterized by substantial morphological variability (even if we exclude the differences between puna and the other populations, Figures 2 and  3 ; also see [23, 57, 58] ) and genetic variation, with relatively large average pairwise sequence divergence between individuals (5.6 \u00b1 4.9% for all data, and 4.83 \u00b1 5.41% when puna individuals are excluded, Additional file 2). In contrast to other mice with broad geographic ranges that do show localized morphological differentiation (e.g., [25, 33] ), the observed variation among individuals within populations suggests that the absence of local specialization may result from a relaxed association in A. mollis between skull morphology and ecological performance (cf. [59] ) (i.e., relaxed selection), especially considering that the variation is present irrespective of whether individuals experience similar biotic and abiotic conditions (i.e., occur at the same locality). Under this hypothesis, environmental canalization of skull morphology would be relaxed due to weakened effective selection against alternative phenotypes, possibly because of small effective population size or by recent or frequent environmental changes [60] , for instance, due to humaninduced landscape changes or natural climatic events. Alternatively, the variability might reflect a general ecological plasticity in the species [21, 23] , which might be favored to increase the species' ecological breadth [17] . In this case, the observed morphological variation among coexisting individuals could reflect a strategy to reduce intraspecific competition under high local abundances (typical of A. mollis) and maintain high adaptability potential [61, 62] , as suggested for some other generalist vertebrate species [63, 64] , including some species of mice [65] . Under this latter scenario, the microhabitat experienced by an individual throughout development may be more important in determining skull variation in ecological-plastic species than macroenvironmental conditions (i.e., the differences in habitat that is captured by the coarse-grained variables used here). Individual variation under this scenario could arise for instance from variation in individuals' diet, as have been observed in feeding trials in deer mice [26] . Testing of these alternatives (and at this point, speculative scenarios) requires detailed eco-morphological studies of multiple cohorts through time, and hence, goes beyond this contribution. Nevertheless, future studies on this topic might significantly add to our understanding of the role that environment plays in morphological evolution and ecological specialization. ",

The progressive disappearance of tree coverage at high elevations diminishes the buffering effect of vegetation on microclimatic conditions [67, 68] . Consequently, the physical conditions organisms have to cope with at high tropical elevations become harsher as average temperatures, atmospheric pressure, atmospheric concentration of oxygen, and water vapor pressure decrease, and daily temperature fluctuations and physiological aridity increase [40, 67, 69] . Although similar challenges are experienced by individuals inhabiting high-elevation p\u00e1ramo environments, the more arid conditions of the puna ecosystem ( [36, 41] ) and the average higher and more southern location of puna populations, may exacerbate the cold-desertification and hypoxia effects of high elevation environments. In line with this hypothesis, the first and second environmental PLS axes in the size and shape analyses, respectively, along which puna populations are the most different (Figure 3c ), are strongly associated with the first environmental principal component, which in turn is highly correlated with precipitation variables (Table 2 ; Additional file 3).",

This possibility seems feasible when considering that a previous study of the diet of other species of Akodon in southwestern Peru revealed a significant relationship between the proportion of insects in the diet and elevation [72] . Furthermore, similar changes in diet and associated morphological traits with elevation have also been observed in other cricetid mice [69, 73] . Thus, it is certainly plausible (although purely speculative at this point) that such interactions between direct physiological constraints imposed by the challenging environmental conditions of tropical highlands and indirect pressures imposed by dietary constraints might be partially responsible for the differences in skull morphology observed in the high-elevation populations of A. mollis, as in cricetid mice [25, 26] .",

As seen in other systems, where steep ecological transitions are present, genetic isolation and strong phenotypic differences can arise and be maintained even between populations in close proximity [74] [75] [76] . Our preliminary exploration of levels of population genetic differentiation seems to partially support this possibility. However, unexplained patterns of genetic variation suggest that this alone cannot explain the morphological distinctiveness of puna populations. For example, the average cytochrome-b pairwise nucleotide differences between the populations for which we have genetic data showed that both puna and some high-elevation p\u00e1ramo populations differed markedly from the rest of populations (Additional 2). Moreover, these high-elevation p\u00e1ramo populations are genetically distinct from populations that are geographically proximate to them (and more so than the puna populations are from the other populations) (Figure 5b ). Yet, unlike the puna individuals, there is only limited morphological differentiation between these high-elevation p\u00e1ramo populations and all other populations. These observations make it unlikely that the morphological distinction of puna individuals is exclusively driven by their degree of genetic isolation. Still, this question deserves further exploration given the claim that A. mollis may be a species complex has been made, albeit based on limited sampling [24] .",

One possibility is that divergence of the puna populations reflects the interplay of stochastic and deterministic factors. For example, recent work demonstrates how species divergence may reflect an interaction of past demographic conditions (including the stochastic effects associated with changes in population size) that accompanies climate-induced distributional shifts and the ecological attributes of species (including whether the taxon tracks shifts in their habitat and whether they are spatially restricted owing to particular habitat affinities) [16] . Hypothetically, for instance, if puna populations have been unable to migrate out of the puna due to its environmental isolation, it is plausible that they have been forced into a more specialized morphology due to the marked cycles of aridification this ecosystem experienced during the Pleistocene [78] . Additional studies that specifically address the origin and phylogenetic relationships of these genetically distinct populations are required before a more definitive conclusion about the validity of this hypothesis is reached.",

                "text": "Even though high levels of ecological specialization has been proposed as a principal mechanism for generating tropical diversity [14, 15] , the ecomorphological analyses suggest that morphological specialization in the skull of A. mollis is limited, except for the localized phenotype of individuals from the puna. This finding suggests that A. mollis' skull does not fit either a strict generalist or localized phenotype strategy, but a mix of the two, with limited geographically structured morphological variation thorough most of its broad geographic range. Together these results offer insights into the processes that generate and maintain diversity in the tropical Andes, a region that has been previously proposed to be an important center of differentiation and diversification [79] [80] [81] . Aside from the morphological disjunction identified between puna populations and the rest of populations, the lack of consistent and strong morphological differentiation across environments, and wide geographic range of A. mollis suggest that additional mechanisms of diversification in tropical systems may deserve more attention than they have received. The geographic structure of phenotypic variation in the skull of A. mollis may be exceptional considering that other morphological structures of this species have not been studied in A. mollis and the wide ecological tolerance of this mouse compared to other tropical species. Nevertheless, with these caveats in mind (as well as those regarding the interpretation of results given the small sample sizes of some populations) our results also have important implications for understanding biological resilience to environmental change in tropical mountains. Specifically, even though tropical mountain habitats are predicted to be disproportionally susceptible to ongoing environmental changes [82, 83] , the apparent adaptability of A. mollis suggest that it may be able to accommodate a broad range of conditions, and hence, be more resilient. Future studies that assess the generality of these findings and explore its mechanistic basis are expected to further advance our understanding of morphological evolution in one of the most diverse ecosystems on Earth.

Given the taxonomic complexity of the genus [58, 85, 86] , and the poorly defined diagnosis available for A. mollis, we based our taxonomic identification of specimens on a combination of external and internal morphological characters (e.g., a robust braincase, short rostrum, zygomatic plate broad and not inclined [24, 57, 87, 88] ). Only adult specimens were used to minimize the effects of ontogenetic differences [24, 89] . Adults were defined as individuals with all three molars completely erupted and with the posteroloph in the third molar eroded (which corresponds to ages 3 to 5 [90] ). Sex and locality information was recorded for all 153 specimens from skin tags and collectors field notes. When available, the locality's latitude and longitude was also recorded. Otherwise, specimens were georeferenced based on the collector's notes following a point-radius method [91] . We assessed the confidence of our georeferencing by contrasting the elevation given in the field and museum notes with one we obtained from a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM [92] ) based on the coordinates estimated.",

Because of the resolution of the ecogeographical data (climatic data: 1 km 2 , vegetation cover and productivity: 0.25 km 2 , and elevation: 0.02 km 2 ), localities in close proximity (i.e., less than 1 km apart) were treated as a single locality, resulting in 40 unique localities (see Appendix).

After sequencing, these fragments were cleaned in Sequencher v4.6 [99] and aligned in MacClade v4 [100] . A haplotype frequency matrix was extracted from the aligned sequences and used in a PCA on the covariance matrix (for details see [101] ). Individuals' scores on the first three principal components, which together accounted for 71.66% of the genetic variance, were averaged by population and used to control for the effect of genetic distance in the spatial regressions (see below). In addition, and in light of the ecomorphological results, we performed an Isolation By Distance analysis (IBD, [102] ) using Mantel tests [103] based on 10000 permutations to assess the spatial structure of the morphological and genetic data.",

After superimposition, we searched for outliers in the dataset (i.e., individuals with landmarks that strongly deviate from the mean shape); outlier individuals were redigitized to assure they were not the product of digitizing error. We then used the vetted superimposed data to estimate size and shape skull components. Skull size was quantified as the centroid size of the superimposed landmark configuration, calculated as the square root of the sum of all squared distances between each landmark and the configuration centroid [43] . To minimize departure from normality, the log e -transformed centroid size was used in all analyses. Skull shape was quantified using the symmetric component of the morphological variation to avoid redundancy and to control for assymmetric differences in the skull [44] . Specifically, skull shape was quantified by all non-zero variance components of a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the covariance matrix of the symmetric coordinates.",

Uncorrected and size-corrected skull shape variation was visually assessed using between-groups PCA (BG-PCA, [46] ), which is a modification of the most-commonlyused PCA that takes into account a priori individual grouping by identifying PCs from the variancecovariance matrix of group mean shapes and then projecting all individuals into these components [110] . We chose this approach as it represents a compromise between a PCA, which is a suboptimal analyses for revealing group differentiation, and a Canonical Variate Analysis or Discriminant Analysis, which is prone to over-identify group differences [110] . Specifically, we constructed BG-PCA axes using the ecosystem in which individuals were collected.",

In the case of shape data, we chose to average the scores of the uncorrected and size-corrected shape PCAs run on individuals (see details above) instead of averaging the landmark coordinates by population first and then running PCAs on the averaged data to avoid maximizing differences between populations. All analyses hereafter were performed on the population-averaged size and shape components. To explore the association between environmental conditions and morphological variation we performed 3 independent two-block Partial Least Squares analyses (PLS). We chose this method because it is robust to the underlying structure of the data as it does not rely on a particular variable model [48] . The first two PLS analyses were based on the averaged-bypopulation PC scores of all non-zero-variance PCs from either uncorrected or size-corrected data (as one block) and the first 10 principal components of the standardized environmental data (as another block, see Data acquisition section), which together accounted for 99.91% of the environmental variance. We also performed a third PLS analysis between averaged log e centroid size and the same 10 principal components of the environmental data. In all three cases we summarized the overall strength of the association using the RV coefficient, which is a multivariate statistic analog to the squared correlation and ranges from 0 (uncorrelated) to 1 (completely correlated) [106, 111, 112] .",

We chose SEVM because it has been shown to minimize spatial autocorrelation more efficiently than other techniques [50] . Using this spatially-explicit technique we performed a regression of the log e -transformed centroid size onto the first three principal components of the environmental data, which together accounted for 87.66% of the environmental variance, in SAM [113] -we chose 3 instead of 10 environmental components to minimize the risk of overfitting given our sample size. We then repeated these analyses on the population-averaged scores of all the non-zero-variance principal components of the uncorrected and size-corrected data. We combined the results of these regressions, separately for the uncorrected and size-corrected data, by adding the amount of variance explained by the SEVM regression on each component, weighted by the corresponding proportion of variance explained by each principal component. Finally, for the subset of our sample of populations for which we had genetic data (22 of 40 populations), we ran additional SEVM regressions that include the same first three principal components of the environmental data and additionally the first three principal components of the genetic data as predictors (see Data Acquisition section). For all SEVM analyses we used the automatic selection procedure of SAM to estimate the truncation distance and the spatial filters to use. We verified the effectiveness of these procedures by analyzing the degree of spatial autocorrelation of the regressions' residuals using Moran's I correlograms. Unless otherwise noted, all analyses were run in MorphoJ [106] .",
