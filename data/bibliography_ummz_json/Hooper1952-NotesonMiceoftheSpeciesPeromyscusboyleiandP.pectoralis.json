Ser., 12: 253, 1937 ) listed a series of specimens under the name \"Peromyscus boylii levipes.\" Actually two forms are represented in that series. Fourteen of the 35 specimens are referable to P. boylei. They are from La Vegonia mine, 2900 feet elevation, at the lower edge of the pine belt. The remaining 21 examples exhibit morphological traits of P. pectoralis, although they average much larger than examples of any known race of that species. The specimens are from collecting stations in the Sierra as follows: Tamaulipeca Ranch, 1500 feet elevation; Marmolejo, 1700 feet; San Jose, 2000 feet; and La Vegonia mine, 2900 feet. Nineteen of the 21 specimens are from Tamaulipeca, Marmolejo, and San Jose. These three localities are situated on brush-covered foothills below the pine belt. Field notes indicate that the form represented by these specimens was common on rocky slopes covered with lechuguilla, maguey, and low brush. It was less abundant or absent in the oak and pine belts higher in the Sierra. P. boylei, on the other hand, was common at La Vegonia mine and apparently was absent at the stations on the foothills. It should be noted that both species occur at La Vegonia.",

In Tamaulipas it lives in a vegetational belt that is situated altitudinally below oak and pine forests and above the generally open and short vegetation of the coastal plains. This foothills belt is characterized by tall, thorny shrubs (Dice, op. cit.). Trapping records suggest that the form is more common in fairly open situations than in dense thickets. Specimens from the Sierra San Carlos were collected in the following situations: At San Jose, on limestone slopes covered with lcchuguilla (Agave lechuguilla), maguey (Agave sp.) and low brush; among granjeno (Celtis pallida), other thorny shrubs and prickly.pear (Opuntia sp.). At Tamauli-peeR, in a limestone outcrop covered with lechuguilla; in a thicket of cenizo (Leucophyllum texanum) and thorny shrubs. In the lower part of the oak zone at La Vegonia. mine, P. pectoralis was uncommon while P. boylei was abundant. P. boylei was not found at any other collecting station in the Sierra San Carlos, or if so, no specimens were preserved.

Six specimens from Santa Catarina are distinctly paler dorsally than those from Monterrey; their tarsi are also paler.

Early in the study it was evident that both forms represented in the series from the Sierra San Carlos belong in the P. boylei group, as the group is outlined by Osgood (N. Amer. Fauna, 28, 1909) . It was equally clear that diagnostic characters of P. pectoralis are to be seen in the series of collinus, while the characters of the other form are predominantly those of P. boylei. Body and cranial size, however, did not seem to fit with the other characters. Length of body and, especially, of cranium in the samples of collinus greatly exceed those in the sample of P. boylei. Such a size relationship does not obtain in any other area where both species are found, to my knowledge. In other parts of their ranges where the two species are sympatric, pectoralis is always the smaller of the two. Moreover, on the highlands of central Mexico, at least, the differences between P. boylei and P. pectoralis in cranial length and in body length are roughly equivalent to the differences in size between the two forms in the Sierra San Carlos. But in the Sierra San Carlos the form that is otherwise like P. pectoralis is larger, rather than smaller, than the race of P. boylei. This apparent reversal in size relationships made it essential that the samples from the Sierra be compared in detail with samples of P. boylei and P. pectoralis from other parts of their ranges.",

                "text": "The procedure in preparing the ratio diagram shown as Figure 1 is as follows: Six measureable, diagnostic variants were selected. A mean was calculated for each variant of each sample. The samples consist of six series of P. boylei from various parts of the range of the species, of series of P. pectoralis from three different localities, and of the sample of collinus from the Sierra San Carlos. The means were converted to logarithms. The logs of the six means for the sample of P. boylei lwipes from Amoles, Queretaro, were then plotted in a vertical line on graph paper. The vertical line represents zero difference on a horizontal scale along which positive and negative differences are indicated to three decimal places. The points on the vertical line represent the standard to which other samples are related. The amount that the log of each measurement differs from the Amoles sample was then plotted. Finally, for each variant, means of the five samples of P. boylei, excluding the standard series, and means of the three series of P. pectoralis, excluding the sample of collinus, were calculated and the differences between their logs and the standard were determined and plotted. Lines connecting those plotted points indicate sample estimates of proportions obtaining in each species. The samples and number of specimens employed in In Figure 1 each series of P. boylei resembles the standard series, also a sample of P. boylei. Their proportions cluster about the standard, faIling approximately in a vertical line near it. The proportions of the series of pectoralis likewise are similar to one another, but they are dissimilar to those of boylei. Theirpoints on the diagram are closely aligned, but they lie on a diagonal line rather than on a vertical line. It is clear that with respect to boylei, pectoralis has more caudal scales per centimeter, is similar to boylei in length of tail and length of posterior part of the cranium, but has a shorter cranium, smaller zygomatic diameter, shorter rostrum, and shorter molar row. In addition, pectoralis has a shorter cranium, relative to tail length and to number of caudal scales, than does boylei, but the cranium is about the same length relative to zygomatic breadth; the rostrum is shorter relative to length of the posterior part of the cranium, to greatest length of cranium, and to zygomatic breadth, but is longer relative to length of molar row. Other differences in proportions between the species are indicated in the graph.",

It pertains to populations of the P. boylei group of species in western Texas. The University of Michigan Museum of Zoology contains 58 specimens of this species group from the Chisos and Davis mountains. In the years that they have been on deposit in the Museum some of those specimens at various times have been labeled and relabeled Peromyscus boylei rowleyi or P. pectoralis laceianus. I wanted to know the correct identity of those specimens. Ratio diagrams were prepared for them. The results were confusing. Instead of the clear-cut patterns, one of boylei and another of pectoralis, as seen in Figure 1, points are intermixed, with little indication that two species with proportions as in Figure 1 are represented. Some of the specimens clearly resemble boylei in one or two variates, but they are proportioned as in pectoralis in other characters. Other examples are intermediate in one or more of the variates.",

These were divided into two groups on the basis of color of tarsi. Color of the tarsi has been considered of prime importance in distinguishing the species boylei and pectoralis in the United States (Osgood, op. cit.) . Specimens with dusky tarsi comprise one group; whitish tarsi characterize the other group. The two categories are more discrete in theory than they are in practice; all stages of intermediacy actually are represented in the series. The localities and number of items in each group follow: Dark tarsi: Arizona, 9; Valencia County, New Mexico, 8; Guadalupe Mountains, Texas, 16; Davis Mountains, Texas, 25; , Kerr County, Texas, 9; Adair County, Oklahoma, 9. Pale tarsi: Chisos Mountains, Texas, 16; Davis Mountains, Texas, 5; Guadalupe Mountains, Texas, 12; Kerr County, Texas, 15 . The specimens from the Guadalupe Mountains and from Kerr County, the latter essentially topotypes of P. b. attwateri and P. p. laceianus, were kindly sent on loan from Texas A. and M. College. -Ratio diagram comparing 7 dimensions of skin and skull in 11 samples of the Peromyscus boylei species group. Seven samples are characterized by dusky tarsi.

The same is true of the series of P. pectoralis. Geographic variations in size and proportions are apparent, but they do not obliterate a morphological pattern that is characteristic of all samples of the species and that differs from the pattern of boylei.Secondly, the identity of the populations from Texas is open to question. The series at hand includes specimens with white tarsi and others with dark tarsi from the vicinity of the type localities of P. b. aUwateri and P. p. laceianus. If both P. boylei and P. pectoralis are represented in my series, then the proportions of P. pectoralis are markedly different in Texas than they are in other regions. Or, if proportions of the two species contrast in Texas as they do elsewhere, specimens from that state cannot be correctly identified on the basis of color of the tarsi.I do not intend that only one form, whether of the species boylei or pectoralis, is represented in the series from Texas. On the contrary, the data suggest that two forms may be present, at least in the Davis and Guadalupe mountains and in Kerr County where both pale and dark tarsi occur. In the series from each of those areas the group of specimens characterized by pale tarsi averages smaller in most external and cranial dimensions and in that group there are, on the average, more caudal annulations per centimeter of tail length. At each of these localities, then, there may be two forms, these distinguishable by size, count of caudal scales, and color of tarsi.The data do cause one to question whether either of those forms is conspecific with P. pectoralis of Mexico. The body proportions of the two groups in Texas are strikingly similar. Although the proportions in each of those groups are somewhat between those of boylei and pectoralis, as those proportions are observed in the samples from Mexico, Arizona, and New Mexico, they are clearly more like those of boylei. It seems probable, therefore, that either P. pectoralis and P. boylei interbreed in Texas, or that the white-and dark-tarsi groups represent closely related forms both of which are more similar to P. boylei than to P. pectoralis. The possibility that both attwateri and laceianus are races of P. boylei will bear investigation.That the relationships of the two forms of the Peromyscus boylei group in western Texas is unclear has already been pointed out by Blair (Tex. Jour. ScL, 1: 17, 1949) . He, too, found that specimens from the region were intermediate in some characters between the forms currently known as P. b. attwaleri and P. p. laceianus. In order to understand the relationships of the forms a detailed study is needed which is based on precise ecological data and adequate series of specimens from many selected localities in Texas.",
