Recent analyses have identified climate change as the seventh most dangerous threat to species on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List and it has been listed as a cause of threat for 19.4% of all species that are listed as near-threatened or threatened 2 . Another study has suggested that global warming could lead to extinction of as much as one in six of all known species 3 . Despite the plethora of existing forecasts, there is consensus that modelling of climate-change effects on large numbers of species distributions is difficult, because there are many uncertainties 4 and factors acting in concert, several of which are unaccounted for in modelling methods 5 . Independent groundtruthing of the models is also often impossible 6 and it adds to the problem that forecasts are often based on models that examine correlations between species distributional data and environmental data. As such, projections are highly contingent on the quality of the data and the models.",

Less frequently acknowledged, however, is that humans can also cause species to be absent from large portions of their distributions owing to human-induced local or regional extinctions 9, 10 .

However, anthropogenic post-Columbus range contractions are reasonably well-documented for many large mammals in North America 9 . The extent of historical human modification of species ranges is such that, on a global scale, current range sizes are better predicted by human population growth and population density than by biological traits, such as diet or body size 12 . Similarly, the empirical distribution of body masses around the globe is closer to theoretical expectation when human effects on distributions are taken into account than when they are not 13 . Overall, evidence suggests that a large fraction of all species ranges have had their ranges reduced owing to human impacts 10 .",

These animals are particularly well-suited for such analyses, because most of their range declines are both recent and well-documented. We acknowledge that by using the pre-Columbus ranges as a baseline, we are almost certainly underestimating the magnitude of anthropogenic modifications of the study animals for two reasons. First, the historical distributions of the extant mammals in North America that we analyse were probably influenced by the extinctions of predators and competitors during the Late Pleistocene/Early Holocene megafauna extinctions, which were at least partially anthropogenic in nature (for example, see refs 14, 15 ). Second, it seems unlikely that the regionally high population density in pre-Columbus North America did not influence species distributions for some of the larger mammals, especially given that some ancient Native American cultures reportedly caused sufficient habitat degradation to cause their own collapse 16 . Our main interest is to investigate the effects of input species distribution data on forecasts of global-warming effects on biodiversity and, more specifically, investigate potential improvements caused by the inclusion of historic occurences in such forecasts.",

Ara\u00fajo 3, 4, 5 Forecasts of species range shifts under climate change most often rely on ecological niche models, in which characterizations of climate suitability are highly contingent on the species range data used. If ranges are far from equilibrium under current environmental conditions, for instance owing to local extinctions in otherwise suitable areas, modelled environmental suitability can be truncated, leading to biased estimates of the effects of climate change. Here we examine the impact of such biases on estimated risks from climate change by comparing models of the distribution of North American mammals based on current ranges with ranges accounting for historical information on species ranges. We find that estimated future diversity, almost everywhere, except in coastal Alaska, is drastically underestimated unless the full historical distribution of the species is included in the models. Consequently forecasts of climate change impacts on biodiversity for many clades are unlikely to be reliable without acknowledging anthropogenic influences on contemporary ranges. records in predicting fossil occurrences, highlighting that the contemporary records do not adequately capture species niches.",

First, species with the most records are very widespread and a larger fraction of the apparent absences in the fossil sites of these species may therefore be false negatives than in more range-restricted species. This makes comparisons between presences and pseudo-absences especially problematic for these species and could obscure any effect if it was present. Second, the species that are the most recorded are generally habitat generalists that may be rather resistant to antropogenic effects.

Therefore, predictions based only on contemporary records lead to biased results. Why do such biases arise? Model predictions generated strictly from historical records were generally similar to predictions generated with historical and contemporary records combined. By contrast, model predictions generated with the contemporary record were very different from predictions using all records combined. The differences between models using current or all records could potentially be attributed to sample size. However, such a proposition would fail to explain the similarity between results from historical and all records, and importantly it also fails to explain why we also observe better predictions for the occurrences of fossils based on historical records (a total of 34,689 records) relative to the models only using current records (a total of 45,518 records). The differences are thus best assignable to human modifications of species realized niches. The problem that we identify here For all species, the improvement in suitability was calculated for fossil sites relative to non-fossil sites. The y axis defines the difference in improvement for models based on historical and contemporary records. A positive value represents models based on historical records that perform better than models based on contemporary records when hind-casted to predict fossil occurrences. The x axis is the number of fossil occurrences for each species. A horizontal black line separates the 28 species for which the model based on historical records performed best from the 8 species for which the model based on contemporary records performed best.

We cannot at present know the extent to which such extrapolation is justifiable. There is little reason to assume that the effect is restricted to North America (although we may lack the needed historical range data to show this for other continents), but different taxonomical groups may be influenced to different extents. Larger mammals, such as those on which we focus here, may require larger natural areas making biases even at coarse scales as those used here substantial. However, at least on a medium scale (with cell width of 2-8 km), it has recently been shown that markedly biased estimates of niches of common European trees were produced unless anthropogenic habitat modifications were incorporated into the models 18 .",

Even for species without changes in ranges, incorporation of historical records may therefore increase information on the species niche and therefore the precision of the results. The importance of such temporal variation was recently highlighted in a study of temporal variation in estimated niches of European and North American trees 23 , and we cannot rule out that this could explain part of the superiority of the models based on historical data in explaining fossil occurrences relative to models based on contemporary records. However, we note that it cannot create the large predicted differences in the consequences of global warming, as the models based on contemporary records are based on a warmer climate, which if anything should reduce the effects of global warming relative to the models based on the historical records from an, on average, colder climate. Although our analysis shows that biased estimates of species distributional changes under climate change would be inferred when only the current ranges were used for the larger North American mammals, it could be argued that such an effect might be restricted to large vertebrates as they are among the organisms most influenced by humans. The argument holds true for direct effects on species range, for example, through hunting 10 , but it may not necessarily be true for secondary effects that are often mediated by the loss of biotic interactions with larger species. Substantial evidence (for example, refs [24] [25] [26] ) suggests that mammalian communities may be an important factor governing the overall vegetation structure. It therefore seems plausible that the misidentifications of future ranges that will arise for large mammals based on contemporary records, as we show here, could also lead to substantial errors for other groups due to the substantial ability of large mammals to modify their environment.",

These findings are noteworthy, because they contradict the longstanding view that species would tend to favourably persist near the core of their ranges 28 . However, one of the consequences of species persisting near range edges when exposed to massive range contractions is that assessments of climate niches based on extant distributions is likely to be truncated 7 , potentially leading to biases in model projections under climate change 8 . While studies involving hind-casting projections of species distributions have often involved multiple historical datasets to reduce biases inherent to modelling ranges using temporal snapshots of data (for example, ref. 29 ), forecasting studies have rarely used historical sources of data to reduce the biases. One reason is that historical species range data are scarce and typically restricted to a few groups of organisms, such as mammals. An explicit incorporation of older records will, therefore, seldom be possible and researchers will often be forced to rely on contemporary records alone. If researchers are forced to rely on contemporary records as they often are, we suggest that they consider spatially explicit models, as these recently have been shown to be able to identify plausible areas in which absences are probably caused by anthropogenic rather than climatic factors 30 . Unless alternative measures (such as the spatially explicit models) are adopted to reduce biases related to characterizations of species-climate relationships from highly modified ranges, models of global-change effects on species ranges will carry substantial biases as those that were found here for North American mammals.",

We analysed the climatic niches of 48 terrestrial North American mammals larger than 1 kg and including only the species with more than 10 reliable and spatially separated presence records (See 'Recent and historical presence data' and 'Fossil presence data'). The requirement for spatially separated records was defined to reduce pseudo-replication owing to spatial autocorrelation. Specifically, we restricted the use of presence records to only those that were located more than 55 km apart. To assess the consequences of anthropogenic modifications of forecasts of climate-change effects on potential distributions of species, we generated three sets of models: with (1) historical presence records (non-fossil GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility) records older than 1965 (older than 50 years when we downloaded the records)); (2) contemporary presence records (from 1965 onwards); and (3) all records combined. To correct for differences in sample sizes between historical records and contemporary ones (the latter with more presence records available), we generated model runs after subsampling the data to equalize the number of records used in both iterations.",

Once models were fit, the ensemble of projections from all eight models was combined into a weighted average consensus 32 for each model according to the level of matching between predicted distributions and observed distributions in the test data using the 'True Skill' statistic 33 . We generated six separate sets of ensembles of models based on differences in pseudo-absence selection (different combinations of whether or not the pseudo-absences are randomly distributed in climate space or geographical space or cells in specific parts of the climate and or geographical space are more likely to be selected; see 'Pseudo-absences'). We conducted a principal component analysis (PCA) on the difference in predicted suitability between contemporary and future climate based on each one of these six criteria and identified two clusters of models 34 . The first of the clusters contained results from four of the six pseudo-absence criteria and was grouped on the first axis of the PCA, thus accounting for the greatest proportion of the variation brought by pseudo-absence selection. We obtained consensuses for each cluster by un-weighted average. For all analyses, we only discuss the results from the first cluster, as the models it is consisted of account for the greatest proportion of the variance and hence represents the greatest consensus.",

Third, we deleted records if they corresponded to specimens noted as captive specimens, subfossil occurrences, or if they were from populations released outside their historically known range or if the locality given corresponds to known captive populations or non-native populations. The motivation for this third exclusion criterion was that we wanted to compare the patterns across species and, therefore, wanted to standardize the treatment of all species as much as possible, which is difficult if non-native ranges are included. Fourth, we deleted observations outside the historical ranges (for older records) or current range (for contemporary ones) if they were only based on indirect evidence, such as footprints, records outside the range for which coordinates matched museums in which collections are deposited as well as a few records so far outside the historical and or current range of the species that we judged that they probably represented errors.",

A full list of all deviations from GBIF can be found in Supplementary Data 1.

In one set of analyses, we hind-casted species distribution models to compare known fossil or sub-fossil occurrences with predicted suitability of the species in question. For these, we downloaded and cleaned all records of sub-fossil or fossil mammals from the Neotoma database 38 with a maximum age of 120,000 years or less. The taxonomy of this database was standardized to meet that of ref. 39 , which follows IUCN for extant species. Such standardization is trivial when the taxonomy used by Neotoma recognizes more species than the one from ref. 39 , as is the case for bison, for which we considered all extinct forms to be chronospecies of the extant Bison bison or for Martes nobilis, which we considered a synonym of Martes americana. It is more problematic when our taxonomy is recognizing taxa considered conspecific by Neotoma. The latter is, for example, the case for the red wolf C. rufus, which Neotoma consider a subspecies of Canis lupus. In this case, we could only assign fossils identified at subspecies level (as Canis lupus rufus) to Canis rufus. We assigned the remainder to Canis lupus, but we acknowledge that a small proportion of the records only identified to Canis lupus without subspecies designation may actually belong to Canis rufus instead. Records only identified to genus were included when we only accept one species to these genera (for example, records identified as Antilocapra sp.), however, these were excluded when they belong to genera with multiple species. We only analysed species with at least three fossil occurrences and therefore only used 42 out of 48 species described here.",

Second, we calculated the expected climatic conditions at the fossil site as the mean of the climatic conditions for each year between the minimum and maximum age of the fossil site. For maximum temperature and temperature seasonality, we took the mean, and for minimum precipitation and precipitation seasonality, we took the mean of the logtransformed data rather than the logarithm to the mean. In addition, we calculated the sum of the standard deviation for maximum temperature and the standard deviation of temperature seasonality for the values for the fossil site, which we will refer to as the 'dating-related uncertainty' .",

This problem will be worse for sites with the largest dating-related uncertainty and would therefore be mitigated by removing these. In order to do this without removing many fossil sites unnecessarily, causing further problems related to small sample sizes, we identified the dating-related uncertainty maximizing (mean(suitability) -standard error(suitability)), when only calculated for samples with a dating-related uncertainty lower than that value. This optimization was carried out for models based on contemporary records, which may cause a small bias favouring the performance of models based on contemporary records relative to models based on historical records. Our aim is to estimate whether models based on historical records perform better than models based on contemporary ones and this therefore causes our analyses to be more conservative.",

This was likewise done using an exponential distribution (P = 1\u2212 e\u2212 d ), where d was the minimum geographical distance to the range polygon or record of the species.

There were two overall clusters from the six models (loading from the PCA can be seen in Supplementary Table 3 ). One cluster, hereafter referred to as the main cluster, contained four out of six models (the ones not allowing any pseudo-absence within the range polygon) and another contained the remaining two. Analyses were based on the unweighted average of the results for all criteria within a cluster. Only results based on the main cluster are shown in the main text and results based on the additional clusters are shown in the Supplementary Information (Supplementary Figs. 4-7 , Supplementary  Tables 4, 5 ). Model transferability is not necessarily a good predictor of model performance 6 .

Niche modelling. We aimed to compare the niche estimated from contemporary records alone (1965 or younger), historical records alone (non-fossil records older than 1965), and all records combined. In order to remove effects of sample size when comparing models, an additional set of analyses was conducted based on all records but subsampled to have the same number of presences as the contemporary dataset. For each species, for each type of pseudo-absence, for each of the 50 sets of presences and pseudo-absences, we fitted eight separate models using the default parameters in Biomod2 31 (three regression-based models (generalized linear models, generalized additive models and multivariate adaptive regression splines), four machine-learning methods (artificial neural networks, Breiman and Cutler's random forest for classification, Classification tree Analysis and generalized boosting models) and a flexible discriminant analysis). Once fit, the resulting ensemble derived from all eight models was combined into a consensus projection with a 'True Skill Statistic' 33 -weighted average. Following ref. 32 , these initial models were estimated based on 75% of the data with the remaining 25% used to test the model, but, following refs 33,54, , the final predictions were based on 100% of the data.Climate-change predictions. In order to determine the effects of input-response data on climate-change analyses, we focussed on the overall patterns for all 48 species combined. For each cell, we calculated the sum of the suitabilites for all species in both the current and the 2070 climate, excluding species with suitabilities below 0.25.Predictions of fossil occurrences. We also hind-casted the species distribution models and looked at the ability of models to predict fossil occurrence patterns. For this, models were assessed by examining the difference between the projected climate suitability within fossil sites where occurrences were found and random hypothetical fossil sites treated as pseudo-absences (only including fossil sites with lower climatic uncertainty due to uncertain dating than the species-specific threshold for accepting presences) (hereafter we refer to this difference as \u0394 Suitability). Our restriction of pseudo-absences is similar to the approach in ref. 55 and reduces false negatives, because it guarantees that fossilization is possible at all potential pseudo-absence sites. We estimated the statistical significance of the \u0394 Suitability values as the fraction of randomly sampled fossil sites having as large an average suitability as the average suitability of the true fossil occurrences.For some of the species with the widest niche, such as grey wolves (C. lupus), only a small portion of the fossil sites may be outside the species niche and the frequency of false negatives may be very high. \u0394 Suitability values near zero for the most generalized species may therefore be non-informative, because of a large fraction of false absences. Likewise, \u0394 Suitability values near 0 may be essentially non-informative for species with a very low number of fossil records due to power issues. For comparisons of \u0394 Suitabilities between models constructed with different sets of records, we focussed on species that have a significant \u0394 Suitability based on all records on the basis of the main cluster of species distribution models (a total of 36 species). We report resulting values based on six additional species (which have at least three fossil records) in the Supplementary Tables  (Supplementary Tables 1, 4 ).Code availability.
