The so-called \"censuses\" of game populations published from time to time by various federal and state bureaus are, as a rule, only rough guesses. It is obvious that no game manager can cover a number of square miles of territory and know with any accuracy the number of elk, deer, bears, wolves, coyotes, bobcats, cougars, and other animals that live there. It is true that from the evidence of tracks and other signs he may get a general impression of mammalian abundance and he may even from time to time observe one or more of these animals. But naturalists will agree that any population figures he may produce are only crude estimates whose value is directly dependent upon the experience and judgment of the field man. With the enormous areas to be covered and the few experienced men available for the work it is unreasonable to expect accuracy in such estimates of game populations.",

In conducting such drives it is difficult, however, to make sure that all the regular inhabitants of the area are seen, for some deer are so shy that they may leave the plot immediately at the first disturbance before the counting lines are established. Again I have known deer to skulk in thick cover and remain undetected by the line of beaters. According to McCain (1939) , the size of area needed for an adequate deer census has not yet been determined and under any circumstances a deer drive is expensive because of the labor involved. Nevertheless, when properly conducted over a sufficiently large area, a drive should give, for certain species of mammals, a reasonably accurate count of the population.",

This difficulty can be in part overcome by using a large number of traps, but this is expensive in equipment and labor. If the traps are left set for a number of nights it is true that a larger proportion of the population will be caught but then immigrants and transients from outside the area also will be captured, giving an exaggerated indication of the size of the population. The setting of additional traps in a guard or buffer strip around the trap quadrat (Cahalane, 1941: 49) will not certainly prevent immigration onto the plot and these additional traps introduce other complications into the calculations (Dice, 1938: 126) . The amount of immigration into a plot may be expected to be greater if the inhabitants are removed than if they are only marked and released.",

Unfortunately, these conditions seem never to be fully realized. Within most plots some areas seem not to be included in any home range. The home ranges of the males furthermore, often overlap each other (Dalke and Sime, 1938: 667-668; Blair, 1940d, fig. 1 ). It is true that the breeding females of some species seem to occupy nearly exclusive territories (Burt, 1940: 26-29; Haugen, ms.) but in others the home ranges of the breeding females overlap broadly (Blair, 1940d, fig. 2 Another proportional method has been suggested by Vorhies and Taylor (1933: 557-559) , who counted the jack rabbits observed during a given period of time within a particular fenced enclosure and at the same time counted the number of cattle observed. It was assumed that the proportion of the number of cattle observed to those present in the enclosure would be the same as the proportion of the number of jack rabbits seen to the total number in the same area. The number of cattle actual-ly present in the enclosure being known, the total number of jack rabbits was therefore calculated. However, the difference in habits and in visibility of cattle and jack rabbits is so great that it may be questioned if the ratios of numbers observed to those actually present can properly be assumed to be identical in the two species. Formulas for calculating the number of rats in a population from the number of individuals taken in a given number of traps have been developed by Leslie and Davis (1939) . These are based on the assumptions that the movements of rats are at random and that the trapping technics are so efficient that any rat coming into contact with a trap is caught. The law of movement of molecules in a gas should, with some modification, therefore apply. However, the slight information we have about the behavior of mammals in nature is that their movements are not at random. Such indices may or may not be convertible into terms of population density. For many practical uses however, it is sufficient to know the relative abundance of a particular species in different areas or at different times, without having an exact count of the population.",

Ruhl (1932: 448) calculates an index of the abundance of deer and other animals by reducing the counts to the number of tracks made per hour across an average mile of line.

Mammalogists usually set their traps in lines, because a line is more easily set and serviced than a grid. highly variable, as any hunter can testify (see Erickson, 1940) . Also the distance at which animals are seen depends upon the thickness of the cover, on the activity of the animals, on the light conditions, and on numerous other factors, of which the alertness of the observer is not the least important. When, in a modification of the method, the attempt is made to count only the individuals seen within a certain specified distance of the path or the highway the possibility of error in estimating the correct distance likewise is very high. For these reasons it is highly unscientific to attempt to estimate the actual density of mammalian populations per unit area from such observations. The indices of mammalian abundance described above are undoubtedly of value to the game manager who is interested in knowing whether a given species is increasing or decreasing in abundance at a given locality. There is considerable difficulty, however, in converting any of these indices into terms of actual populations. If mathematical formulas allowing for such conversion are later developed it is unlikely that they will be much used, because the number of observations necessary in order to provide a satisfactory statistical base will almost certainly be in excess of that which it is practicable to make. Counts made on sample plots or lines will nearly always furnish the basic data on which estimates of mammalian populations are made and it is, therefore, important to be able to determine whether the plots or lines used are large, numerous, or typical enough to provide a reliable basis for the calculations. Statistical methods for testing the reliability of the means derived from the samples have in the past been little used by mammalogists. We can be sure, however, that statistical analysis will become increasingly important in the future as biological technics for obtaining population counts in the field become improved. When comparable counts are available in quantity, their interpretation and evaluation will require many new applications of statistics.

The length of trapline necessary to capture a sufficient number of individuals to provide data for statistical comparisons depends upon the average width of the individual home ranges of the species concerned. In general the trap line must be long enough to capture a sufficient number of individual animals to give a reliable sample of the population. If we wish to capture a minimum of 10 animals then the trap line should extend at least long enough to include the home ranges of that many individuals. One method commonly employed to obtain an index of mammalian abundance is often improperly used as a basis for calculating population density. The observer walks or drives in an automobile a measured distance through the area and counts the number of individuals that he sees of the species concerned. Then he assumes that all the individuals are observed to an average certain distance on each side of his path and from this he calculates the population per acre or per square mile. A variation of this method is to have several observers walk in a line. Such counting should give a good index of relative abundance if due attention is paid to type of cover, season, weather, time of day, experience of the observer, and other factors that may affect the result.

First it is assumed that there is a completely random distribution of the marked animals throughout the population. However, it is evident that animals which already have more or less fixed home ranges will not become distributed at random after they are marked. This objection may in part be met by widespread random trapping over the area both during the marking period and during the second counting period. Secondly, it is assumed that there is no loss of marked animals from the area between the first and second trapping periods, nor any increase of animals from any cause. If the area studied be completely enclosed it may be possible to make sure that there is no emigration or immigration, otherwise there will be some error in the calculations.
