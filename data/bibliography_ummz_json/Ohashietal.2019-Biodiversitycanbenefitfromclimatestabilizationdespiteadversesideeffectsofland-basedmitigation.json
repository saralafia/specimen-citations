Here we estimate how climate and land-based mitigation efforts interact with global biodiversity by using an integrated assessment model framework to project potential habitat for five major taxonomic groups. We find that stringent GHG mitigation can generally bring a net benefit to global biodiversity even if land-based mitigation is adopted. This trend is strengthened in the latter half of this century. In contrast, some regions projected to experience much growth in land-based mitigation efforts (i.e., Europe and Oceania) are expected to suffer biodiversity loss. Our results support the enactment of stringent GHG mitigation policies in terms of biodiversity. To conserve local biodiversity, however, these policies must be carefully designed in conjunction with land-use regulations and societal transformation in order to minimize the conversion of natural habitats.",

According to the IUCN Red List, 198 vertebrates have been verified as 'extinct' since 1900, and the average rate of vertebrate species loss over the last century was 22 times higher than in the pre-anthropogenic era 1, 2 . Land-use change has been the largest driver of this biodiversity loss 1, 3 . In particular, the expansion of agricultural area to support an increasing global population has caused major ecosystem changes over millenia 1 . While the global population increased from 1650 million in 1900 4 to 6145 million in 2000 5 , agricultural area increased from 21 million km 2 in 1900 to 50 million km 2 in 2000, covering about 35% of the Earth's land surface 6 . Climate change is also becoming a major threat to biodiversity 3, 7, 8 . Since 1880, there has been an average warming of 0.85\u00b0C globally 9 , and many organisms are likely changing their distributions as a means of adapting to climate change 10 .",

Although these political frameworks are focused on the near future, it is also important to take a longer perspective along with these policy frameworks in order to project long-term global sustainable development. As we move towards a global population of 9-10 billion people by 2050, striking a balance between competing demands for land to provide goods and services (e.g., food, water, timber, energy, settlements and recreation) and safeguarding Earth's life-support system will become more critical issues as we aim to achieve sustainable development 12 . Increasing demand for agricultural goods 13 may put pressure on future biodiversity. For example, in newly developed socioeconomic scenarios, so-called shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs), global cropland is projected to expand by 25% and pasture by 6% by 2100 (relative to 2010) in the middle-of-the-road scenario (SSP2), while aggregated area of forest and other natural land is projected to decrease by 6.1 million km 2 by 2100 compared to 2010 14 .",

Previous studies have agreed that reducing the degree of climate change by stringent greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation activities can prevent a substantial loss of biodiversity 7, 8 . However, most of these studies only consider the effects of change in climatic condition 15 . Recently, integrated assessment models revealed that the most stringent GHG mitigation scenarios require substantial land-based mitigation options such as large-scale bioenergy crop production, afforestation, and avoiding deforestation 16, 17 , which would lead to a wide range of possible changes in land use 18, 19 . One study's findings suggested synergy between land-use change for GHG mitigation and biodiversity conservation 20 , whereas others showed that potential land-use changes for GHG mitigation may cause further biodiversity loss 21, 22 . In reality, land-use change and climate change occur simultaneously, and losses or gains of suitable habitats occur not only due to land-use change or climate change, but also due to their combined effects 23, 24 . Therefore, integrated assessment of climate change and land-use change is urgently needed to clarify whether climate change mitigation measures truly contribute to biodiversity conservation.",

We separately account for the beneficial effect of limiting the magnitude of climate change and the effect of additional land-use change, which can be either destructive or preventative. We use a one-way economy-landbiodiversity modelling framework. First, we project regional aggregated land use using the Asia-Pacific Integrated Model/ Computable General Equilibrium Model (AIM/CGE) 25 , which was downscaled to high spatial resolution with the AIM/PLUM model 26 . The AIM/CGE implements climate change mitigation in the form of a global uniform carbon tax on GHG emissions from the agriculture, land-use, and energy sectors. Then, we estimate the losses and gains in suitable habitat for 8428 species in five taxonomic groups (vascular plants, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals) by using a species distribution model based on occurrence-environment correlations. Although projecting future suitable habitats is relatively simple, whether species can occupy a space or not relies on their dispersal abilities 27 . In this study, we incorporate variation of dispersal ability at the species level into the model by using a simple approach based on life-history traits, although more information is needed to represent all of the complex mechanisms related to dispersal 27 (see Methods).",

We consider five alternative scenarios for land-use change that reflect different future socioeconomic development trends, which correspond to five SSPs 28, 29 . Consequently, the total areas of forest (including afforestation) and bioenergy crops are larger in the mitigation scenario than in the baseline scenario, whereas the total areas of cropland (excluding bioenergy crops), pasture, and other natural land are smaller 26 .

Total losses in the baseline scenario were relatively large for species in Europe, Africa, and South America (Fig. 2) . For most regions, total losses of suitable habitat drastically decreased in the mitigation scenario (Figs 2 and 3 ). However, in the 2050s, some scenario-taxon combinations in Europe and Oceania were predicted to experience further loss of suitable habitat in the mitigation scenario. These regional variations in habitat losses can be explained by the magnitude of land-use and climate changes for each region. When looking at the individual effect of land-use change on species' suitable habitat loss, the magnitude of loss was correlated with the proportion of land that has changed from the current to another land use ( Fig. 4a) . Similarly, the proportion of habitat loss due to climate change was correlated with the degree of change in the maximum temperature of the warmest month, one of the 19 bioclimatic variables used to construct models (Fig. 4b ). In the regions predicted to have large land-use changes in the mitigation scenario (e.g., Europe), only a small reduction in the total loss of suitable habitat was achieved by mitigation due to the increased loss of suitable habitat by land-use change (Figs 3  and 4 ).",

                "text": "Our results highlight the fact that climate change mitigation can reduce the risk of species loss at a global scale, but we must consider the effects of land-use change associated with GHG mitigation efforts. Certain losses of suitable habitat were inevitable under both mitigation and baseline scenarios. This is partly due to the nature of the climate characteristics, because even if GHG emissions were immediately halted, temperature rise could continue until the middle of the century. When looking at the individual effect of the two drivers, climate change had marked effects on loss/gain of suitable habitat regardless of differences in future socioeconomic development trends (Fig. 1) , which was consistent with previous studies at a larger spatial scale 32 . The spatial extent of each driver differs: climate change affects all of the land surfaces, whereas land-use change occurs locally. Even in the 2070s, >70% of the terrestrial land surface was unchanged in both scenarios ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ). Therefore, although stringent mitigation measures have been implemented, substantially more area can be affected by the residual impacts of climate change relative to that of land-use change. Note, however, that our results may underestimate the impact of land-use change for two reasons. First, our models focus on land-cover change and are based on the assumption that the effect of land-use intensity within each land-use type does not affect species' habitat suitability. For example, all of the five SSP scenarios more or less estimate an increase in crop yield in the future resulting from technological development and irrigation expansion 33 , as reflected in differences in the expansion rates of agricultural land use in this study (i.e., if higher yield is expected, then extension of agricultural land use could be limited). However, increasing crop yield through agricultural practices (e.g., significant input of inorganic fertilizer or pesticide) may add further risks for biodiversity loss 34 and require additional efforts for conservation 35 . Although not all technologies that aim to achieve crop yield increases cause negative impacts on biodiversity 36, 37 , the lack of this factor in our species distribution model may have led to underestimated biodiversity losses from land-use change. As another example, the negative impact of land-use change associated with GHG emission reduction on biodiversity within the forest may become large if the afforestation is conducted with non-native species and without efforts to restore the environment of the original natural forest 21, 22 . These changes in habitat suitability arising from differences in environmental quality may cause systematic bias in our analysis. Second, our analyses only evaluated those species with enough data to construct a species distribution model, meaning that species adapted to a long history of human land use were likely selected. As a result, the effect of land-use change on the species vulnerable to human disturbance might be underestimated in our study.",

These aspects are partially expressed as a difference among SSP scenarios. Because SSPs involve changing several factors simultaneously and it is impossible to identify the factor that determines land-use change, several aspects of the land-use storyline in SSP1 (e.g., strong land-use change regulation, increasing crop yields, low animal-calorie shares, and low waste) 18 may be the candidate feature that contributed to minimize Supplementary Figs 7 and 8 ). This result indicates that reducing society's total energy demand may enhance synergies between GHG mitigation and the prevention of biodiversity loss. Additionally, improving yields on existing croplands by environmentally sustainable intensification techniques 36, 37 and changing our diet 41 might be another option to reduce the additional pressure on biodiversity resulting from GHG mitigation activity. Currently, widely used land-use predictions are generated for single RCP-SSP combinations, which does not allow isolation of pure differences among socio-economic conditions 23 . Further work that explicitly considers various socio-economic conditions and GHG mitigation options will need to specify the critical socioeconomic factor necessary to achieve both GHG mitigation and biodiversity targets.",

This method consists of the following four phases ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ): pre-processing of data, species level modelling of occurrence-environment relationships, estimating available habitat, and decomposing the driver of habitat loss/gain. We used two future scenarios (mitigation and baseline) to evaluate the integrated effects of climate change and Filtering occurrence data from GBIF. We used data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) 51 , which is the largest portal that collects distribution records of species based on digitized collection and survey data. First, we obtained the entire GBIF dataset (as of July 2015) from the secretariat of GBIF. The data contained~560 million records at this stage. From this, records of five major taxonomic groups (vascular plants, mammals, amphibians, reptiles, and birds) were extracted (first-order dataset). We then confirmed geographic location based on the latitude and longitude information; if the recorded country name and geographic location showed any discrepancy, those records were discarded. We also removed occurrence records with no location data and those that did not fall within land areas by referring the GADM database of Global Administrative Areas 52 (second-order dataset), according to Warren et al. 53 . It is common that an occurrence-environmental relationship is not conserved outside of a species' native range 54 . Therefore, from the second-order dataset, we discarded records labelled as \"fossil specimen,\" \"unknown,\" or \"living specimen\" recorded outside of their native ranges (third-order dataset). To ascertain the species' native ranges in the third-order dataset, we referred to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species 55 (http://www.iucnredlist.org/), which contains detailed information on the native ranges of 46,182 species (either continent or country level) for both nonthreatened and threatened species. We matched the third-order dataset and the IUCN data and discarded those records with a discrepancy in location information between the two datasets. Then we labelled the native region as belonging to one of the following seven groups: North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, Oceania, and multiple regions. Occurrence data in Antarctica were excluded from the analysis due to a lack of environmental data. As a result, our analysis is limited to the species already assessed by the IUCN Red List (fourth-order dataset). Finally, to reduce the effect of spatial clustering of records in the dataset 56, 57 , we confined the number of records per cell by subsampling the dataset. We sampled one occurrence record per 0.5 arc degrees grid (ca. 60 \u00d7 60 km at the equator) for all species (final dataset). Also, to avoid the effect of model inaccuracy from small sample size, we limited our analysis to species with \u226530 refined occurrence records 58 .",

For example, by default, MaxEnt selects the background locations (sometimes called pseudo-absences) at the same probability across the target landscape and contrasts background against occurrence to estimate the relative probability of occurrence. However, in practice, occurrence records are likely to be spatially biased towards more easily accessed or better surveyed areas 59 , which are affected by various social constraints 61, 62 . When sampling is biased, the model cannot differentiate whether species are observed in particular environments because those locations are preferable or because they receive the largest search effort. This problem seriously affects the outcome for species distribution models derived from presence-only data and distorts our view of large-scale biodiversity patterns 56, 59 .",

Target group sampling uses the occurrence records of taxonomically related species observed by the same techniques as the focal species to estimate sampling. This method assumes that if the taxonomically related species have been observed in a survey, then the focal species also would have been observed there. To incorporate sampling bias into MaxEnt, we took the bias background approach, which uses the prior information on the spatial distribution of survey effort to preselect background locations before running MaxEnt. In this approach, the effect of sampling bias cancels out because it is common to both occurrence and background. To do this, we combined all occurrence records in the final dataset for each of the five taxonomic groups (including species with \u226430 records). We generated a set of background data for each of the five target groups, weighted by the sampling density of occurrence records 59 .

A species' ability to disperse and track the shifting climate is a crucial trait that determines its future potential for range shifts [76] [77] [78] . However, most of the previous global biodiversity models have not incorporated such realistic dispersal into their future projections and assumed only full-dispersal and no-dispersal scenarios, which has been criticized as unrealistic for most organisms 79 . The ability to simulate realistic dispersal has been limited by lack of knowledge about species' dispersal abilities or by technical constraints of the modelling. Recently, to incorporate more realistic dispersal, various approaches have begun to be used. Previous global scale studies 8, 23, 53 have incorporated a relatively simplistic approach based on the average dispersal rate of each target taxon. In this study, however, we incorporated variation of dispersal ability within taxonomic groups, which has not been considered in other global studies. The dispersal assumptions for each taxon in previous studies 8, 23, 53 were within the range of our estimated value, and no inconsistency occurred (Supplementary Fig. 9 ). Dispersal ability is strongly related to life-history traits, such as the dispersal syndrome and growth form of vascular plants 79 or the body mass and feeding habits of birds and mammals 80 . In this study, we collected information on life-history traits for all target species and used allometric equations based on these traits to estimate dispersal distance and generation length). Species-specific dispersal distance (D) between the present (t 0 ) and future (t 1 ) was calculated as (Eq.1)",

In the model, supply, demand, investment, and trade are described by individual behavioural functions that respond to changes in the prices of production factors and commodities, as well as changes in technology and preference parameters on the basis of assumed population, GDP, and consumer preferences. Land is represented as a part of the production functions, formulated as multi-nested constant elasticity substitution functions. The allocation of land by sector for 17 regions is formulated as a multinomial logit function to reflect differences in substitutability across land rent, and regional land use is further downscaled to high spatial resolution with the AIM/PLUM downscaling model 26 based on spatially explicit attainable yields. The spatial yields are aggregated and fed back into AIM/CGE. The AIM/CGE model has been widely used for climate change impact and adaptation studies 91, 92 .",

The SSPs are based on five narratives describing how socioeconomic factors may change over the next century, considering changes in population, GDP, energy, emissions, and land use. These narratives are designed to span a range of futures in terms of the degree of difficulty for mitigation and adaption to climate change. Two of the SSPs describe futures in which challenges to adaptation and mitigation are both weak (SSP1: sustainability) or both strong (SSP3: regional rivalry). Two 'asymmetric cases' were designed, comprising a case in which strong challenges to mitigation are combined with weak challenges to adaptation (SSP5: fossil-fuelled development), and a case in which the opposite is true (SSP4: inequality). Finally a central case describes a world with intermediate challenges for both adaptation and mitigation (SSP2: middle-of-the-road). The SSPs employ a concept called scenario matrix architecture, which has a two-dimensional space comprising socioeconomic patterns and climate mitigation levels defined by radiative forcing levels. In this study, we used a radiative forcing level of 2.6 W m \u22122 for the mitigation scenario under SSP1, 2, 4, and 5. We used a radiative forcing level of 3.4 W m \u22122 for the mitigation scenario under SSP3, because there was no solution for 2.6 W m \u22122 in SSP3. For the baseline scenario, we used the baseline condition in each SSP, which represents the absence of additional climate policy.",

Bioenergy crops were merged into cropland and afforestation into forests. These assumptions are rather optimistic and may not reflect the variation of environmental quality within each land-use type. For example, a land-use type's environmental condition may vary among management practices, which may cause large differences in local biodiversity (e.g., selection of tree species planted in afforestation 22 , the time required for the forest to mature 94, 95 , and intensification of agricultural activity 34 ). Although these differences may be less pronounced than the effect of land-cover change 34 , we should note that our results may systematically underestimate the impacts of land-use change on biodiversity. Some aspects of agricultural intensification (fertilizer use, pesticide use, or machinery inputs) are endogenously determined in the AIM/CGE model, and all five SSP scenarios more or less estimate increases in agricultural productivity by technological development and irrigation expansion 33 . These effects of crop yield increments are reflected in the expansion rate of agricultural land in our model. However, if these increments are achieved through industrial agricultural practices (such as significant input of inorganic fertilizer or pesticide), it may add further risk for biodiversity loss 34 . On the other hand, the yield-biodiversity relationship is complex and multidimensional, and not all the technologies used to achieve yield increases have a negative impact on biodiversity 36, 37 . Both the dimension (industrial or agro-ecological) of land-use intensification and its effect on biodiversity should be investigated in future research to address the large-scale impacts on global biodiversity that arise from climate change and mitigation activity.",

To identify the drivers causing loss/gain of potential suitable habitat of each species under each scenario, we calculated the potential suitable habitats based on three hypothetical future scenarios (land-use change alone, climate change alone, and both). Finally, we compared the proportion of area loss/gain and the contribution of the two drivers (land-use change and climate change) between the mitigation and baseline scenarios.
