The removal of natural vegetation changes local climate, with human-dominated land uses often warmer and drier than natural habitats. Yet, it remains an open question whether land-use changes influence the composition of ecological assemblages in a direction consistent with the mechanism of local climatic change. Here, we used a global database of terrestrial vertebrates (mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians) to test whether human-dominated land uses systematically favour species with distinctive realised climatic niches. We 1) explored the responses of community-average temperature and precipitation niches to different types of land use, 2) quantified the abundances of species with distinctive climatic niches across land uses and 3) tested for differences in emergent patterns in communities from tropical versus temperate latitudes. We found that, in comparison to species from undisturbed natural habitats, the average animal found in human-altered habitats lives in areas with higher maximum and lower minimum temperatures and higher maximum and lower minimum precipitation levels. We further found that tropical assemblages diverged more strongly than temperate assemblages between natural and human-altered habitats, possibly because tropical species are more sensitive to climatic conditions. These results strongly implicate the role of land-use change in favouring species affiliated with more extreme climatic conditions, thus systematically reshaping the composition of terrestrial biological assemblages. Our findings have the potential to inform species' vulnerability assessments and highlight the importance of preserving local climate refugia.",

The temperature regimes of croplands, pastures and (to a lesser extent) plantation forests differ from primary forests, with increases in temperature often reported (Senior et al. 2017) . Forest canopies can also buffer temperature extremes (Ewers and Banks-Leite 2013) , with both increases in maximum temperatures (hot extremes) and slight decreases in minimum temperatures (cold extremes) recorded in non-forested human-disturbed habitats, such as agricultural areas (Alkama and Cescatti 2016, De Frenne et al. 2019) . Along with a local warming effect, the variability in temperature extremes differs between land uses; for example, day-to-day maximum temperatures are more variable and thus less predictable in pastures compared to forested habitats (Frishkoff et al. 2015) . Further, disturbed habitats may offer fewer microhabitat refugia compared to primary vegetation (Gonz\u00e1lez del Pliego et al. 2016) . Water regimes may also differ among land uses, with the removal of vegetation reducing precipitation levels and moisture feedback into the atmosphere (Savenije 1995 , Sampaio et al. 2007 . Overall, human-altered habitats tend to be hotter and drier than natural, more vegetated habitats (Britter and Hanna 2003 , Frishkoff et al. 2016 , Senior et al. 2017 . These localised climatic changes are expected to shift the types of species that can colonise and survive under altered environmental conditions (Frishkoff et al. 2016 , Nowakowski et al. 2018 .",

Here, climatic niches are referring to the climatic dimensions of a species' classic niche sensu Hutchinson (Hutchinson 1957 ). Species' tolerance limits (fundamental climatic niches) have typically been measured using physiological tolerance assays in the laboratory (Frishkoff et al. 2015) . Such tolerance assays provide estimates of climatic tolerance limits in the absence of other environmental factors -although only for species that can survive in artificial laboratory conditions -and return thresholds that may be decoupled from population shifts in nature (Mitchell et al. 2018) . By contrast, realised climatic niches (the range of environmental conditions occupied in nature; HilleRisLambers et al. 2013) are estimated from observed species' distributions (Barnagaud et al. 2013) . Realised niches are also influenced by non-abiotic factors and consequently may not capture species' true climatic limits (Ara\u00fajo et al. 2013 , HilleRisLambers et al. 2013 . For example, species' realised climatic niches may also partially be a product of the spatial (and thus climatic) distribution of their critical habitats (Barnagaud et al. 2012 (Barnagaud et al. , 2013 . However, realised niches are often the only feasible measures of climatic tolerances for the majority of species. The combination of realised climatic niche estimates with species assemblage data has emerged as a key tool to quantify the effects of climatic changes on the composition of whole assemblages (Oliver et al. 2017) .",

Lower forest cover and deforestation of primary forest to non-forest land uses have been shown to favour vertebrate species inhabiting (realised niche) or tolerant of (fundamental niche) warmer conditions (when comparing both average and maximum temperatures; e.g. French birds, Barnagaud et al. 2013; Costa Rican and Columbian ectothermic vertebrates, Frishkoff et al. 2015, Nowakowski et al. 2018) . Vegetation removal can also select species relatively tolerant of drier climates, and thus with drier realised precipitation niches (e.g. Costa Rican birds, Frishkoff et al. 2016; insects, Menke et al. 2011 , Piano et al. 2017 . Animals in human-altered sites may also have to be tolerant of greater climatic variation, due to changes in vegetation structure, subsequent potential loss of climate-buffering microhabitats and greater variation in temperatures in some human-disturbed land uses compared to natural habitats (Frishkoff et al. 2015 , Gonz\u00e1lez del Pliego et al. 2016 . Indeed, the average breadth of climatic niches within species assemblages can be wider in urban compared to nonurban (rural or forest) assemblages (Barnagaud et al. 2012 , Piano et al. 2017 . Very few studies have considered how both maximum and minimum extremes of climatic conditions, and variability in exposure to extremes, may impact assemblages in disturbed habitats.",

Many species in the tropics are also exposed to temperatures that are closer to their upper thermal tolerance limits, leading to the expectation that tropical species will be relatively sensitive to warming and the removal of thermal refugia (Deutsch et al. 2008 , Khaliq et al. 2014 , Sunday et al. 2014 .

The extent of occurrence maps for terrestrial mammals, amphibians and reptiles were acquired from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN 2016) and for birds from BirdLife International (2012). Since we were interested in the full extent of species' natural ranges, we included all parts of the geographic range where the species occurrence status was considered to be extant, probably extant, possibly extinct or extinct (post 1500); and we included areas where the species is thought to be resident or present in the breeding or non-breeding seasons. Specifically, we excluded areas where the species is possibly extant, its presence is uncertain or is vagrant, and areas that are used for relatively short periods of the year as passages during migration or if the seasonal occurrence is uncertain. The range maps for birds followed the same coding scheme as those provided by IUCN. The original polygon maps were rasterised to an equal-area grid (500 \u00d7 500 m per pixel; WGS 1984 Cylindrical Equal Area projection). We selected this resolution as a compromise between the computational limitations of small spatial grains and the need to include as many very-narrow-ranged species as possible. For species with known elevational limits (number of species with only upper limit known = 2264, lower limit known = 9, both limits known = 694; IUCN 2016, BirdLife International 2018), distribution maps were cut by these limits (which is standard practice when estimating species' extent-of-occurrence; Jetz et al. 2007) .",

Therefore, we tested the robustness of our realised climatic niche estimates by comparing our main results to results using climatic niches derived from occurrence records in the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF, < www.gbif.org >), which provides information on area of occupancy (see Supplementary material Appendix 2 for details on how we acquired realised niche estimates from GBIF data).

CWMs are calculated by finding the average of each species' climatic niche property across all species in an assemblage, weighted by species' abundance (Jiguet et al. 2011 , Oliver et al. 2017 . As an example, higher CWM values for maximum T max (denoted by CWM(maxT max )) signifies communities with higher proportions of individuals of species found in areas with relatively higher maximum temperatures. At the other end of the spectrum, lower CWM values for minimum T min (CWM(minT min )) reflects communities with higher proportions of individuals of species affiliated with lower minimum temperatures. We use CWM(maxPp max ) and CWM(minPp min ) to refer to the community weighted means for maximum Pp max and minimum Pp min , respectively. Similarly, communities with higher CWM T max range-wide variation are composed of higher proportions of individuals of species that occupy areas experiencing a larger range of maximum temperatures. Further, we produced CWMs unweighted by species abundance (i.e. average for a species within a community, Supplementary material Appendix 4) to check that weighting by abundance did not affect our results. We also calculated the correlations between the community-average climatic niche properties to see whether changes in these properties across land uses may be linked (Supplementary material Appendix 5). In addition, to explore the potential influence of outliers on CWMs, we also a) produced community weighted medians (i.e. the median value of each species' climatic extreme and variation across all species in an assemblage, weighted by species' abundance), and b) produced CWMs after excluding the upper and lower 2.5% of species-level climatic extremes and range-wide variation values.",

However, community change is multi-dimensional, and the same numerical responses can be underpinned by different responses of species with distinctive climatic niches, representing alternative mechanisms of change. For instance, having a greater proportion of individuals from species affiliated with warmer maximum temperatures and/ or fewer individuals from species affiliated with colder maximum temperatures could both contribute to higher CWM(maxT max ) values (Jiguet et al. 2011) . Whether a species has higher or lower abundances in certain land-use types also likely depends on the breadth of climatic conditions they are able to tolerate. Thus, we explored how differences in the abundance of species groups with different climatic niche properties contribute to changes in community-level properties. To do so, we investigated the response to land use of species with different climatic niches (climatic extremes and range-wide variation). For this analysis, due to the prediction that responses to land use will differ between geographic zones, assemblages at tropical and temperate latitudes were analysed separately. Species within each assemblage were split a) into four groups around the within-study medians of the T max maximum and range-wide variation and then, separately, b) into four groups based on Pp min minimum and range-wide variation (Supplementary material Appendix 6 Table A5, A6). We focused on T max and Pp min for this analysis because the differences in CWMs across land uses were strongest for these climatic variables.",

Measures of these two covariates from each site were acquired from WorldClim ver. 1.4 (Hijmans et al. 2005 ). Species' range size influences sensitivity to land use , an effect that may be independent of range-wide climatic variation, with which it is often strongly correlated (Supplementary material Appendix 7 Table A7 ). Therefore, we also considered 3) community-average range size as a potential covariate in models of CWM range-wide climatic variation. The community-average range sizes (community weighted means) were presented in and published alongside the paper (doi: 10.6084/ m9.figshare.7262732). The estimates were based on the same species' distribution maps as described above. The polygon maps were first projected onto an equal-area grid using the Project_management function, and the area of each polygon calculated using the CalculateAreas_stats function, in ArcGIS 10.4 (ESRI 2015). The areas of the polygons were then summed to estimate the total range area of each species, before a community weighted mean was calculated, weighted by abundance . CWM range sizes were unobtainable for 18.7% of assemblages, so these assemblages were excluded in range-wide climatic variation analyses, leaving 4977 assemblages composed of 3415 species (394 mammals, 2649 birds, 74 reptiles and 298 amphibians).

We log(x + 1) transformed CWM(maxPp max ) and CWM(minPp min ). We selected fixed effects using backwards stepwise model simplification (with the models fitted using maximum likelihood; Zuur et al. 2009) . Land use, geographic zone (tropical or temperate), and the interaction of zone with land use were always included as categorical fixed effects. Sites were classified as 'Tropical' if located between 23.44\u00b0N and 23.44\u00b0S, and 'Temperate' if located between the tropics and Arctic or Antarctic Circle (thus including boreal habitats between 50 and 60\u00b0N, as there were not enough data to classify them separately). The site's elevation and the value of the climatic variable in question at each site were added as continuous covariates into the backwards stepwise model simplification. We set a threshold for excluding correlated covariates at |r| > 0.5 (recommended for mixed-effects models by Harrison et al. 2018) ; if the correlation between elevation and the value of the climatic variable in question at each site were above this threshold, the climatic variable was kept preferentially, as it likely had a more direct influence on communities. For CWM range-wide climatic variation, we also included CWM range size ) as a continuous covariate into the backwards stepwise model simplification. Within all models we also included a nested random-intercept term for study identity (to account for non-random structure in the response data due to studydependent differences, e.g. sampling methods) and for the spatial 'blocks' of sampled sites within studies. We did not include random slopes in our models (i.e. to let the effect of land use vary across studies) due to convergence issues, which were likely caused by the unbalanced sampling of land uses among studies. However, despite the convergence issues, the results for models with random slopes (not shown) were quantitatively very similar. Further, CWMs may be prone to type I errors (Miller et al. 2019) ; so, for each CWM model, we also used a null model approach to further test the significance of our observed results. To produce null models, we randomly shuffled species-level climatic affiliations between species within each study (we randomised within studies because of the hierarchical structure and global spread of the PREDICTS dataset; Cornwell and Ackerly 2010, Yang et al. 2012) . For each CWM model, 999 randomisations were produced. We then compared our observed results to those produced from the null models using the randomised datasets, with results classed as significant if they were outside the lower 2.5th or upper 97.5th percentile of the null model (i.e. a two-tailed test).",

In these models, advanced and young secondary vegetation categories were grouped to become 'secondary vegetation' to ensure all land-use categories had data for over 50 assemblages in each model.

To check whether this was the case, we explored the influence of habitat specialisation on climatic niche differences across land uses. We first compared species-level climatic niche properties with an index of species-level habitat breadth, and then compared specieslevel climatic niche properties between forest specialists and non forest-specialists (Supplementary material Appendix 10). Finally, we ran two sets of models to compare the responses to land use in community-average climatic metrics when forest specialist species were included and excluded from analyses.

Our findings were robust to several possible confounding issues. First, very small differences were observed between community-average climatic niche properties produced with and without migratory bird species included (Supplementary material Appendix 11 Table A20 , BirdLife International 2018), so migratory species were included in the analyses. Second, using a null model approach provided additional support for our results relating to communityaverage climatic extreme affiliations, with the majority of observed results found to be significant using a two-tailed test (Fig. 1) . However, fewer observed community-average range-wide climatic variation results were significantly different in comparison to null expectations (Fig. 1) , thus we urge caution when interpreting these results. Third, when using occurrence data from GBIF, the results were generally qualitatively and quantitatively very similar to those presented in the main text (Supplementary material Appendix 2 Fig.  A1-A3 ). Fourth, correlations among community-average climatic niche properties were generally low, though a few (e.g. between CWM T max range-wide variation, CWM T min rangewide variation and CWM(minT min )) were more highly correlated (Supplementary material Appendix 5 Table A4 ). Fifth, correlations between species-level climatic niche properties and habitat breadth were all low (|r| < 0.41). Although there were some differences observed between species-level climatic niche properties for species classed as forest versus non forestspecialists (Supplementary material Appendix 10 Fig. A7 ), the results from models including and excluding forest specialists were also qualitatively and quantitatively very similar (Supplementary material Appendix 10 Fig. A8, A9) . Finally, using community weighted medians or CWMs that excluded the upper and lower 2.5% of species-level climatic affiliations both produced qualitatively and quantitatively very similar results to models produced using CWMs that included all species (results not shown), from this we are confident that our results are not being driven by outliers.",

This is driven by human-altered land uses having both higher and lower abundances of species with different climatic niches. Specifically, assemblages in human-disturbed land uses were composed of greater proportions of individuals of species affiliated with higher maximum temperature and precipitation and lower minimum temperature and precipitation. These results enhance our understanding of potential interactions between land-use and climate change. Both these major drivers are reshaping communities by selecting for species with affinities for greater extremes in climate (Barnagaud et al. 2012 , Blois et al. 2013 , Tayleur et al. 2016 ), suggesting the likelihood of synergistic interactions. This finding improves our ability to predict how biodiversity will be reshaped by future climatic changes in a world increasingly dominated by human-disturbed land uses.",

Here, we quantified the effect of species gains and losses on the structure of whole assemblages. A key question is what mechanisms are driving the patterns we observed? In addition to changes in average temperatures, land-use change can increase the frequency of heat waves (Mishra et al. 2015) and extreme cold events (Medvigy et al. 2012) . Unlike in forests, where the buffering effect of canopies results in warmer minimum and lower maximum temperatures (Ewers and Banks-Leite 2013) , species in human-dominated land uses may not have access to the microhabitats required to avoid extreme heat and cold exposure (Kearney et al. 2009 , McNab 2012 , Sunday et al. 2014 . Our results highlight that human-dominated land uses may be particularly problematic for cold-affiliated species if they cannot tolerate or avoid the warmer temperatures, and for warm-adapted specialists if they cannot tolerate or avoid extreme cold events.",

This effect on community composition may be a consequence of direct and/or indirect effects of local climatic changes resulting from landuse change on biodiversity (Frishkoff et al. 2016 , Ogilvie et al. 2017 . Directly, changes may favour species that can tolerate the new, drier climate (Frishkoff et al. 2016) . Indirectly, the drier climatic conditions may favour vegetation that is characteristic of more arid climates, subsequently favouring species better able to exploit this vegetation (Frishkoff et al. 2016) . However, our finding that communities, on average, were affiliated with higher maximum precipitation levels in human-altered land uses was surprising, and the mechanisms underlying this trend warrant further exploration. Such an effect may arise due to differences in moisture levels, which are linked to land-use type and precipitation (Fu et al. 2003) , and may impact species' abilities to survive in certain land uses. Although, the links between land use, precipitation and moisture levels are complex due to the multitude of other factors that can influence moisture availability, such as topography, soil properties (e.g. particle size), and the plant species growing (Fu et al. 2003) . Another unexpected result was that species with drier-and narrower-than-average Pp min minimum and range-wide variation, respectively, had higher abundances in tropical croplands. It may be that species' experiencing narrower variation in minimum local precipitation levels are better able to cope with drier climates, and thus able to persist and even increase in abundance after land conversion (providing they can tolerate the other changes that occur). Although we are cautious in interpreting this result, as it is only observed in tropical croplands, it highlights the complexities underlying responses to precipitation changes. Nevertheless, our findings implicate a potentially important effect of changes in local precipitation regimes on terrestrial vertebrates.",

However, our habitat breadth index was not correlated with species' climatic affinities, and similar results were produced when forest specialists were excluded from models (Supplementary material Appendix 10).

There are at least three potential explanations for this result. First, lower seasonality in the tropics and greater historical climate stability may render species more sensitive to environmental changes and the removal of microhabitats (Janzen 1967 , Sunday et al. 2014 . Second, the weaker differences across land uses at temperate latitudes may also be because these species are not living as close to their warm tolerance thresholds (Deutsch et al. 2008 , Kearney et al. 2009 , and so can tolerate (or even benefit from) warmer temperatures (Kearney et al. 2009) . Third, the magnitude of temperature increases following conversion of primary vegetation tend to be less pronounced in northern latitudes (partly due to the greater effect of snow albedo in cleared landscapes; Alkama and Cescatti 2016, Findell et al. 2017) . Critically, the tropics hold more species, and a greater relative proportion of these species are presently threatened compared to higher latitudes (Brook et al. 2008) . Regardless of the mechanism(s), our results add to the growing number of studies highlighting the vulnerability of the tropics to global drivers of change (Brook et al. 2008) . This is an important result, given that both land-use and climate change have been projected to occur to the greatest extent and soonest within the tropics (Sala et al. 2000 , Pacifici et al. 2017 .",

Our results partly agree with these expectations, with the smallest differences in community-average climatic niche often observed between primary and advanced secondary vegetation, but not to the degree that other research suggests (particularly within the tropics). Instead, we find that the thermal niches of species within secondary vegetation can be distinguished from species found in primary vegetation, with community-average climatic niches in young secondary vegetation generally differing more than those in plantations when compared to primary vegetation.",

                "text": "Despite a prevalent use of distribution maps to describe species' realised niches and community weighted means (CWMs) to quantify changes in the structure of ecological assemblages (Barnagaud et al. 2013 , Betts et al. 2017 , Khaliq et al. 2017 , Allan et al. 2019 , Merckx and Van Dyck 2019 , Peters et al. 2019 , these methods have potential pitfalls. First, if a species is tolerant of human-altered land uses, they may be able to expand their ranges into cooler, previously uninhabitable climates, by switching habitats and colonising the warmer human-altered habitat (e.g. along elevational gradients; Frishkoff et al. 2019) . If this has happened historically, before species' ranges were mapped, calculating realised thermal niches from current distributions may lead to a too-low estimate of the minimum temperature that a species can actually tolerate. However, human-altered land uses that are unable to buffer temperatures have colder minima compared to natural vegetation (Ewers and Banks-Leite 2013, De Frenne et al. 2019) , so even if species do expand into new areas by colonising human land uses, they may still face colder extremes. Further work focusing on the propensity of species to switch habitats along climate gradients and the climatic difference populations will experience there is a key future research direction. Second, CWMs have the potential to have inflated type I error rates (Miller et al. 2019) . However, we are confident in our observations that humandominated land uses are favouring species affiliated with more extreme climates based on multiple lines of evidence. 1) The majority of our results are robust based on comparisons to null model expectations and removal of extreme data. 2) We observe consistent patterns in our abundance analyses, where we do not use CWMs, that in human-altered land uses species affiliated with lower maximum temperatures or wetter minimum precipitation levels often have lower abundances in comparison to primary vegetation than warmer-or drieraffiliated species. We urge caution however in interpreting the range-wide variation results, as these were not strongly supported with respect to null model expectations.",

These results are likely due, at least in part, to local climatic changes mediated by land-use change (either directly or indirectly), which lead to hotter local climates, changes in precipitation regimes (Frishkoff et al. 2015) and greater exposure to temperature extremes (Medvigy et al. 2012) . Our results demonstrate that land-use and climate change favour similar species, especially in the tropics, which has significant implications for the future impacts of these drivers of change. We show that minimum temperature, an often-neglected climate change variable, appears to have important impacts on community composition. Understanding the effects of land-use change, and how land use influences local climate, is key to anticipate the effects of future environmental change around the globe. This knowledge can also help us to design appropriate and effective management schemes to mitigate shifts in local climatic conditions through restoring and incorporating natural climate refugia into altered landscapes.",
