On page one of the September 1, 1943, issue of the Fort Smith (Ar.. kansas) Times Record there appeared a story of the capture of an armadillo on the farm of J. H. Robinson, east of Van Buren, Crawford County, Arkansas. The story was accompanied by an excellent photograph. The present record is neither as far north nor as far east as certain of the records reported by Dellinger and Black but it does add evidence tha.t these records are based on a natural extension of range of the armadillo. This latest specimen appears to have been a wild animal and lends support to records and repo~ts that the armadillo is becoming fairly well established in the Arkansas River ",
