    "abstract": "AGE VARIATION IN PEROMYSCUS MANICULATUS GRACILIS By LEE R. DICE In earlier studies (Dice, 1932, pp. 13-14; 1933a, p. 7) it has been shown that in two subspecies of deer-mice, Peromyscus rnaniculatus bairdii and P. m. rufinus, there is a considerable amount of growth of body and skeleton after the mice are one year old. Mice of these. two subspecies averaging two years of age are larger in every measurement than those averaging one year of age. OD the other hand, no appreciable difference in pelage color was found between one-year old and two-year old mice. There now are available a few specimens of another subspecies, Peromyscus maniculatus gracilis, over two years of age, and it therefore can be determined whether or not growth in these mice continues during the second year of life and later. The stock of gracilis was trapped in 1923 in virgin hardwood forest 5 miles south of Elmira, Otsego County, Michigan; Three males and 3 females became the parents of a small stock, and there was some inbreeding. The available number of specimens of the one-year age-class is only 6, and no attempt has been made to use these first-year specimens in comparisons of the \u2022body measurements, although they are used in the averages of the tint photometer readings. Of the two-year age-class 19 specimens are at hand from mice killed at an average age of 101 (83-124) weeks. I have combined the averages for the three-year and older age-classes. Of these there are available 30 specimens; 22 from mice killed when 3 years old, 7 from mice 4 years old, and 1 from a mouse 5 years old, the average ages of all being 169 (132-252) weeks. This stock of mice was collected by an expedition supported by the Michigan Department of Conservation. The cost of rearing the animals was borne in part by the Museum of Zoology and in part by grants from the Faculty Research Fund of the University of Michigan. All of the body measurements have been taken by myself. The skeletons were measured by R. M. Bailey and the tint photometer readings were made by Sherman Hoslett. The statistical computations have been made by Margaret Liebe and myself. BODY MEASUREMENTS ,. In every body measurement the mice of the three-to five-year age-class average larger than the mice of the two-year age-class, indicating growth in body size after the second year of life (see table 1). The difference in body length between these age classes is not significant, but in all the other body measurements the differences are statistically important. In tail length the difference between the age classes is 7.80 \u00b11.28 mm., a difference 6.1 times its probable error. The hind foot of the females averages 0.919 \u00b10.197 mm.longer, and of the males 0.5 \u00b1O.189 mm.longer in the older class, differences which are respectively 4.7 and 2.7 times their probable errors. The ear averages 1.258 \u00b10.142 mm. longer in the mice of the older age class, a difference 8.9 times its probable error.",
