The eight Lower Keys specimens were compared to ca. 300 other Sylvilagus, including 233 S. palustris. Student's t-test was used on quantitative data; the 95 percent level of confidence was accepted as significant. I followed the method of Hall (1981) in separating the sexes and juveniles from adults (using the criteria of Hoffmeister and Zimmerman, 1967) . All 30 cranial characters listed by Diersing (1978) were considered and I added four more: condylobasallength; length of the dentary (or mandibular) symphysis; and two zygomatic breadths. Zygomatic breadth was measured anteriorly, at the step of the maxillary, at the midpoint, where squamosal and jugal meet, and posterioriy at the level of the lateral base of the T-shaped squamosal. Four characters regarded as of subgeneric value by Hershkovitz (1950) were notcd but not quantified: shape of the basisphenoid; size of the sphenopalatine vacuily; distance between posteroventral condylar edges relative to basisphenoid-basioccipital suture; and relative lengths of digits three and four of pes (degree of perissodactyly), Dorsal skull sculpture was examined.",

                "text": "All continental populations of S. palustris tend to be reddish. There is no significant difference in external measurements between the subspecies, and both attain far greater size than given by Hall (1981) sandy, usually with a reddish tint; ventrally gray, similarly colored on belly, thighs, and tail; molariform toothrow short, usually less than 14.7, but about the same length as dentary symphysis; frontonasal profile flat, frontonasal height about the same as molariform row; cranium narrow, less than twice length of molariform toothrow; parietals usually lightly sculptured, this sculpture sometimes extending onto frontals, but not nasals. Lyon (1904) placed the species palustris in his genus Limnolagus and separated it from Sylvilagus sensu stricto on the bases of larger choanae, reduced anterior process of the supraorbital, and fused posterior process of the supraorbital. Lyon's Limnolagus included the species aquaticus and brasiliensis, as those are now understood. This nominal genus did not include the European Oryctolagus, which agreed in size of choanae, because Oryctolagus agreed with Sylvilagus (and Brachylagus) in supraorbital characters. As long as one maintained at least the three genera Limnolagus, Sylvilagus sensu stricto, and Oryctolagus, definitions separating them could be phrased. However, Hershkovitz (1950) showed Limnolagus to be a polyphyletic assemblage, invalid as a genus. He erected subgenus Paludilagus for s. palus/ris. However, he did not consider what dismantling Limnolagus and merging it with Sylvilagus-both highly desirable aClions-did to Oryctolagus. There is now no way to separate at the generic level the species originally found in Europe from the species found in the Americas. Sylvilagus cuniculus, albeit exotic in North America, is a widespread wild or feral species. It occurs in the wild from New England to the Lower Keys (pers. obs.) and may be found in sympatry with S. p. hefneri (YPM 08926, Sugarloaf Key).",
