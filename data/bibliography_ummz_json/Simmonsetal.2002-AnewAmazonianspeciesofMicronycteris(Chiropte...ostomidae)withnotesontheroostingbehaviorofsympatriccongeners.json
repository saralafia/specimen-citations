Simmons and Voss (1998) and Wetterer et al. (2000) concluded that this assemblage was not monophyletic, and argued that the subgenera of Micronycteris recognized by Simmons (1996) should be elevated to generic rank in order to achieve a phylogenetic classification. This change resulted in the recognition of four genera in addition to Micronycteris (sensu stricto): Glyphonycteris Thomas, Lampronycteris Sanborn, Neonycteris Sanborn, and Trinycteris Sanborn. So restricted, Micronycteris now includes eight species: hirsuta Peters, megalotis Gray, microtis Miller, brosseti Simmons and Voss, sanborni Simmons, schmidtorum Sanborn, minuta Gervais, and homezi Pirlot. Although no phylogenetic study to date has included all of these species, recent analyses of morphological data (Simmons, 1996; Wetterer et al., 2000) and DNA sequences (Baker et al., 2000) from various subsets of congeneric taxa suggest that Micronycteris (sensu stricto) is monophyletic.",

Several well-sampled local faunas include both dark-bellied species (hirsuta, megalotis, microtis) and pale-bellied forms (brosseti, sanborni, schmidtorum, minuta, homezi) , but the ecobehavioral significance (if any) of this chromatic distinction is unknown. In fact, very little is known about the natural history of Micronycteris species, in large part because they are not commonly captured by mistnetting (the preferred bat-collecting method of most Neotropical mammalogists; Voss and Emmons, 1996) .",

Local habitats sampled by mistnetting included gardens and clearings around Matses houses, secondary growth (abandoned swiddens), well-drained primary forest, aguajales (Mauritia flexuosa palm swamps), and river beaches. Under the forest canopy, mistnets were usually deployed in linear (tandem) arrays along existing trails or in specially cut net lanes, but right-angled or other configurations were sometimes used. Nets were opened just before dark (often when it was still light enough to read), and were tended continuously until they were closed (usually before midnight).

DESCRIPTION AND COMPARISON: Micronycteris matses is a medium-sized member of the genus, smaller than hirsuta but larger than microtis and megalotis (tables 1-3). From all other dark-bellied congeners, matses can be unambiguously distinguished on the basis of forearm length, greatest length of skull, condylo-incisive length, postorbital breadth, mastoid breadth, zygomatic breadth, maxillary toothrow length, and breadth across molars. Additionally, matses can be distinguished from hirsuta on the basis of total length, tibia length, and thumb length; from microtis on the basis of weight and total length; and from megalotis on the basis of weight, hindfoot length, and tibia length. Micronycteris matses is larger than all pale-bellied congeners (brosseti, schmidtorum, homezi, minuta, sanborni; see measurements summarized by Simmons [1996] and Simmons and Voss [1998] ) in most anatomical dimensions. As in all Micronycteris, the dorsal pelage of matses is composed of bicolored hairs with white bases and brown tips. In the upper back region, the white base comprises no more than one-fourth of the length of each hair. This is comparable to the pattern seen in hirsuta, but differs from that seen in most other species. The white bases comprise between one-fourth and one-half of each hair on the upper back in microtis, megalotis, Measurements a of the Type Series of Micronycteris matses brosseti, schmidtorum, and homezi, and are even more extensive in minuta (comprising one-half to two-thirds of each hair) and sanborni (two-thirds to three-fourths of each hair). The length of the dorsal fur over the upper back in matses is approximately 7-8 mm, comparable to that of microtis, brosseti, and homezi. In contrast, minuta and sanborni have shorter fur over the shoulders (5-7 mm), whereas megalotis, schmidtorum, and hirsuta have longer fur (8-11 mm in the former two species, 11-14 mm in the latter).",

By contrast, p3 is relatively larger (approximately the same size as p4) in both microtis and megalotis; in these taxa, p2 is often slightly larger than either p3 or p4, although there is some within-species variation in this trait (all three lower premolars are subequal in some individuals). In brosseti and schmidtorum, p2 and p4 are subequal in length and in height, whereas p3 is slightly smaller in both dimensions. In minuta, sanborni, and homezi, p3 is further reduced relative to p2 and p4, which are large and subequal.",

Five bats were Roosts Inhabited by Micronycteris matses and Sympatric Amazonian Congeners a observed hanging together from the roof of this tunnel on 16 September 1999, of which only one (an adult female Micronycteris matses, AMNH 273095) was collected. Roost 95. Described by the Matses collector as ''a hole in the ground that one could stand in'', in a stream headwater gully in primary floodplain forest (seasonally inundated by the G\u00e1lvez, but dry at the time of collection). Many bats were observed to inhabit this roost on 6 October 1999, of which only two could be collected; both were Micronycteris matses, one an adult male (AMNH 273133), the other an adult female (MUSM 15229). Roost 161. A hole eroded in the side of a stream headwater gully in primary upland (unflooded) forest. About seven bats were observed in this roost on 9 November 1999, of which four were shot. All of the shot bats appeared to be conspecific, but two (an unsexed adult and a juvenile) were too damaged to preserve as specimens. The voucher material from this roost therefore consists of just two individuals, one adult female Micronycteris matses (AMNH 273196) and the adult male holotype (MUSM 15231).",

First, our capture records for Micronycteris matses (one in mistnets, seven at roosts) are similar to the pattern we recorded for other congeneric species at Nuevo San Juan and elsewhere in Amazonia (table 4) . In general, species of Micronycteris are more commonly encountered by searching for diurnal roosts than by mistnetting, a fact that perhaps accounts for the small numbers of these bats routinely taken by inventory workers who rely principally on the latter method to sample Neotropical chiropteran faunas. The adoption of intensive roost-searching protocols by future inventory projects will doubtless result in more captures of M. matses, which is perhaps widely distributed in Amazonia.",

All of the roosts occupied by M. matses were probably excavated (or enlarged) by the giant long-nosed armadillo (Dasypus kappleri), an important game species esteemed by the Matses, who identify stream headwater gullies as a favored site for burrow construction (Fleck and Harder, 2000) . By contrast, no other Micronycteris species used this type of roost exclusively at Nuevo San Juan, and none used such refugia at Paracou, another Amazonian locality where we found many Micronycteris roosts. Roosts typically inhabited by other congeneric species are rotted cavities in logs or standing trees, but M. microtis was sometimes found in holes in the ground (usually armadillo burrows) at Nuevo San Juan.",
