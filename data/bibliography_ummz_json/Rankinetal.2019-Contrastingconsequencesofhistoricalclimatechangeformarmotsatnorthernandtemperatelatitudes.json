    "abstract": "Many species that occupy high latitudes of North America were historically restricted to relatively small refugia during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). The geographic ranges of many of these species then expanded widely across the continent after glacial ice receded. In contrast, species whose LGM distributions spanned lower (relatively ice-free) latitudes may have been less likely to experience demographic and geographic retraction during glacial periods, or expansion during interglacial periods. For example, species in North America's Intermountain West occupied a topographically complex landscape across which widespread patches of suitable habitat could have helped maintain a relatively stable range-wide effective population size even if local populations fluctuated in response to shifting climates. We test for these alternative demographic signals in southern versus northern species by comparing patterns of genetic diversity of the more southern yellow-bellied marmot (Marmota flaviventris) with those of the more northern hoary marmot (M. caligata). Our data reveal high diversity but no deep structure across the distribution of yellow-bellied marmots. In contrast, hoary marmots have previously been shown to exhibit a deep divergence between regional mitochondrial clades of relatively low diversity. We suggest that these differences reflect differences in habitat availability through time, with hoary marmots persistently isolated in small glacial refugia and yellow-bellied marmots more broadly distributed across the Intermountain West through both glacial and interglacial periods. Our results highlight the importance of historical patterns of habitat availability as key drivers of current genetic structure.",

For example, many montane (mountain-dwelling) species occupying this region probably had relatively broad and continuous distributions during glacial stages, and more restricted and fragmented distributions during interglacials (Haubrich and Schmitt 2007; Galbreath et al. 2009) . There is evidence that continuous woodland habitats spanned the Intermountain West periodically during the Wisconsin glacial period (Wells 1983; Grayson 2011) , which spanned 110-12 Ka, when global cooling drove the formation of continental ice sheets that engulfed northern latitudes. Geographic range expansion in response to climate cooling was probably a generalized response for many species of montane plants and animals. However, as these species tracked the geographic shifts of their climate envelope during warmer interglacial periods, populations fragmented across the topographically complex Intermountain West (Guralnick 2007) . Though such fragmentation may have been accompanied by localized population reductions, it would have preserved diversity across the full range of a species by capturing local variation within population isolates. Thus, fragmentation is expected to result in the maintenance of a relatively high long-term effective population size in comparison to species that were historically restricted to a single small refugium, as we would not anticipate species-wide bottlenecks during the LGM for persistently widespread species. Coalescence times would be expected to pre-date the LGM as a diversity of alleles are preserved locally in separate population isolates.",

                "text": "The different effects of glacial and interglacial transitions for species occupying both northern and temperate latitudes can be investigated by contrasting the phylogeographic histories of populations spanning these regions. For example, a multilocus study of the long-tailed vole (Microtus longicaudus), a species whose distribution extends from Alaska to New Mexico, identified four geographic phylogroups that exhibited a latitudinal trend of diversity, with the lowest diversity in the northern phylogroup and the highest diversity in the southern phylogroup (Sawyer and Cook 2016) . This pattern is consistent with northern clades experiencing reduced ancestral population sizes followed by expansion, and southern clades representing historically stable populations. Relatively few species maintain widespread geographic distributions spanning both high and low latitudes, but contrasts within pairs of closely related northern and southern taxa may offer insights into the consequences of environmental change along the latitudinal gradient. For example, the high-latitude collared pika (Ochotona collaris) exhibits a lack of phylogeographic structure and a signature of past population expansion (Lanier and Olson 2013) , whereas its low-latitude sister, the American pika (O. princeps), is composed of five deeply divergent phylogroups (Galbreath et al. 2009) , whose histories hint at a more complex history of expansion during the LGM and subsequent contraction. Thus, populations of the high-latitude species are less geographically structured and more closely related than are populations of the low-latitude species, suggesting a history in which successive range contractions during glacial events and expansion during glacial retreat greatly reduced genetic diversity in the north. Conversely, patterns of diversity in the southern species are consistent with a model of more widespread habitat persistence, in which stable population isolates allowed old alleles to persist (Galbreath et al. 2009) . This result is consistent with the observation that although the Intermountain West experienced a cooler and dryer climate during glacial periods, most of the region was not inundated by extensive continental ice sheets, as was the case further north.",

                "text": "Here, we compare responses of two species of marmots (genus Marmota) in the subgenus Petromarmota to the climate cycles of the Quaternary. We focus on three clades of interest: 1) the yellow-bellied marmot (M. flaviventris), 2) the coastal hoary marmot, and 3) the continental hoary marmot (M. caligata; see Kerhoulas et al. 2015) . Both M. flaviventris ( Fig. 1A) and M. caligata (Fig. 1B) are associated with colder climates, but the latter is currently widespread within higher latitudes while the former is found in North American mountains at middle latitudes. Because these different regions of North America were impacted by glacial periods in different ways, our goal was to compare the two species genetically and assess whether their demographic history and current genetic structure was shaped by species-specific patterns of habitat availability during the glacial and interglacial periods of the Quaternary. Previous work by Kerhoulas et al. (2015) suggested that M. caligata, which currently occupies areas that were glaciated and now are inhabitable, had its range greatly reduced south of the ice sheets. They found that the species is subdivided into two mitochondrial (mtDNA) clades, one of which has the Vancouver Island marmot (M. vancouverensis) as sister, and concluded that these clades diverged in periglacial refugia in the Rocky Mountains (hoary continental) and Coast-Cascade Mountains (hoary coastal), probably during or prior to the mid-Pleistocene, before expanding northward as glaciers retreated following the LGM (Brunsfeld et al. 2001; Kerhoulas et al. 2015) . In contrast, current understanding of intraspecific variation in yellow-bellied marmots is based entirely on morphological data (Howell 1915; Frase and Hoffmann 1980; Armitage 2005) , and the phylogeographic history of the species has not been investigated. However, it is likely that M. flaviventris, whose range was not physically restricted by ice sheets, was more broadly distributed during glacial periods, with extensive gene flow among populations.",

Because the current phylogeographic structure of M. caligata was shaped by habitat retraction during past glacial events, and its current distribution has been established via post-LGM patterns of habitat availability, we predicted its two clades to exhibit 1) coalescence times coincident with the LGM, and 2) a signal of post-LGM population growth. For yellow-bellied marmots, the expectation that the species persisted across mountain systems of the Intermountain West throughout glacial periods predicts 1) a demographic signal of a relatively large and stable longterm population size, and 2) an estimate of time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) that predates the LGM. This would be the case if the amount of available Pleistocene habitat were large, and the species did not experience strong bottlenecks during Pleistocene glaciations.",

Partial sequences from the mitochondrial cytochromeb (Cytb) gene and adjacent control region were obtained from GenBank for hoary marmot (M. caligata, n = 167), Olympic marmot (M. olympus, n = 5), and Vancouver Island marmot (M. vancouverensis, n = 4), as well as two M. flaviventris sequences from Idaho (see Kerhoulas et al. 2015 ; Cytb: KJ458055-KJ458232, KJ458071-KJ458074; control region: KJ457704-KJ457876, KJ458411-KJ458415). These four species are closely related and comprise the subgenus Petromarmota; M. flaviventris is the sister species of the clade containing the other three (Kruckenhauser et al. 1999; Steppan et al. 1999 Steppan et al. , 2011 Kerhoulas et al. 2015) . Moreover, we collected hair samples from yellow-bellied marmots on several mountain ranges in central Nevada, the East River Valley in the Elk Range of the Colorado Rocky Mountains, the White Mountains in California, and the Stansbury Mountains in Utah. Samples from the White Mountains and Rocky Mountains were plucked from live-trapped marmots while samples from central Nevada, the Deep Creek Range, and Stansbury Mountains were collected using hair snares or by collecting shed hairs from rocks around marmot burrows (Floyd et al. 2005) . When shed hairs were collected, only one follicle per burrow complex was used, which prevented sampling of an individual more than once. A spreadsheet of hair sample locality information is included as Supplementary Data SD1. All capture and handling conformed to animal care and use guidelines established by the American Society of Mammalogists (Sikes et al. 2016) . We obtained additional frozen or ethanol-preserved tissue and dry skin samples for yellow-bellied marmots from natural history museum collections (Appendix I). These specimens originated from California (13), Colorado (2), Idaho (2), Montana (3), Nevada (5), New Mexico (1), Utah (7), Washington (6), and Wyoming (12). DNA was extracted from hair follicles using a modified Chelex method (Taberlet et al. 1997; Floyd et al. 2005) , and a DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, California) was used to extract DNA from museum specimens according to the manufacturer's protocols. Handling and processing of hair follicles, dried skin, and liver tissue were each carried out in separate laboratories. All equipment and surfaces were sterilized before an extraction with 10% bleach, and each extraction included a negative control (no tissue) to check for exogenous contamination from the extraction procedure. Homologous sequences of the mitochondrial Cytb gene and mitochondrial control region were amplified from individual specimens using the primers CB3R and 12SAR (Palumbi 1996) . Polymerase Chain Reactions (PCR) were carried out in 50-\u00b5l reactions containing 3 \u00b5l DNA, 37.75 \u00b5l water, 5 \u00b5l PCR buffer, 1 \u00b5l of 25 mM MgCl 2 , 1 \u00b5l of 10 mM dNTPs, 1 \u00b5l each of 10 mM forward and reverse primer, and 0.25 \u00b5l of 5U/\u00b5l of New England Biolabs Taq polymerase, and one in every eight reactions was a negative control. The PCR reactions consisted of an initial denaturation step at 95\u00b0 for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles of a denaturation step at 95\u00b0 for 35 s, an annealing step at 49.5\u00b0 for 60 s, and an elongation step at 72\u00b0 for 45 s, and finalized with a final extension step at 72\u00b0 for 5 min. Amplicons were electrophoresed in a 1% agarose gel to verify the amplifications and cleaned using the Qiaquick PCR cleanup kit (Qiagen). Sequencing was performed by GeneWiz, Inc. (http://www.genewiz.com/) using PCR product normalized at 20 ng/\u00b5l for each sample. PCR products were sequenced in both the forward and reverse directions, and consensus sequences were produced using Geneious v7.1 (Drummond et al. 2011) . No indels or premature stop codons were found in the Cytb region of the data set. New sequences have been deposited in GenBank (KU199771-KU199801, HM050297-HM050301, GQ451911-GQ451948, KX220091-KX220092, MK334254-MK334269, MK421575). To serve as outgroups, one homologous sequence each was also obtained from GenBank for the Himalayan marmot (M. himalayana; NC018367), alpine marmot (M. marmota; GCA001458135), and steppe marmot (M. bobak; AF143917/AY788909). The Himalayan, alpine, and steppe marmot are members of the subgenus Marmota, which is sister to the subgenus Petromarmota (Kruckenhauser et al. 1999; Steppan et al. 1999 Steppan et al. , 2011 . Sequence alignment was performed using MAFFT (Katoh et al. 2002 ) online (http://www. ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/mafft/) and the subsequent alignment was checked and edited by eye using MEGA6 (Tamura et al. 2013 ); a nexus file of the aligned sequence data is included as Supplementary Data SD2.",

Smooth, unimodal mismatch distributions are indicative of recent population expansion, whereas ragged distributions suggest population stability or contraction (Slatkin and Hudson 1991; Rogers and Harpending 1992) .",

                "text": "Species distribution model.-To examine the potential relationship between genetic diversity and current predicted habitat and predicted LGM habitat in M. flaviventris and M. caligata, we prepared ensemble species distribution models (SDMs-Peterson 2011) for the two species, projecting them onto both current and LGM climate conditions. This approach allowed us to evaluate how temporal patterns of habitat availability could explain differences in current genetic diversity between M. flaviventris and M. caligata. We acquired georeferenced locality records for yellow-bellied marmots and hoary marmots from GBIF (www.gbif.org; accessed 4 November 2018) and previously published studies (Floyd 2004; Kerhoulas et al. 2015) , as well as 19 standard bioclimatic variables obtained from WORLDCLIM (Hijmans et al. 2005 ; resolution: 2.5 arc min). As removing spatially autocorrelated points has been shown to improve the performance of presence-only modeling methods (Boria et al. 2014) , locality data were thinned using the R package spThin to randomly remove points from pairs that fell within a 5-km radius. The thinning process was iterated 1,000 times and the results that retained the most localities were used for calculating SDMs for the two marmot species. After thinning, there remained 890 locality points for M. flaviventris ( Fig. 1A ; Supplementary Data SD3) and 330 points for M. caligata ( Fig. 1B; Supplementary Data SD4) . In addition, we selected a subset of 10 minimally correlated (Pearson's correlation coefficient < 0.80) bioclimatic variables to include in models to describe the suitable climate of each species and to allow for comparisons across species. Selected variables included the following: BIO2 = mean diurnal range, BIO3 = isothermality, BIO5 = maximum temperature of warmest month, BIO6 = minimum temperature of coldest month, BIO7 = temperature annual range, BIO8 = mean temperature of wettest quarter, BIO9 = mean temperature of driest quarter, BIO13 = precipitation of wettest month, BIO14 = precipitation of driest month, and BIO15 = precipitation seasonality. The modeling was done using a working area polygon of 72\u00b0-20\u00b0 latitude and 180\u00b0-100\u00b0 longitude for both M. flaviventris and M. caligata. We set the working area polygon to include only western North America to avoid sampling background points from areas that fall well outside the species' known geographic distribution. We constructed SDMs using the ensemble method implemented in the R (R Development Core Team 2009) package biomod2 (Thuiller et al. 2009) , which included nine modeling methods used to calculate separate SDMs: Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Boosted Regression Trees (GBM), Generalized Additive Model (GAM), Classification Tree Analysis (CTA), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Surface Range Envelop (SRE), Flexible Discriminant Analysis (FDA), Multiple Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), and Random Forest (RF). For each method, we used the default settings in biomod2 because these settings are optimized for SDM, and we randomly sampled 10,000 pseudoabsences from the focal region using the \"random\" strategy available in BioMod. We used 75% of our data for training models and 25% for testing, and 10 replicates for each model to evaluate model performance. The accuracy of the model performance was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Area under the ROC curve (AUC) values range from 0 to 1, with values closer to 1 indicating a better fitting performance, and AUC > 0.5 suggests nonrandom discrimination for that given model. Finally, we built an ensemble model ignoring models with an ROC of < 0.80 and weighting all other models by ROC score and forecasting the ensemble model onto current climate conditions. We also projected a paleodistribution using the same methods and 10 bioclimatic variables estimated for the LGM (~26.5 Ka) under the community climate system model (CCM3- Collins et al. 2006) .",

The skyline plot recovered a deep trend of long-term stability, followed by a recent signal of precipitous decline (Fig. 4) . Shallower coalescences and a smaller effective population size were calculated for both hoary marmot clades. In the continental and coastal clades, we calculated mean root heights of 0.16 Ma (95% HPD = 0.06 \u2212 0.30) and 0.14 Ma (95% HPD = 0.054 \u2212 0.25), respectively. The skyline plots for the hoary clades show a general pattern of demographic stability at smaller effective population sizes relative to that calculated for the yellow-bellied marmot (Fig. 4) . However, broad HPD intervals in all skyline plots indicate that details of demographic history should be interpreted with caution. Haplotype diversity values for M. flaviventris and the two hoary marmot clades are similar (Table 1) , but nucleotide diversity in M. flaviventris is roughly 5.7 times greater than that of either clade of the hoary marmot (Table 1 ). This pattern suggests that genetic diversity in the modern population of yellow-bellied marmot populations accumulated over a deeper time frame than that of the hoary marmot lineages. Marmota flaviventris shows a ragged, multimodal mismatch distribution (Fig. 5 ) and a Tajima's D statistic that does not differ significantly from theoretical expectations based on a stable population (Table 1) . In contrast, the two hoary marmot clades show more strongly negative Tajima's D values (Table 1 ) and relatively unimodal mismatch distributions (Fig. 5) , which are more consistent with populations that experienced recent rapid growth.",

The yellow-bellied marmot inhabits meadows, valleys, and steppes at elevations of about 1,800 \u2212 4,000 m throughout western North America, and occurs from southern British Columbia and Alberta in Canada to much of the western United States, including the Sierra Nevada, Great Basin, Columbia Plateau, and Rocky Mountains (Hall 1959; Armstrong 1972) . Results for LGM conditions show areas of high suitability across much of California, Nevada, and Oregon and parts of Idaho, Utah, Colorado, and Arizona (Fig. 6C) . Although more restricted in northern and eastern regions when compared to current conditions, the LGM-predicted areas of suitable conditions span a broad geographic area that is comparable in size to the area currently occupied, which is consistent with the findings of Polly et al. (2015) . The projection of the M. caligata SDM onto current climatic conditions also shows that areas of high occurrence probability closely match the known species distribution (Fig. 6B) , which includes areas from the Yukon River in Alaska south through northwest Canada and the United States, including northern Washington, Idaho, and Montana, mostly in rocky alpine meadows up to 2,500 m, although some populations also occur near seal level in coastal British Columbia and Alaska (Karels et al. 2004; Gunderson et al. 2009; Braun et al. 2011) . However, in contrast to M. flaviventris, and consistent with the findings of Polly et al.

                "text": "The glacial history of North America has had contrasting population genetic consequences for yellow-bellied marmots and hoary marmots. For M. flaviventris, a lack of strong phylogeographic structure across western North America coupled with an early Pleistocene TMRCA suggests a history of population connectivity across the region that deeply predates the LGM. In contrast, deeply divergent, regionally distributed clades identified in hoary marmots (Kerhoulas et al. 2015 ) probably reflect population isolation within discrete refugia during past glacial events. Both clades of hoary marmots exhibit coalescence times that fall during the late Pleistocene, and though all credibility intervals for TMRCA estimates are broad, intervals for the two hoary clades do not overlap with that of M. flaviventris. The depth of coalescence within yellow-bellied marmots is more similar to interspecific divergences between three other marmot species-M. olympus and M. caligata-M. vancouverensis-placing the origin of the M. flaviventris lineage in the early Pleistocene and indicating that the species has persisted in the complex western landscape of North America through several glacial and interglacial transitions ( Fig. 3 ; Supplementary Data SD6). Relative stability and connectivity of yellow-bellied marmot populations across the region allowed a large effective population size to persist and both old and new diversity to be retained. In contrast, the hoary clades and their close relatives represent smaller populations that probably underwent rapid lineage sorting due to bottlenecks caused by range retraction into isolated periglacial refugia. If such population retraction during the LGM was particularly severe, this would predict the TMRCA for refugial isolates to coincide with the LGM. The fact that clade coalescence times precede the LGM could either reflect ambiguity in the molecular clock calibration or indicate that the inferred bottlenecks were incomplete, permitting a limited pool of ancestral diversity to persist within the refugia. However, evolutionary rates differ over time and among genes, and a caveat of our study is that our dating estimates are based on a single locus. There is potential to more thoroughly examine these intraspecific divergence events using genomic methods like UCEs or ddRADseq, in which it is customary to estimate the time for each locus separately and then use the average for all loci as the final estimate or use genetic distances based on concatenated sequences. It is likely that yellow-bellied marmots had access to more Pleistocene habitat during cold phases, which would have facilitated both population stability and connectivity. Our SDMs showed considerable overlap between distributions of M. flaviventris under glacial (LGM) and interglacial (current) conditions, which would permit maintenance of a high and stable species-wide population over time. Indeed, our demographic analysis indicates that M. flaviventris experienced demographic stability through the late Pleistocene, although a signal of population decline during the Holocene departs from this trend. The SDMs are also consistent with paleontological evidence that suggests that during the LGM the distribution of yellowbellied marmots shifted to lower latitudes and elevations and became less patchy relative to current conditions (Grayson 2011) . For example, yellow-bellied marmots once occupied the Mojave Desert of California (Goodwin 1989; Stegner 2015) , far southern Nevada (Grayson 1987 (Grayson , 2011 , Arizona (Lange 1956) , southern New Mexico (Schultz et al. 1935; Stearns 1942; Harris and Findley 1964) , Texas (Harris 1990) , and parts of northern Mexico (Ceballos et al. 2010) . Approximately 11 Ka, the lower and southern boundaries of these distributions began to retract as M. flaviventris shifted into higher elevations and latitudes. This shift was associated with declines in abundance and increasingly fragmented distributions during the Holocene (Grayson 1987 (Grayson , 2011 , which may account for the signature of recent demographic decline. The lack of evidence of fluctuations in earlier glacial-interglacial cycles is not unexpected given that BSPs generally do not record fluctuation over deep time due to the relative paucity of coalescent events in the deeper past relative to more recent times.",

These refugia include parts of Vancouver Island, the Coast-Cascade Mountains, the Oregon High Desert, the Grand Coulee region, the Snake and Columbia river valleys, and Glacial Lake Missoula. Physiographic barriers of the region may partially explain why the hoary marmot apparently did not expand in range during the last glacial period, but it is also possible that hoary marmots are more specialized to alpine habitats and therefore ecologically restricted in their tolerances. Survival of hoary marmots in the Yukon Territory, Canada, was found to be strongly associated with winter condition, in which hibernation survival was highest when there was deep snowpack, below-average temperatures, and late snowmelt (Patil 2013) . This finding could indicate that hoary marmots are dependent on the depth and duration of snowpack, and areas that provided optimal winter conditions may have been limited at the southern extent of their glacial-age distributions. However, it has been suggested that the current range boundaries of M. caligata may be defined by other factors in addition to climate, such as vegetation, substrate, and competition with other marmots (Polly et al. 2015) . Where the ranges of M. caligata and M. flaviventris overlap in the northern Rockies, the two are separated by elevation (Frase and Hoffmann 1980; Barash 1989) , and Polly et al. (2015) also suggested competition between M. caligata and the woodchuck (M. monax) as a limiting factor. Thus, it is plausible that competitive interactions with other marmots may have also limited M. caligata's glacial-age distribution.",

For example, the Columbia Basin in Washington, Klamath Gap in Oregon, and Wyoming Basin in Wyoming are low-elevation zones that represent physiographic barriers to dispersal for many high-elevation species (Soltis et al. 1997; Brunsfeld et al. 2001; Demboski and Cook 2001; Carstens et al. 2005; DeChaine and Martin 2005; Wilson et al. 2005; Albach et al. 2006) . Small mammals such as yellow-pine chipmunks (Tamias amoenus- Demboski and Sullivan 2003) , western jumping mice (Zapus princeps- Malaney et al. 2013) , and bushy-tailed woodrats (Neotoma cinerea-Hornsby and Matocq 2012) exhibit phylogeographic patterns that reflect long periods of isolation without mixing of lineages. The American pika, which has a distribution that broadly overlaps that of M. flaviventris, has five allopatric mtDNA lineages associated with separate mountain provinces. These phylogeographic groups probably arose because of regional isolation across low-elevation zones that were inhospitable during interglacial periods, coupled with population expansion during glacial phases that encouraged genetic admixture within regional mountain systems (Galbreath et al. 2009 (Galbreath et al. , 2010 . However, evidence for strong structure in American pikas at regional scales does not preclude the possibility of historical contact between regional phylogroups when conditions favored dispersal (i.e., during glacial periods). Signatures of limited gene flow at lineage edges (Galbreath et al. 2010) and apparent historical dispersal by pika-specific parasites across lineage boundaries (Galbreath and Hoberg 2015) indicate that expansion of regional populations during past glacial periods created opportunities for inter-montane dispersal for this (and presumably other) alpine-associated species. A lack of regional structure in yellow-bellied marmots is consistent with such a history of connectivity among mountain systems.",

Although yellow-bellied marmots frequently coexist with American pikas and other subalpine organisms in talus slopes near timberline-a region of presumably restricted niche opportunities-modern populations of M. flaviventris are commonly found in relatively warm and arid low-elevation habitats (Frase and Hoffmann 1980) , including developed areas of Reno, Nevada (C. H. Floyd, pers. obs.) . Even across the central Great Basin, where island-like mountain ranges are separated by arid valleys, yellow-bellied marmots show patterns of genetic structure that are consistent with gene flow between the ranges (Floyd et al. 2005) . Where both M. flaviventris and M. caligata occur in some parts of Washington, Idaho, and Montana, M. flaviventris is restricted to lower elevations and the higher elevations are inhabited by M. caligata (Frase and Hoffmann 1980; Barash 1989) . This partitioning of habitats may reflect greater specialization on alpine environments by M. caligata. Yellow-bellied marmots, therefore, may not be as restricted as other co-distributed mammals by the lowelevation, xeric regions that separate mountain ranges of the Intermountain West. Indeed, M. flaviventris appears to be more tolerant of warm, lowland habitat and, unlike M. caligata, it should not be considered representative of alpine mammals in general.",

The perceived insularity of these montane mammal populations has conservation implications because the area of available habitat for these mammals is expected to shrink as their associated climate envelopes shift upslope, and the more isolated a population is, the less likely it is to be rescued or recolonized by immigrants. The arid lowlands that separate the relatively cool, mesic habitats occupied by montane mammals are generally thought to constitute formidable obstacles to intermountain dispersal for montane mammals (Brown 1971; Waltari and Guralnick 2009) , and models based on island biogeographic principles often predict that increased warming will cause local extinctions of boreal mammals and some ranges will lose a large proportion of their current faunas (McDonald and Brown 1992) . However, the assumption of minimal dispersal among mountain ranges is not supported for M. flaviventris by the results of our study and those of Floyd et al. (2005) . Gene flow by yellow-bellied marmots across arid lowland regions surrounding montane ranges appears to have occurred historically (this study) and is ongoing (Floyd et al. 2005) . In this respect, we hypothesize that M. flaviventris will be relatively tolerant of the effects of climatic warming, compared to species that are more dependent on cool, mesic habitats, such as pikas (Beever et al. 2003 (Beever et al. , 2011 .",

For the southerly distributed yellow-bellied marmots, habitat remained widely available across temperate latitudes throughout the Pleistocene, as they maintained large and stable populations and supported connectivity that resisted the establishment of discrete phylogeographic units. The fact that M. flaviventris today can thrive along an elevation gradient spanning from the sagebrush-dominated foothills to the alpine zone suggests a physiological flexibility that would have promoted the maintenance of genetic diversity and gene flow over glacial-interglacial periodicity.",

Most of the hoary marmot's extensive current distribution necessarily was acquired during postglacial expansion from these southern refugia. Sequential bottlenecking resulting from serial establishment of small founder populations would have led to a loss of diversity (\"pioneer\" dispersal- Hewitt 1996 Hewitt , 2000 , resulting in the starkly different population genetic structure of M. caligata relative to M. flaviventris. While current diversity in hoary marmots was largely shaped by glacial-age events of the late Pleistocene, the phylogenetic depth and diversity of M. flaviventris is the result of deeper historical factors, potentially reaching back to the early Pleistocene. Though undoubtedly affected by the influence of Pleistocene climate fluctuations, the yellow-bellied marmot apparently experienced a deep history of relative stability compared to its higher-latitude relative.",
