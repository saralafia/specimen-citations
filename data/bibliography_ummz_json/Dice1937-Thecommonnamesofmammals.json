There is good evidence that, if no popular name be already available, a suitable book name will in time come into use as a common name.",

No matter how vigorously naturalists may protest, the popular name of the American species of Bison will probably continue to be buffalo, although this animal is not at all similar to the buffalo of the Old World. The moose will continue to be the' moose, and properly so, even though it is the North American representative of the elk of Europe. Also the large deer (Cervus canadensis) of North America, which is closely related to the stag or red deer of Europe, will likely continue to be popularly known as the American elk. Nevertheless, some erroneous names can perhaps be corrected or better names applied if we naturalists can agree on suitable English appellations.",

It may be difficult to, find distinctive and short names for each species of the larger genera, however. Furthermore, some related species are s~ much alike externally that even experienced mammalogists have difficulty in distinguishing them in the field. For such groups it may be desirable to use a group name f()r 'a number of species or even for several genera. For example, it seems most suitable at present to apply the common name pocket-mouse to all the species of the genus Perognathus. Each species of pocket-mouse must then receive a descriptive adjective, as rock pocket-mouse for Perognathus intermedius.",

This name is clumsy, but it becomes much worse when another word is added to designate a particular subspecies. Thus, Dipodomys spectabilis perblandus might be called the pale bannertailed k8.ngaroo-rat. It could also be called simply the pale kangaroo-rat, but that would fail to show its relationship to the other races of its species and would greatly multiply the number of kinds of kangaroo-rats. Why not call the species the banner-tail, or give it some other similar short name?

For examples, Microtus pennsylvanicus may be known as the meadow-vole, Microtus chrotorrhinus as the rock-vole, and Phenacomys intermedius as the heather-vole.

The name encinal-mouse has reference to the occurrence of the species pectoralis in the oak forests or encinal of Texas. Major E. A. Goldman informs me that it also occurs in encinal in Mexico, although it ranges widely in habitat. Juniper-mouse is applied to nasutus on account of its common occurrence in forests of juniper and pinyon pine.
