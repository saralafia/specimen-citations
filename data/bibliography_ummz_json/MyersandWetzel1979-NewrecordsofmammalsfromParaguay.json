Monthly measurements were performed ipsilaterally in some animals, with restoration being so complete that the superficial scar of the previous month was difficult to locate. The inner tissues also seemed to reor-ganiZe quickly. Measurement of a testis at 2-week intervals probably would be feasible. Based on hundreds of surgeries perfonned to date, animals apparently survive without complications. On the basis of length, width, and mass of testes obtained in independent dissections, we find that (length) x (width)2 shows a high correlation with mass of testes (Table 1) , and thus we use these equations for estimating mass of both testes. The equations of Table 1 could also be used to estimate mass of testes in related species for which specific comparisons between linear measurements and mass are not available.",

Olfers' description, which is based on Azara's (1801) account (see Hershkovitz, 1959) , describes an animal marked with bright cinnamon (\"cannelle vif\"). Wetzel and Lovett's specimens and those reported here have predominantly Grayish Olive hairs (though blackish terminal bands impart a slightly darker appearance) and lack of cinnamon or rufous. Specimens from eastern Paraguay (Amambay) are appreciably darker, especially ventrally, than those from the Chaco, although the two groups are similar cranially. Females were collected in April (1), July (6), and September (1), but none had young. Three of the six captured in July were juveniles.

According to C. O. Handley, Jr. (pers. comm.), they are similar to Brazilian representatives of this. species from Mato Grosso and Minas Gerais, but smaller than those from Bolivia and Peru. The dorsal color is approximately Clove Brown; ventrally slightly paler. White tips on many of the hairs result in a frosted appearance; this effect is strongest ventrally, but noticeable dorsally. Weakly defined eyestripes are present. A. jamaicensis is easily distinguished from the other Artibeus known from Paraguay, A. lituratus and Artibeus sp. (probably A. fimbriatus Gray according to Handley, pers. comm.) by its much smaller size (A. lituratus, forearm, 71.0, 66.9-73.6, n = 13; Artibeus sp., forearm, 65.7,62.2-68.0, n = 15). No A. lituratus (n = 34) or Artibeus sp. (n = 11) has more than two upper molars on each side whereas all A. jamaicensis examined have three. Artibeus jamaicensis further differs from A. lituratus in having a poorly-developed orbitonasal shield, and from Artibeus sp. in much paler color. A pregnant female was captured in November, and lactating females in November and March. No pregnant or lactating females were taken in June, July, August, or March. Juveniles were found in March, July, and August. This species is commonly netted in eastern Paraguay, but is apparently rare in the west where a single individual was captured.",

Myotis simus is intermediate in size (M. simus, forearm, 38.5, 38.2--38 .9, n = 5; M. ruber, forearm, 39.5, 39.2-40.0, n = 3; M. riparius, forearm, 34.2, n = 1) and is characterized by a relatively broad postorbital constriction (M. simus, 4.0, 3.9-4.0, n = 5; M. ruber, 3.7, 3.6-3.8, n = 3; M. riparius, 3.6, n = 1).

Akodon azarae bibianae Massoia.--Presidente Hayes: Chaco-i (1 CONN). 15.5 km by road NNW Chaco-i (1 UMMZ). This species is easily distinguished from Akodon varius toba, which also occurs in the eastern Chaco, by smaller size (greatest length of skull, 25.4, 24.8-26.0, n = 2, as compared to 28.7, 26.7--31.2, n = 33 for the latter) and lack of supraorbital ridges. These specimens, both adult, were taken in heavily-grazed pastures. Akodon niKrita (Lichtenstein).-ltaplia: Puerto Pirapo (11 CONN); 3.5 km E San Rafael (4 UMMZ); 8 km N San Rafael (3 UMMZ). This species was reported for Paraguay by Bertoni (1939) as Akodon subterraneus. Massoia (1963) concluded thatthe two members of the subgenus Thaptomys, A. nigrita and A. subterraneus, are not specifically distinct and should be consid- ered subspecies of A. nigrita. Our specimens are similar to those reported as A. subterraneus from northern Argentina by Massoia (1962). All are adult or subadult; the females were neither lactating nor pregnant (July). Most were trapped in wet tropical forest in runways through grass or next to fallen logs. A. nigrita is easily distinguished from the sympatrk A. cursor montensis by its smaller size: greatest length of skull, 23.3 (21.8-24.5), n = 11 as compared to 29.3 (27.9- 31.9, n = 16 for A. c. montensis; tail, 47.2 (41-56), n = 17 in contrast to 90.1 (75-112), n = 16; and ear, 12.0 (11-13), n = 11 versus 19.3 (18-21), n = 16.

Previous records for this species, summarized by Cabrera (1958:214), are from eastern Bolivia and central to northern Argentina. Chaetophractus differs from Euphradus sexcinctus (Linnaeus) in smaller size, darker carapace and hair, and broader cephalic shield, which has a width to length ratio of 0.9 to 0.95 as opposed to 0.7. Chaetophractus vellerasus is distinguished from C. villosus by smaller size, but longer ears, which extend posteriorly past the second row of scapular scutes; tan (versus dark) hairs;",

An estimate of the northern limit was made by Seton (1909), and accumulated records have since clarified the situation somewhat. Single female L. noctivagans were found on two buildings in Chicago during January 1977. One was found dead in an interior stairwell at Chicago State Vniversity. Its location was such that it could not have been there more than a few days without being found. The other was taken",

Accepted 8 January 1979. 1\u2022 Mamm., 60(3):636-638, 1979 NEW RECORDS OF MAMMALS FROM PARAGUAY Recent field work in Paraguay has revealed several species previously unknown from that country. Specimens of 11 of these are the basis of this report. They and the recent discovery of a third species of peccary in western Paraguay (Catagonus u:agneri, Wetzel et ai., 1975) illustrate how poorly the Paraguayan fauna is known. The specimens reported here are deposited in the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology (MVZ), University of California, Berkeley; the Museum of Zoology (UMMZ), University of Michigan, Ann Arbor; and the Museum of Natural History (CONN), University of Connecticut, Storrs.",
