Thanks to revisionary research in the last several decades (reviewed by Musser and Carleton, 1993, 2005) , each of these genera is now recognized in a much more restricted sense than formerly, but many nomenclatural problems remain.

The artificiality of this usage was subsequently emphasized by karyotypic and morphological researchers (e.g., Gardner and Patton, 1976; Carleton and Musser, 1989) who raised all of the subgenera recognized by midcentury authors to generic rank. The species that are still referred to Oryzomys, however, do not comprise a monophyletic group ( fig. 1) , and it is intolerable that this situation should persist.",

In fact, Aegialomys and Cerradomys do not appear to differ consistently in any integumental or cranial feature that we have been able to identify.

In both species, the distal bacular cartilage is unambiguously trifid, with a slender but distinct central digit. By contrast, the glans penis of Cerradomys scotti, C. subflavus, and an undescribed congener from northeastern Brazil have a bifid distal bacular cartilage because the middle digit is vestigial or absent. REMARKS: Although ''Oryzomys'' galapagoensis and ''O.'' xanthaeolus have long been recognized as closely related species (e.g., by Thomas, 1894; Gardner and Patton, 1976; Patton and Hafner, 1983) , no published phylogenetic analysis of biochemical or morphological data is currently available to support the monophyly of Aegialomys as constituted herein. The presence of at least one undescribed species among the material we examined, together with questions that have been raised elsewhere concerning the taxonomic status of ica (by Musser and Carleton, 2005: 1156) and our own reservations about baroni, suggest that a revision of this group is needed to identify the terminal taxa that should be represented in future phylogenetic analyses.",

The highly distinctive anatomy of the glans penis, which lacks a central bacular digit, likewise supports this conclusion. Hopefully, the flurry of recently published descriptions of new species of Cerradomys (e.g., by Langguth and Bonvicino, 2002; Bonvicino, 2003; Brooks et al., 2004) will soon be followed by more synthetic and comprehensive studies to convincingly document species identifications and geographic distributions across the entire range of this obviously diverse clade. At least some of the many unstudied specimens representing this genus from Bolivia and Paraguay are likely to belong to taxa recently described from Brazilian material, but others may represent new forms. Unfortunately, no taxonomic study published to date has effectively transcended national boundaries.",

Within clade B, however, the relationships of Euryoryzomys were not consistently indicated by different analytic permutations. Whereas some analyses suggested that this genus may be the sister group of Mindomys + Oecomys, others recovered it as a basal lineage or as the sister group of Transandinomys, but none of these alternatives was strongly supported. Phenetically, Euryoryzomys resembles other lowland moist-forest taxa that also have large pinnae, short outer digits on the hind foot, and that normally lack accessory roots on M1/m1. Comparisons of Euryoryzomys with Hylaeamys and Transandinomys are of special interest because the species that we assign to these genera have traditionally been treated as members of the so-called ''capito'' complex of Oryzomys sensu lato (Musser et al., 1998) .",

Although only three of the species that we refer to Euryoryzomys were analyzed by Weksler (2003 Weksler ( , 2006 , more taxonomically inclusive phylogenetic studies based on morphological data also support generic monophyly (Weksler, 1996) . This clade is likewise recovered by parsimony analyses of cytochrome b sequence data that exclude third-position transitions and by neighbor-joining and maximum-likelihood analyses when transversions are weighted more heavily than transitions (Bonvicino and Moreira, 2001 Allen, 1901; tatei Musser et al., 1998; and yunganus Thomas, 1902.

Hammond, L. S\u00f6 derstr\u00f6 m, and R.S. Voss-from 1913 Voss-from to 1980 ; seven of these specimens are at the BMNH and the eighth is at the UMMZ. The single Amazonian record is based on MCZ 52543, an adult female whose skin label states that it was collected by the Olallas (a family of professional collectors) on 27 July 1929 at ''Concepci\u00f3 n, Oriente, Ecuador''. According to Paynter (1993) , Concepci\u00f3 n is at 0u489S, 77u259W, about 50 km NE of Tena between 300 and 500 m above sea level in Napo province. Several aspects of these distributional data are problematic. First, we are not aware of any other species of small nonvolant native mammal that occurs below about 1500 m on both sides of the Ecuadorean Andes. Second, the lowlands and foothills around Tena have been intensively worked over for many years by numerous collectors, none of whom have taken additional material of this species. Thus, there is some reason to question whether Mindomys really occurs in Amazonia. Additionally, it is not known if Mindo represents the upper or the lower limit of the elevational distribution of this taxon in western Ecuador, or if Mindo is somewhere in the middle of its elevational range. If Mindomys is predominantly a lowland taxon, then it might more appropriately be classified as a trans-Andean rather than as an Andean clade (sensu Weksler, 2006) . Only future fieldwork can resolve such uncertainties, which are obviously relevant to reconstructing oryzomyine historical biogeography.",

COMPARISONS: ''Oryzomys'' angouya was consistently recovered as an isolated lineage within clade D by Weksler (2003 Weksler ( , 2006 , but some analyses of mtDNA sequences weakly support a sister-group relationship with Cerradomys (see Bonvicino and Moreira, 2001; Bonvicino, 2003) . The hypothesis that Sooretamys and Cerradomys might be sister taxa was not explicitly stated by Musser et al. (1998) , but it is implicit in their concept of the ''subflavus group'' of Oryzomys sensu lato. Despite such indications, we are not aware of any compelling morphological evidence that Sooretamys and Cerradomys are more closely related to one another than they are to other members of clade D; indeed, they are strikingly divergent in many respects.",

Within clade B, Transandinomys was variously recovered by different analytic permutations as the sister taxon of Euryoryzomys, of Nephelomys, or of Handleyomys intectus + Nephelomys. Comparisons of Transandinomys with Euryoryzomys, Hylaeamys, and Nephelomys have already been provided in the accounts for those genera, salient aspects of which are summarized in table 3. The morphology of Handleyomys intectus (redescribed by Voss et al., 2002) is sufficiently distinctive that direct comparisons seem unnecessary in this context. REMARKS: Although Transandinomys bolivaris and T. talamancae are phenetically similar (as remarked by Musser et al., 1998: 323) , no analytic results are currently available to support the monophyly of this genus. The only unambiguously derived trait that appears to be uniquely shared by these species is their possession of unusually long supraorbital vibrissae, a character that was not scored for phylogenetic analysis by Weksler (2006) .",

However, the oldest available name for this clade is Holochilus (see table 1), so Oryzomys would effectively disappear from binomial usage, as would Neacomys, Nectomys, Oecomys, and many other well-established names.",

For example, one might combine the ''albigularis group'' (our Nephelomys) with ''Oryzomys'' bolivaris and ''O.'' talamancae (together comprising our Transandinomys) to form one new genus instead of two new genera. However, doing so would effectively formalize a weakly supported hypothesis and obscure the useful fact that each of these groups is a morphologically diagnosable and ecogeographically distinct collection of species. Because weakly supported groups are more likely to be rejected by future taxonomic studies than well-supported groups, and because biologists need names for clades with distinct morphologies and distributions, two new names rather than one better serve the larger community of zoological researchers in this case and in others like it discussed by Weksler (2006: 75-77) .",

In both of those cases, the result was a richer lexicon of generic names that enabled muroid researchers in Asia and North America to communicate more effectively about a wide range of biological topics than they had previously been able to do. We expect that a similar benefit will now accrue to muroid researchers in the Neotropics.",
