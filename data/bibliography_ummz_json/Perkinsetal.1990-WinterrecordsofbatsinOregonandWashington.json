Most bats were easily identified from observable external characters (Hall 1981) We located 174 bats of seven species at 26 sites (Table 1) . M. volans (124) and M.

BARSS, AND JOSHUA PETERSON Winter records of bats in the Pacific Northwest are extremely limited (Barbour and Davis 1969). Of the 15 bat species other than Plecotus townsendii in Oregon and Washington, at least two are considered migratory. Five species (Eptesicus fuscus, Myotis californicus, M. Iucifugus, M. volans, Antrozous pallidus) are known to hibernate in the eastern portion of their ranges (Barbour and Davis 1969; Twente 1960). Marcot (1984) reported records for hibernating Myotis evotis in northern California, Senger et al. (1974) noted five species of hibernating myotids (M. californicus, M. evotis, M. Iucifugus, M. volans and M. yumanensis) in Washington, Genter (1986) observed hibernating M. Ie.;bii in Idaho, and Jewett (1955) recorded Tadarida brasiliensis from buildings in southwestern Oregon.Most hibernacula contained relatively few bats (range = 1-41) when compared with those of the eastern United States(Barbour and Davis 1969). The reports were from studies concentrated in small geographical areas and involved a small number of caves.Twente (1960), who investigated over 600 potential hibernacula in Utah, speculated few hibernating bats were noted because of warm temperatures in the caves."
