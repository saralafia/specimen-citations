The white-footed mouse, Peromyscus leucopus, has expanded its range northward in Michigan and Wisconsin since 1980 and is now common in localities where it was previously unknown. To investigate the origin and history of the newly established populations, complete D-loop sequences were analyzed from 595 white-footed mice collected throughout the northern Great Lakes region. Mice from Wisconsin and the western Upper Peninsula (UP) of Michigan make up a well-differentiated lineage, while the eastern UP and the Lower Peninsula (LP) of Michigan form a second lineage. The two lineages diverged about 34,000 BP, well before they migrated to the Great Lakes region. The close genetic relationship between mice in the LP and those in the eastern UP is probably due primarily to accidental transport by humans and may have implications for the spread of Lyme disease in the Upper Midwest.",

Some species can track suitable environmental conditions by moving to higher elevations (Moritz et al. 2008; Yang et al. 2011) or latitudes (Parmesan et al. 1999) , while the movement of other species may be constrained by geographic barriers (e.g., Coulon et al. 2006) . To understand how species will shift their ranges in the future, we should consider how they respond to such constraints, which may be illuminated not only by the course of recent migrations but also by looking back to the establishment of those species within their historical ranges.",

Also, the region is relatively young, having been ice-free for only about 10,000 to 12,000 years (Pielou 1991; Holman 2001) , which is recent enough that some species still show genetic signatures of their postglacial migrations (Rowe et al. 2004 (Rowe et al. , 2006 Taylor and Hoffman 2010) . The region also encompasses a historical dividing line between two substantially different mammalian faunal assemblages (Baker 1983; Kurta 2017 ) associated with two different forest types, eastern deciduous forest across the southern part of the lakes and mixed deciduous-boreal forest to the north.",

Although the niches of P. leucopus and P. maniculatus overlap extensively, there are differences between the species that may prove to be important (Wolff 1996) . Of particular concern is that P. leucopus is a major natural reservoir for Borrelia burgdorferi, the bacterium that causes Lyme disease (Ostfeld et al. 2006; Cook and Barbour 2015) , while P. m. gracilis is considered to be a less-competent host (Fiset et al. 2015) . Peromyscus leucopus is also a common host for the major vector of Lyme disease in North America, the black-legged tick, Ixodes scapularis (CDC 2017). The range expansion of P. leucopus is thus likely to increase the prevalence of Lyme disease in the region, especially if new populations are founded by mice from areas with high current rates of B. burgdorferi infection (Fiset et al. 2015) .",

The genetics of the recently established populations of P. leucopus in the UP of Michigan have been examined using microsatellites (Baumgartner and Hoffman 2019) , which revealed little genetic structure and high rates of gene flow, but these results do not shed light on the situation before 1980. A larger-scale study using mitochondrial DNA (Rowe et al. 2006) found two lineages of P. leucopus reaching into the Upper Midwest, a western lineage extending from southern Illinois to northern Minnesota and an eastern lineage extending from western Tennessee northward to the Lower Peninsula (LP) of Michigan and eastward to Nova Scotia; that study, however, included very few samples from the northern Great Lakes region, with no samples from Michigan's UP. In this study, we use mtDNA from populations across northern Wisconsin and Michigan to investigate the history of P. leucopus in this area, focusing on the origins of the newly established populations as well as their putative progenitor populations.",

Polymerase chain reactions (PCR) were carried out in a volume of 25 \u03bcl, containing 1.75 mM of MgCl, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 1 \u03bcM of each primer, 1 U of Platinum Taq (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California), and 50-100 ng of DNA template, on an Eppendorf Mastercycle thermocycler (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). After 2 min of denaturation at 95\u00b0C, 35 cycles were run under the following conditions: denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 45 s, annealing at 56\u00b0C for 60 s, and expansion at 72\u00b0C for 75 s. DNA products were checked on a 1.5% agarose gel (Invitrogen) and cleaned using QIAquick Gel Extraction Kits (Qiagen) in preparation for direct automated sequencing. DNA was sequenced at the University of Michigan DNA Sequencing Core, in an Applied Biosystems DNA Sequencer, Model 3730 XL (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California). The same primers used in the PCR reactions were also used for sequencing; however, reverse sequencing was usually incomplete because the reaction terminated at approximately 200 base pairs (bp). This phenomenon was also reported by Rowe et al. (2006) while sequencing the control region of P. leucopus and P. maniculatus. According to these authors, sequencing from the Phe tRNA stopped after 180 bp due to a palindromic sequence (GGGGGGAAGGGGGG) that interferes with the reaction. A subset of samples (n = 14) was sequenced twice for quality control purposes and the exact same sequence was obtained in each case. The lengths of the sequences varied between 1,000 and 1,050 bp, depending on the chromatogram quality. A representative sequence of each haplotype is deposited in GenBank (accession numbers GU810187-GU810356).",

Eighteen preliminary simulations were run assuming the HKY mutation model (Hasegawa et al. 1985) . Once priors that produced bell-shaped curves were found for each parameter, 1 \u00d7 10 6 cycles for the burn-in time and 10 \u00d7 10 6 cycles for the Markov chain were run. To assess consistency of the parameters estimated across runs, and insure that the chains were well mixed, each simulation was repeated three times, using an identical setting each time but a different random seed. If the simulations yielded similar results, the one with the highest effective sample size, which is a measurement of the independent points sampled for each parameter, was chosen for estimation of demographic parameters (see below).",

The mutation rate was calculated based on the genetic divergence observed between P. leucopus and P. maniculatus in mtDNA D-loop sequences, assuming a divergence time inferred from the fossil record of 500,000 BP (Hibbard 1968) . Haplotypes for 43 P. leucopus and 37 P. maniculatus were compared; of the 913 aligned sites (after excluding gaps and missing data), there were 82 substitutions (~13%), which yields a mutation rate, \u03bc, of 1.588*10 \u22127 mutations/year/site for both species. This estimate is roughly the same as the ones obtained by Rowe et al. (2006) and Taylor and Hoffman (2010) using shorter sequences from the same mitochondrial region. However, any estimation based on this rate should be interpreted with caution because of the uncertainty in determining the actual date when P. leucopus and P. maniculatus diverged. Also, a precise estimate of generation length for this species is not attainable because generations overlap and reproductive rates vary, depending on when during the year females are born, which is in turn influenced by geography. In this study, we assumed two generations/year (Millar 1989; Rowe et al. 2006; Centeno-Cuadros et al. 2009; Taylor and Hoffman 2010) .",

These mice sort into two well-differentiated, reciprocally monophyletic groups, one comprising populations from Wisconsin and the westerncentral UP (WUP-WI), and the other populations from the LP and eastern UP (LP-EUP). The two groups display an evident genetic signature of postglacial spatial expansion, as shown by the shallow topology of the haplotype tree, which has a small number of widespread haplotypes and a large number of haplotypes with only 1-3 copies. Also, the gene diversity indices (Supplementary Data SD1) reveal high haplotype diversity and low nucleotide diversity, due to the presence of many derived haplotypes that are differentiated by only a few mutations (Hewitt 2000; Taylor and Keller 2007) . The time estimate for the split between WI and LP mice, 34,470 BP (Table 1) , suggests that these populations began to diverge thousands of years prior to the formation of Lake Michigan (about 13,000 BP- Holman 2001) . At that time, the mice may have occupied a common refugium or multiple different refugia outside of the glaciated region (Rowe et al. 2006 ); subsequently, as they expanded into newly habitable lands, populations may have become isolated during cooling cycles. Later, the formation of Lake Michigan would have reinforced this isolation.",

Thus, newly founded mouse populations in the UP have two distinct origins, one in Wisconsin and the other in the LP, and represent a new contact zone between two well-established lineages. Genetic differences between mice from the WUP-WI and LP-EUP regions explain more than 65% of the total genetic variation observed in our sample, and the partition supported by this analysis is consistent with the WUP-WI and LP-EUP clades found in the gene genealogy. This partition is also consistent with the Mantel test results, which show a correlation between genetic and geographic distances that is positive and statistically significant for both of the groups identified by SAMOVA (WUP-WI: r = 0.33, P < 0.01; LP-EUP: r = 0.58, P < 0.01). A strong pattern of isolation-by-distance was to be expected given that we used a maternally inherited genetic marker (mtDNA); dispersal in P. leucopus is known to be male-biased (Jacquot and Vessey 1995) , and thus nuclear markers would provide a better estimate of the relationship between genetic and geographic distances for these populations. , with colder colors (i.e., blue-green) indicating high-genetic similarity, and warmer colors (i.e., orange-red) low-genetic similarity.

This might be explained by ancestral polymorphism, natural dispersal (across ice or by rafting), or human-mediated dispersal. Given that WI and LP mice have no haplotypes in common and are reciprocally monophyletic, ancestral polymorphism seems unlikely. Natural dispersal, although possible, would require that the mice have repeatedly crossed substantial water barriers. Accidental transport by humans seems the best explanation for the movement of mice between the LP and the eastern end of the UP, a movement facilitated by the Mackinac Bridge, which has connected these two landmasses for the past 62 years. Human transport is also the most likely explanation for a few mice that cluster with geographically distant populations, such as a genetically LP-EUP mouse that was collected in central Wisconsin and several mice from the Illinois clade collected in Chippewa Co. in the easternmost UP (Supplementary Data SD2).",

Similar to P. leucopus, the P. m. gracilis mtDNA haplotypes form a shallow tree with eastern and western mitochondrial clades, and the easternmost UP mice cluster with the LP mice. However, the eastern UP P. m. gracilis are from long-established populations (Myers et al. 2009 ) that apparently colonized the area sometime in the last 11,000 years via natural dispersal (Taylor and Hoffman 2010) . Human transport of P. m. gracilis between the LP and the eastern UP is likely ongoing, but any recently transported LP mice cannot be distinguished from the postglacial colonists by using mtDNA, since those two groups already share haplotypes. Microsatellite markers do distinguish UP from LP P. m. gracilis populations, but there is little genetic structure within each peninsula, suggesting that substantial gene flow between eastern and western UP mice during the last 11,000 years has homogenized their nuclear markers (Taylor and Hoffman 2012) .",

Peromyscus leucopus microsatellite markers show high genetic diversity within and low differentiation among populations from the LP and the eastern and central UP, with no apparent founder effects in newly established populations and no sorting by mtDNA lineages (Taylor and Hoffman 2014; Baumgartner and Hoffman 2019) . This is consistent with a scenario of rapid expansion of P. leucopus into the UP from two sources, human-transferred mice in the east and natural migrants plus some transferred mice in the west, followed by substantial numbers of migrants moving among the new populations. Additional analyses of independent nuclear loci in the future could provide a more detailed picture of the recent expansion of each lineage and of their hybridization in the UP.",

The ecological consequences of this are unknown but may be significant, as mice from the genus Peromyscus numerically dominate most small mammal communities in this region. A graver concern, however, is the surprising extent to which P. leucopus is apparently being moved about the region by humans.
