Given that species ranges are closely allied to physiological thermal tolerances in marine organisms [2] , it may therefore be expected that ocean warming would lead to abundance increases at poleward side of ranges, and abundance declines towards the equator [3] . Here we report a global analysis of abundance trends of 304 widely distributed marine species over the last century, across a range of taxonomic groups from phytoplankton to fish and marine mammals. Specifically, using a literature database we investigate the extent that the direction and strength of long-term species abundance changes depend on the sampled location within the latitudinal range of species. Our results show that abundance increases have been most prominent where sampling has taken place at the poleward side of species ranges, while abundance declines have been most prominent where sampling has taken place at the equatorward side of species ranges. These data provide evidence of omnipresent large-scale changes in abundance of marine species consistent with warming over the last century, and suggest that adaptation has not provided a buffer against the negative effects of warmer conditions at the equatorward extent of species ranges. On the basis of these results we suggest that projected sea temperature increases of up to 1.5\u00b0C over pre-industrial levels by 2050 [4] will continue to drive latitudinal abundance shifts in marine species, including those of importance for coastal livelihoods.",

As such, species distributions often correspond closely with physiological temperature limits [2, 5] . Cold tolerance can determine the position of the poleward edge of a species range, and consequently, ocean warming is expected to increase organismal performance, survival and reproductive success at higher latitudes of species ranges. It has therefore been predicted that warming seas should also drive increases in the abundance of species at their poleward range side [6] . Equally, warm tolerance is strongly associated with the position of the equatorward edge of marine species ranges. Hence, as oceans warm we may expect to find reductions in performance, survival and recruitment at lower latitudes of species ranges, leading to reductions in abundance at equatorward range limits [4] .",

Species distributions and abundances are also dependent upon availability of core ecological resources such as food and substrate, which are not homogenously distributed across species ranges. Consequently, distributions of species may not be fully predicted on the basis of the thermal environment and physiological tolerances alone [7] . Moreover, the temporal population-abundance response of species to warming at any position in their range may not exclusively depend on their thermal physiology, but also the responses of the species with which they interact [8] . An additional consideration is that regional temperature shifts are not the only physical changes in the marine environment associated with climate change, as parallel changes to storminess [9, 10] , salinity [11] , acidification [12] and sea ice conditions [13] have also been reported. To fully understand abundance changes of populations requires a comprehensive understanding of marine environmental change, as well as the physiological, life history and ecological characteristics of study species [14] .",

In general, studies have reported that within local communities warm-adapted species have increased in abundance, relative to cool-adapted species that have declined in abundance [2, 6, 15, 16] . However, such studies tend to be limited to a small number of species and a single locality or region. A more complete understanding of large-scale patterns of climate-associated local abundance change requires combining information from multiple studies across broad taxonomic diversity, and across wider spatial scales that encompass the full realised latitudinal distributions of study species [17] . In the most comprehensive analyses of marine species to date, abundance responses have been interpreted as being at poleward and equatorward limits [2] or \"consistent\" or \"inconsistent\" with climate change [17] based on the findings of the original authors. However, a fully quantitative approach is required to test the strength of evidence for species-level poleward abundance increases and equatorward abundance declines within marine systems over the last century. Here, we consider abundance trends of marine species over the last century within an explicit latitudinal and quantitative framework.",

By contrast species were significantly more likely to have declined in abundance if a study had been undertaken at the equatorward side than the poleward range side (Figure 2A ). We found no influence of survey methods or hemisphere of the study (Table S1 ). We repeated analyses on a subset of the dataset where the original authors report a statistically significant change in abundance over the study period (185 from 540 records), and again we found the position in the latitudinal range of the species to be the most important predictor of the direction of abundance change ( Figure 2B ). Next, we explored the strength of abundance responses to temperature (or year) using the reported correlation coefficients (r values) that were available for 77 from 540 records.

However, there is a possibility that observations of significant abundance change matching expectations from climate change are more likely to be selected for publication [19] . This effect is plausibly strongest in singlespecies studies [17] , which comprised 68 records in our analysis, so we repeated analyses on only the 472 records from multispecies studies. Our analyses were robust with respect to potential publication bias, with position of the study within the latitudinal range again the strongest predictor of the direction of abundance responses in the multispecies analysis (Table    S1 ). The reported observations in our dataset are spatially clustered, with the majority of observations (448 of the 540 records) from the Northern Hemisphere, and were concentrated in the temperate continental shelf waters of Europe, North America and Japan ( Figure 1A ). To investigate potential influence of spatial bias we subsampled the data to exclude records that were in close spatial proximity to other records from the same species (within the same 1 Addressing taxonomic bias, we explored if survey position in the species range was a consistent predictor of species responses among each of the five taxonomic or functional groups that were most well represented in the dataset, namely non-larval fishes, larval bony fishes, seabirds, benthic invertebrates, and zooplankton ( Figure 1B) . Although we found that the extent of the response varied significantly among these groups (Table S2) , we found a consistent pattern of observed abundance increases at the poleward side of species range, and decline at equatorward sides in all taxonomic groups. This pattern was statistically significant in individual analyses of non-larval fishes, larval bony fishes and seabirds (P < 0.05, Table S2 ), with larval bony fishes having a more pronounced positive response at the poleward side of their range relative to other groups (Table S2, Figure 3 ). This result highlights variation among marine organisms (and potentially their varied life stages) in their responses to warming. Differences among taxonomic or functional groups may be expected due to variation in life history traits including reproductive rates, dispersal biology, migratory behaviour and growth rates [14] , which in turn affect opportunities to maximise on ecological opportunity.",

Such situations can arise when the other physiological (e.g. oxygen availability) or ecological (e.g. food availability) constraints dominate, although such constraints often covary with temperature (e.g. [20] ). Equally, there are situations where the latitudinal limit of a species is determined by a geographic barrier such as the presence of a continental landmass, or the absence of suitable substrate to colonise [21] , rather than the thermal environment. Finally, the abundance of many species will also have been influenced by human activities in recent history, such as habitat degradation and fisheries, which may have already influenced population sizes and limited capacity for rapid response to climate warming [22] .",

This is consistent with expectations that marine species have shifted abundance in line with their full thermal tolerance limits [2] , and is important because it is suggestive of thermal tolerance limits of species being relatively inflexible over decadal timescales. Specifically, it also indicates that populations of marine organisms at the equatorial sides of species ranges are unable to adapt at a sufficiently rapid pace to enable them to thrive in warmer conditions. Evolutionary adaptation to warming conditions may be particularly slow for species with relatively long generation times such as the marine fishes [26] which dominate our dataset, but by contrast evolutionary adaptation may be expected to be more rapid in taxonomic or functional groups with fast life histories such as phytoplankton [27] . It is also plausible that differential responses of marine species to warming will result in abundance shift mismatches between interdependent components of marine communities, for example predators and their prey [28] .",

Additionally, the available data was strongly biased towards temperate latitudes and further work is needed to determine whether the same patterns hold for tropical species. With increased recognition of the value of long-term and resurvey data, increasing numbers of datasets are becoming available through initiatives to study broader patterns of biodiversity change [29, 30] . There are also efforts to bring together and standardise existing datasets over space and time, to enable abundance change estimates to be made across vast expanses of marine habitat [31] . Thus, it is possible that future analyses will be able to evaluate temporal abundance changes across much larger proportions of species ranges than are considered here, enabling a more thorough evaluation of how physiological, ecological, and life history traits interact with environmental variation to drive abundance changes within individual species.",

Thus, our study builds on evidence of climate-associated local abundance changes and sits alongside climatedriven changes in other biological parameters such as the overall distributions of species, and shifts in the timing of life history events [2] . Average sea surface temperatures are set to rise further over the course of this century [4] and the frequency of marine heatwaves is increasing [32] . It therefore seems plausible that local abundance changes linked to physiological and ecological tolerances will continue to take place at both the poleward and equatorward sides of species ranges impacting further on local marine assemblages and the coastal industries that depend on them.

We then checked original papers to ensure observations were from fully marine species or species dependent on the ocean, and then also checked and assigned direction of the abundance response over the studied time interval. Secondly, we compiled observations from literature published between 2012 and 2016 using the same methodology as Poloczanska et al. [17] . For both sets of records we retained only those where abundance trends could clearly be attributed to individual species. Each study was defined as a continuous time series, an irregularly sampled study or a two-point comparison, as determined from the original paper. Studies were categorised as single-species (reporting trends for one species only) or multispecies (abundance trends for multiple species reported).",
