                "text": "Agricultural production is expanding at rapid rates in the tropics. As a consequence, most tropical forests exist as fragments embedded within a mosaic of agricultural land (Perfecto and Vandermeer 2008) . Organisms that inhabit these landscapes must be able to persist within agricultural lands or navigate through them to reach habitable patches (Levins 1969) . Therefore, the development of successful conservation strategies requires an understanding of the effect of agricultural production and intensification on population persistence. Agricultural intensification is the transition from traditional production systems (e.g., crop rotation, polycultures) to systems with industrial management practices (e.g., monocultures, use of agrochemicals) (Perfecto et al. 2009) . For example, coffee production in Latin America falls along an intensification gradient ranging from rustic polyculture to unshaded monocultures (Moguel and Toledo 1999; Fig. 1a ). This has made coffee production a model system for studies of the effects of agricultural intensification on biodiversity. Studies in coffee agroecosystems have shown a decrease in biodiversity as agricultural management intensity increases for many species, such as ants, birds, trees, bees, and bats (Perfecto and Vandermeer 2015) . Less is known about the effects that management practices have on the dispersal and gene flow of species in this system. Recently, with the development of new molecular techniques, indirect measures of dispersal can be used for studies of population connectivity (Manel et al. 2003) . Gene flow can decrease with fragmentation, generating population structure within a species and increasing the impact of genetic drift (Frankel and Soul\u00e9 1981) . With genetic measurements, we can evaluate the negative effects of land use change and fragmentation (e.g., loss of genetic diversity, increased differentiation) (Manel et al. 2003 ).",

Because H. d. goldmani is a forest specialist, we expect the species to be present in the forest fragment and within coffee farms that are either close to forest edges or within a coffee matrix of high quality (e.g., low management intensity).

Coffee farms were named after the level of management intensity (i.e., low, medium, and high) based on the Moguel and Toledo (1999) classification system. Our sampling covered an area of approximately 1.6 km 2 (see Supplementary Material). Sex and GPS coordinates for each individual sample were recorded (Table S1 , Supplementary Material), and DNA extracted from ear tissue samples. Microsatellite primers were designed specifically for H. d. goldmani by the Savannah River Ecology Laboratory. All samples were genotyped for 11 microsatellite loci (Table S2 , Supplementary Information). We estimated relatedness (r) within and between sites to: (1) identify siblings and (2) assess bias in dispersal of males and females. We calculated three different relatedness estimators (Ritland 1996; Queller and Goodnight 1989; Lynch and Ritland (1999) We estimated the number of genetic units (K) and the locations of breaks in gene flow that delineate these clusters using Geneland 4.0.3 (Guillot et al. 2008 ), a spatial Bayesian clustering method. The analysis included 20 independent runs, using a range of K from 1 to 10. After determining the optimal number of genetic units or populations (K), a separate run was performed for the assignment of individuals (see Supplementary information for details). For the genetic clusters identified by Geneland we measured genetic diversity by quantifying observed heterozygosity (H O ), expected heterozygosity (H E ) and fixation index (F IS ) GenAlEx (Peakall and Smouse 2012) . Additionally, we calculated the allelic richness (AR) in ADZE (Szpiech et al. 2008) using, as our sample size, the number of individuals present in the smallest cluster. To assess differences in genetic diversity between clusters we used values for each measure (i.e., F IS , H E , H O , AR) for each locus at each cluster and conducted a bootstrapping analysis of the mean in R 3.2.4 (2016). To assess genetic differentiation between groups we calculated F ST (Wright 1951) using Arlequin (Excoffier and Lischer 2010) . We also measured F ST for each sex separately to check for signals of sex biased dispersal.",

Resource availability in the coffee farms may explain some of the observed genetic structure. Coffee agroecosystems with low to medium management intensity (e.g., polyculture, shade grown, limited use of pesticides) have a higher vegetation complexity (Moguel and Toledo 1999) and a forest-like understory. In contrast, high intensity coffee agroecosystems present an understory substantially different from a natural forest, raising the question of how H. d. goldmani, a forest dwelling rodent, can persist in what must be a harsh environment for it. The mountainous landscape in which these farms occur makes some areas inaccessible to production. Farms usually have several steep ravines that are rarely planted or managed. These areas could be serving as small oases providing the resources the mice need to survive, but only in these very local micro habitats.",

These studies found small genetic distances between forest populations of Heteromys gaumeri (Schmidt et al. 1989 ) using protein electrophoresis, and no genetic structure based on mitochondrial DNA for H. nelsoni, (Rios et al. 2016) . Both species have a different ecology and distribution than H. desmarestianus and may not be directly comparable. Other studies examining the population structure of small mammals in agricultural landscapes have reported a variety of genetic responses to matrix composition and fragmentation (Gauffre et al. 2008; Banks et al. 2005) , showing that species responses to the matrix depend on the organism's life history. Generalist small mammal species have been reported to show high levels of connectivity between natural and agricultural lands (Gauffre et al. 2008) , while specialist species show the opposite pattern of restricted dispersal (Banks et al. 2005) . Our results for H. d. goldmani suggest that the coffee agricultural matrix may be permeable enough to facilitate dispersal and gene flow.",

However, more research is needed in this area to understand the management practices that drive these genetic patterns. Replicating this study in other forest fragments and coffee farms in the area would help us gain a broader understanding of the effects of land use change and fragmentation on small mammal communities at a broader scale. Moving forward, it is important also to understand patterns of connectivity, and more importantly gene flow, among populations in natural continuous landscapes. Finally, our study demonstrates the impact of the agricultural matrix in dispersal of a species and the importance of understanding long-term responses of populations to these changes. ",
