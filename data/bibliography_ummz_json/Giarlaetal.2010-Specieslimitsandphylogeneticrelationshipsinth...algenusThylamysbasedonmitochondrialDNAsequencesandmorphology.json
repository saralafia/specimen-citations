Their common English name refers to the seasonal deposition of caudal fat ( fig. 1 ), a phylogenetically derived trait that Thylamys shares with its sister taxon Lestodelphys (see Morton, 1980) . Together, Thylamys, Lestodelphys, and four other didelphid genera (Chacodelphys, Cryptonanus, Gracilinanus, Marmosops) comprise the tribe Thylamyini, one of two well-supported suprageneric groups of small, mouselike or ''murine'' opossums (Voss and Jansa, 2009) .",

Both approaches have unique advantages and limitations. Analyses based on DNA sequencing, for example, have the advantage of abundant character data, but sequence data can be difficult to interpret in the absence of phenotypic criteria linking gene trees to name-bearing types and other unsequenced material. Additionally, gene sequencing is relatively expensive, and the restricted availability of preserved tissue samples has hitherto limited molecular studies to treatments of no more than a few dozen individuals. By contrast, morphological analyses have the advantage of almost cost-free data collection and abundant material, but they are often hindered by a poverty of taxonomically informative characters.",

For a number of theoretical and practical reasons, mtDNA sequence monophyly and morphological diagnosability are now routinely used as joint criteria for species recognition by vertebrate systematists (Zamudio and Greene, 1997; Frost et al., 1998; Patton et al., 2000; Wiens and Penkrot, 2002) . Because substitution rates and haplotype coalescence are, in general, much more rapid for mitochondrial than for nuclear genes (Moore, 1995; Palumbi and Cipriano, 1998) , mitochondrial sequence data are potentially more informative than nuclear DNA with regard to recent lineage formation. Morphological diagnosability, on the other hand, is important as a proxy for nuclear-gene divergence (Wiens and Penkrot, 2002) because it allows haplotype groups to be associated with appropriate clade names, and because it allows geographic ranges to be mapped without sequencing every specimen.",

This is (coincidentally) close to the threshold value for species delimitation suggested by Bradley and Baker (2001) , but some didelphids that maintain unambiguously diagnostic morphological differences in sympatry-and so would be recognized as valid species by any current definition-have much less divergent CYTB sequences (e.g., 4% between Philander mcilhennyi and P. opossum; Patton and da Silva, 1997) . Therefore, although we estimate pairwise sequence divergence for comparative purposes, we do not necessarily consider divergence values to be critical indicators of species status.",

All extractions and subsequent sequence amplifications for dried tissues were conducted in a UV-sterilized hood to avoid contamination with foreign DNA. To further minimize the risk of contamination, all procedures conducted prior to amplification were conducted in a laboratory in which amplified mammalian DNA has never been present. Most of the museum specimens from which such material was removed are decades old and have been handled extensively, so it was necessary to thoroughly wash the samples in order to remove foreign DNA and potential PCR inhibitors. First, we washed whole pieces of the dried tissue in 800 mL of 100% ethanol by vortexing the sample for one minute and letting it rest overnight. The following day, we removed the liquid, resuspended the tissue in 100% ethanol, vortexed the sample for an additional minute, and then immediately repeated the same wash. We repeated a similar set of three washes (one overnight, then two for one minute) using 70% ethanol and then, finally, using water, for a total of nine washes per sample. We extracted DNA using a Qiagen DNA Minikit (Qiagen Inc.) after the washed tissue samples were digested for 48 hours in a solution of tissue lysis buffer and as much proteinase K as was necessary to completely digest the sample, typically 30-40 mL.",

For each of the four datasets, we evaluated the relative fit of different data-partitioning strategies in a Bayesian framework.

For the combined-gene dataset, we evaluated the relative fit of four partitioning strategies: (1) a single partition for all genes in combination (combined: unpartitioned); (2) three partitions, one for each of the three genes (by gene); (3) three partitions, one for each of the codon positions across all genes (combined: by codon position); and (4) nine partitions, one for each codon position for each of the three genes (by gene by codon position). Several statistical approaches have been suggested in the literature for evaluating the relative fit of different partitioning schemes, including Bayes factors (Kass and Raftery, 1995) , the Akaike information criterion (AIC; Akaike, 1974) , and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC; Schwarz, 1978) . Although Bayes factors have been shown to be reasonably effective tools for choosing among partitioning schemes (Brown and Lemmon, 2007) , the number of parameters contained in alternative models is not explicitly incorporated into the calculation of Bayes factors. The AIC and BIC both apply penalties to the addition of parameters, mitigating the problems associated with overparameterization (McGuire et al., 2007) . Therefore, to account for potential overparameterization, we only ranked partitioning strategies using the AIC and BIC.",

First, an ML analysis was performed in GARLI following the same protocol described above, except that constraint trees were used to infer the best tree that conformed to the alternative hypothesis in question. We then implemented the SH test in PAUP* using 1000 resampling estimated log likelihoods (RELL) replicates to compare the constrained ML tree to the best ML tree from the above analysis, allowing the program to estimate all parameters.

We used the combined-gene ML topology to reconstruct the ancestral distributions of Elegans Group lineages relative to the Andes. Tips were coded as occurring east of the Andes (cis-Andean), west of the Andes (trans-Andean), or both (ambiguous). We optimized ancestral areas on the topology using the parsimony criterion for ancestral state optimization of unordered characters as implemented in MacClade 4.08 (Maddison and Maddison, 2000) .",

Therefore, we treated the unsequenced regions in question as missing data in all of the analyses. and BI analyses. Maximum parsimony analysis of each dataset resulted in well-resolved strict consensus trees (table 4). Because we recovered the same species-level clades in all analyses of each dataset, we show only the ML phylogenies in this report and superimpose nodal support values from each analysis on that tree. For MP and ML analyses, support for a node is considered strong if that node receives bootstrap values 75% or greater, moderate for values between 50% and 75%, and weak for values of 50% or less. For BI, nodes are considered strongly supported for BPP values greater than or equal to 0.95 and weakly supported for values less than 0.95.",

One sequence has GenBank accession number AF431926 and was said to have been obtained from a Paraguayan specimen of Thylamys macrurus (field number NK 27536). The second is AF431927, said to have been obtained from a Bolivian specimen of T. pusillus (NK 25139). Both sequences were originally obtained and analyzed by Palma et al. (2002) , but Braun et al. (2005) and Carvalho et al. (2009) subsequently used AF431926 (downloaded from GenBank) in their analyses. Because we independently extracted and amplified cyto-chrome b from NK 27536 (T. macrurus) and NK 25139 (T. pusillus), we were able to compare our sequences with those obtained by Palma et al. (2002) . Sequence alignment indicates that both of our T. macrurus sequences (from specimens NK 27536 and APC 932) are much more similar to each other (p-distance 5 0.7%) than either is to AF431926 (average p-distance 5 21.23%). A BLAST comparison of AF431926 against other sequences in GenBank reveals that its closest match to previously published data (87%) is a cytochrome-b sequence from Marmosops impavidus (U34670). A BLAST search on the purported T. pusillus sequence (AF431927) clearly demonstrates that it does not belong to a marsupial; instead, it is 95% identical to several GenBank sequences from the cricetid rodent Phyllotis xanthopygus (e.g., AY431053 distributed in a variety of habitats in Argentina, and (3) a subclade of T. pallidior A invaded the altiplano of Bolivia and Chile (along the crest of the Andes, and therefore of ambiguous classification with respect to our cis/trans dichotomy).",

By contrast, Lestodelphys and most species of Thylamys are ''tricolored'' (sensu Tate, 1933: 209 ) because a distinctly darker middorsal color zone is separated from a distinctly paler lateral color zone along a line of demarcation that extends on each side from a point on the forehead posteriorly to the rump.

Our observations in this respect are consistent with those of Tate (1933: 234) and Carmignotto and Monfort (2006) , who likewise noted the taxonomically unusual pelage pigmentation of this species. Although Carmignotto and Monfort (2006) suggested that the tricolor pattern is indistinct in another species, T. karimii, the specimens of T. karimii that we examined had unmistakably tricolored fur. VENTRAL PELAGE PATTERN: The ventral pelage of many small didelphids consists of hairs that are either ''self-colored''-having the same pale (whitish or yellowish) coloration from base to tip-or they are gray based. Gray-based hairs are, as the term implies, grayish basally, but they are abruptly paler (usually whitish or yellowish) distally. In some species of Thylamys (e.g., T. pusillus) the entire ventrum is covered with selfcolored hairs, but in others (e.g., T. elegans) a median streak of self-colored ventral fur is bordered by broad lateral zones of graybased fur; in three species (T. sponsorius, T. velutinus, and T. venustus) almost all of the ventral fur is gray based. have a bicolored tail that is dark (brownish or grayish) above and abruptly paler (whitish) on the ventral surface. In most species, the dark dorsal coloration extends all the way to the tip of the tail, but the tail tip is pale (whitish) above and below for several millimeters in most examined specimens of T. macrurus and T. tatei, and in some specimens of T. pusillus from northeastern Argentina. CAUDAL PREHENSILE SURFACE: In most species of Thylamys, the ventral surface of the tail is provided with a hairless prehensile surface consisting of a shallow median groove and an apical pad bearing dermatoglyphs (Carmignotto and Monfort, 2006: fig. 4c ). However, in T. karimii (op. cit.: fig. 4a ) and T. velutinus (op. cit.: fig. 4b ) the median groove is indistinct or absent and the apical pad, although hairless, lacks dermatoglyphs.",

Nasals were scored as short if these bones did not extend posteriorly as far as the lacrimals, long if they terminated at about the same level as the lacrimals, and very long if they terminated well behind the lacrimals. Intraspecific variation in this character was often noted, but some taxonomic variation in trait frequencies are noteworthy (table 7) .

In Thylamys velutinus (A, based on ZMUC 166 and 167), almost the entire plantar surface is tubercular, with vestigial dermatoglyphs (d) restricted to the apices of the plantar pads; the latter are fused together and extend inward to the center of the palm, which lacks a concave central area. The claws are long in this species, extending well beyond the fleshy finger tips. In T. macrurus (B, MZUSP 32097) dermatoglyphs are more extensive on the fingertips and on the plantar pads, the plantar pads are separate and surround a concave central palmar surface (ccps), and the claws are short, not extending much beyond the fleshy tip of each digit.",

In T. pusillus (B, AMNH 260025) the infraorbital foramen is usually above P3, the lacrimal foramina are often concealed inside the orbit, and the nasolabial fossa is shallow. In Thylamys pallidior (C, AMNH 262406) the infraorbital foramen is usually above M1, the lacrimal foramina are often partially exposed, and the nasolabial fossa is shallow. some species have supraorbital ''beads'' (upturned lateral margins flanked by shallow grooves; see Voss and Jansa, 2009: fig. 11B ). We observed supraorbital beads on all examined adult specimens of T. karimii and most examined adult specimens of T. macrurus and T. pusillus, but beading occurs infrequently in other species (table 10). Beading is clearly subject to ontogenetic variation because juveniles and subadults seldom have beads, even in species that usually have them as adults, and they tend to be better developed among old adult specimens than among conspecific young adults. In some large adult male specimens of T. karimii, T. macrurus, and T. pusillus, supraorbital beads project laterally to form small postorbital processes.",

Incisive foramina, maxillopalatine fenestrae, palatine fenestrae, and posterolateral palatal foramina ( fig. 16 ) are invariably present in Thylamys. By contrast, maxillary fenestrae-perforations in the maxillary bone lateral to the maxillopalatine openings-are normally present in some species but not in others. Maxillary fenestrae are consistently present in examined specimens of Thylamys karimii, T. macrurus, T. sponsorius, and T. velutinus, but they are usually also present in T. pusillus and T. venustus (table 11) . By contrast, maxillary fenestrae are consistently Thylamys the crowns of I2-I5 increase in size from front to back, a progression that is most easily seen in lateral view. In specimens conforming to this morphology, the crown of I2 is visibly smaller than or subequal to the crown of I3 ( fig. 17B ). However, in all examined specimens of T. tatei with unworn or lightly worn teeth, I2 is visibly larger that I3 ( fig. 17A ), an apparently unique trait of this species. STYLAR CUSP C: The stylar shelf of didelphid upper molars is provided with a series of five or six small cusps along the labial margin. By convention, these cusps are given alphabetic designations based on positional criteria (Clemens, 1966) . The most consistently recognizable are stylar cusp B (labial to the paracone) and stylar cusp D (labial to the metacone). One or two small cusps that are posterolabial to the paracone and anterolabial to the metacone correspond to stylar cusp(s) C. In some species of Thylamys, there is no distinct cusp in the C position, and in these taxa the ectoflexus (a labial indentation in the stylar shelf) is deeper and more distinct than it is in taxa with stylar cusp C. The presence of stylar cusp C contributes to the ''serrated'' appearance of the stylar shelf as noted by authors (Solari, 2003; Carmignoto and Monfort, 2006) .",

METACONULE: The metaconule, a small but taxonomically important occlusal element of the primitive tribosphenic molar bauplan (Simpson, 1936) , is absent or indistinct in most didelphids (Voss and Jansa, 2009) , as it is in most species of Thylamys. In species conforming with this widespread opossum phenotype (including T. elegans, T. karimii, T. pallidior, T. sponsorius, T. tatei, and T. venustus; table 13), the metaconule appears (if at all) only as a small chevron on the postprotocrista that is just barely visible when the newly erupted or lightly worn teeth of juveniles and subadults are viewed under high magnification; presumably because such diminutive structures are quickly obliterated by wear, adult teeth seldom retain any clearly identifiable vestige of the metaconule. By contrast, the metaconule is often substantially larger and ontogenetically persistent in T. pusillus and T. velutinus, and a well-developed metaconule was likewise observed in the single specimen of T. macrurus that we were able to score for this character.",

Nasals usually very long (extending posteriorly beyond lacrimals); lacrimal foramina partially exposed to lateral view on orbital margin in most specimens; infraorbital foramen above P3; nasolabial fossa usually shallow (deeply excavated in a few specimens); supraorbital margins beaded; maxillary fenestrae present; crown of second upper incisor (I2) smaller than or subequal to crown of I3; stylar cusp C often present on M1 and M2; metaconule indistinct or absent on M3. COMPARISONS: Thylamys karimii can be distinguished unambiguously from T. velutinus, the only other member of the subgenus Xerodelphys, by its self-white ventral pelage (the ventral pelage is entirely gray based in velutinus), and complete lack of plantar dermatoglyphs (vestigial dermatoglyphs are present at the apex of each plantar pad in velutinus). Cranial character differences are difficult to evaluate with the small samples at hand, but the nasal bones appear to be absolutely longer on average (NL 5 11.6-13.4 mm; N 5 5) in karimii than in velutinus (LN 5 11.3-11.7 mm; N 5 3) and they usually project posteriorly well behind the lacrimals (the nasals do not extend posteriorly beyond the lacrimals in any examined specimen of velutinus; table 7). Although we observed supraorbital beads in karimii that we did not see in velutinus, Carmignotto and Monfort (2006) reported beaded interorbitals in specimens of velutinus that we have not examined. Whereas metaconules were indistinct or absent in all three specimens of karimii that we were able to score confidently for this character, distinct metaconules were present in all five scored specimens of velutinus (table 13) .",

                "text": "REMARKS: Originally described as a valid species by Petter (1968) , karimii was subsequently listed as a synonym of Thylamys pusillus by Gardner (1993) , whereas Palma (1995) and Solari (2003) treated it as a synonym of T. velutinus. Carmignotto and Monfort (2006) effectively refuted these synonymies by identifying most of the characters that we now recognize as distinguishing karimii from other species of Thylamys (table 15) . Three specimens of small didelphids collected near Exu in the Brazilian state of Cear\u00e1 were misidentified as Marmosa karimii by Mares et al. (1981) and Streilein (1982) . The single specimen from this series that we examined (CM 80015, from 0.5 km S Exu) is an old adult male Gracilinanus agilis, whereas two others examined by A.P. Carmignotto (in litt., 8 March 2010) are Cryptonanus agricolai: one is MZUSP 16610 (an immature female from Fazenda Guaran\u00ed, 2.9 km N Exu), and the other is MZUSP 16961 (an adult male from Escola Agricola, 0.7 km S Exu). Behavioral observations based on these specimens were erroneously attributed to Thylamys karimii by Creighton and Gardner (2008) despite Palma's (1995) Carmignotto and Monfort (2006) . The most consistently useful of these are summarized in the preceding species account. REMARKS: Although velutinus has always been recognized as a valid species, other forms have been regarded as junior synonyms by authors. Of these, only pimelurus is clearly conspecific (Tate, 1933; Carmignotto and Monfort, 2006) . By contrast, formosa Shamel, 1930, listed as a subspecies of velutinus by Cabrera (1958) , is a morphologically distinctive taxon of still-uncertain phylogenetic relationships; it is currently referred to the monotypic genus Chacodelphys (see Voss et al., 2004; Voss and Jansa, 2009 Carmignotto and Monfort (2006: fig. 7 ), Creighton and Gardner (2008: map 50) , and fig. 3 ). Additional Brazilian records that we assume to be valid were reported by C\u00e1 ceres et al. (2007) . As noted by , a Bolivian record (in Anderson, 1997 ) and a record from NE Argentina (mapped by Brown, 2004) are based on misidentifications. Voss et al. (2009: 417-418) discussed the problematic ecological interpretation of capture records for this species, which has been taken in arborescent Cerrado habitats in Brazil but in second-growth moist forest in Paraguay. This species is not known to occur sympatrically with any other congener. MORPHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS: Body pelage tricolored (abrupt line of transition from darker middorsal to paler lateral coloration present); ventral pelage self-white (or -whitish), usually with narrow lateral zones of gray-based fur; plantar pads of manus separate, surrounding concave central palmar surface, and with well-developed dermatoglyphs; manual claws short, not extending much if at all beyond fleshy apical pads of digits; tail much longer than combined length of head and body (LT/HBL 3 100 5 123%; N 5 5), with pale tip (terminal 10-50 mm whitish above and below); ventral prehensile surface of tail tip well developed. Nasal bones long (extending posteriorly as far as lacrimals) or very long (extending posteriorly beyond lacrimals); lacrimal foramina partially exposed on orbital margin or concealed inside orbit; infraorbital foramen above P3 or above P3/M1 commissure; nasolabial fossa shallow; supraorbital margins usually beaded, the beads sometimes developed as postorbital processes in old adult males; maxillary fenestrae present; crown of second upper incisor (I2) smaller than or subequal to crown of I3; stylar cusp C almost always present on M1 and M2; metaconule distinct on M3 (but only one specimen confidently scored for this trait). COMPARISONS: Thylamys macrurus has been described as the largest species in the genus (Solari, 2003; Carmignotto and Monfort, 2006) , but it exhibits broad morphometric overlap with some species in the Elegans and Venustus groups, from which it is more readily distinguished by qualitative external and craniodental characters (table 16). Within the nominotypical subgenus, macrurus is qualitatively similar to pusillus (both species usually have beaded supraorbital margins, maxillary fenestrae, stylar cusp C on M1 and M2, and a distinct metaconule on M3), but macrurus is much larger (e.g., with nonoverlapping molar measurements; table 16), usually has narrow lateral zones of gray-based ventral fur (the ventral pelage is entirely self-white in pusillus), a pale tail tip (usually absent in pusillus), and shorter posterolateral palatal foramina (see Carmignotto and Monfort, 2006: fig. 6 ).",

A detailed morphological description based on freshly collected Brazilian material was provided by Carmignotto and Monfort (2006) Bolivia, western Paraguay, and northern Argentina. Based on material that we examined, the distribution of Thylamys pusillus is almost coextensive with the tropical and subtropical dry forests and savannas collectively known as the Chaco, but a few collection localities (in the Argentine provinces of Mendoza, Misiones, and San Luis) are just outside the limits of the Chaco as that biome is conventionally recognized by authors (e.g., Short, 1975) . Records of this species from Patagonian habitats (Birney et al., 1996) are based on misidentifications, as are Anderson's (1997) records from high elevations in the Bolivian department of Chuquisaca (see Remarks, below) and, apparently, a single published record from Uruguay (Gonz\u00e1 lez et al., 2000; see Teta et al., 2009 ). Brown's (2004: fig. 88 ) map of the range of T. pusillus includes numerous extralimital records, all of which are apparently based on misidentifications or erroneous synonymies. 3 The known geographic range of Thylamys pusillus overlaps that of T. pallidior in northern Argentina, where the two species have been collected sympatrically in the Reserva Bi\u00f3 sfera de \u00d1 acu\u00f1 \u00e1 n (ca. 34uS, 68uW) in Mendoza province. The range of T. pusillus also overlaps that of T. venustus in southeastern Bolivia, where these species have been collected sympatrically near Carandayt\u00ed (gazetteer locality 44) in Chuquisaca department, and near Villa Montes (21u159S, 63u309W) in Tarija department.",

Additionally, pusillus is, on average, shorter furred than pallidior. Among 53 measured adult specimens of pusillus, the middorsal fur ranges in length from 6-11 mm, but most specimens (79%) have middorsal fur that is only 7-9 mm long.

Although a couple of millimeters' difference in average fur length does not sound like much, the contrast is visibly and tactilely apparent with representative specimens of both species in hand.

Because the collection localities of sequenced specimens of Thylamys pusillus are spatially clustered with large intervening areas from which no sequence data are available ( fig. 7) , geographic sampling bias is a possible explanation for the seemingly distinct groups in our cytochrome-b analyses. Nevertheless, sequence divergence among these haplogroups is impressive: 6.8% between haplogroup A and haplogroup B, 7.6% between haplogroup A and haplogroup C, and 5.8% between haplogroup B and haplogroup C. If these really are conspecific mitochondrial lineages, they are old ones. In the event that diagnostic morphological criteria are eventually found to reliably distinguish these haplogroups, we discuss the application of available names in the paragraphs that follow. Haplogroup A, represented in our analyses by samples from southeastern Bolivia and western Paraguay, corresponds to Thylamys pusillus in the strict sense of , who designated a neotype from the Paraguayan department of Boquer\u00f3 n; nanus is an objective junior synonym (based on the same type material); and verax, a subjective junior synonym, is also based on a western Paraguayan type (table 14). conjectured that typical pusillus might be restricted to the tropical and subtropical dry forests north of the R\u00edo Pilcomayo, from which measured specimens seem to be larger (with upper molar tooth rows . 5 mm) than specimens collected south of the Pilcomayo-in Argentina-which are mostly smaller (with tooth rows , 5 mm). However, a previously unexamined USNM series from Fort\u00edn Guachalla (22u279S, 62u209W) on the north bank of the Pilcomayo is geographically intermediate to the material examined by , and it is also morphologically intermediate (with LM 5 4.9-5.3 mm), suggesting that geographic variation is clinal rather than abrupt, and that the Pilcomayo does not separate morphologically distinctive forms.",

Although the type locality of bruchi is in the Argentine province of San Luis, from which no additional pusillus-like material is known to have been collected, the subadult holotype (BMNH 21.4.21.8) has all the distinguishing characteristics of pusillus, including short claws, an infraorbital foramen that is dorsal to P3, distinct maxillary fenestrae, a welldeveloped stylar cusp C on M1 and M2, and a well-developed metaconule on M3. The name pulchellus (based on a specimen from Santiago del Estero; table 14) also applies to this haplogroup according to Teta et al. (2009) , but we have not examined the type. thought that bruchi might be distinct from pusillus based on the smaller size of specimens collected south of the Pilcomayo by comparison with specimens collected in Paraguay and Bolivia, and because they observed correlated geographic variation in the frequency of stylar cusp C on M3. As discussed above, however, newly examined material suggests that geographic size variation in this complex is clinal and does not provide a satisfactory basis for identifying unsequenced specimens. Representative voucher specimens of haplogroup B are, in fact, smaller than vouchers of haplogroup A (table 17) , but observed metrical differences are small, and stylar cusp C occurs polymorphically on M3 in voucher material of both haplogroups. Because close scrutiny has not revealed additional phenotypic differences between specimens that might be referred to bruchi on the one hand and to pusillus on the other, it seems appropriate to adopt the taxonomically conservative view that these are conspecific forms.",

(1996) , who reported finding two distinct phenotypes in 4 Creighton and Gardner (2008: 114) alleged that ''marmota Thomas, 1896'' is a senior synonym of citellus, but Thomas's (1896) use of marmota Oken, 1816-an unavailable name based on Azara's fourth opossum (the Paraguayan species currently known as Thylamys macrurus; Voss et al., 2009)-for Argentinian material was a misidentification that he subsequently corrected (Thomas, 1912) . Because Thomas (1896) was not proposing a new name, his citation of a previous description (Thomas, 1894) to clarify the application of Oken's epithet cannot be construed as a nomenclaturally valid indication in the sense of the Code (ICZN, 1999: Article 12) . material they collected in ''Monte'' and ''Patagonian'' habitats of Chubut province, Argentina. However, we examined Birney at al.'s material (in the MMNH) and found no morphological differences between their Monte and Patagonian series. The morphometric variation among adult MMNH specimens from Chubut is well within the normal range of intraspecific variation in Thylamys, and both series conform qualitatively to our diagnosis of T. pallidior. 5 No speci-men in either series resembles T. pusillus. Unfortunately, tissue samples from Birney at al.'s Chubut material (which may still exist in a freezer at Texas Tech University; C.J. Phillips, personal commun.) could not be obtained for our sequencing study.

(1996) claimed that their Monte and Patagonian series differed in pelage traits (fur color and texture) and in the position of the infraorbital foramen above the maxillary tooth row. However, three of their four Monte specimens are juveniles with obviously immature pelage; their single Monte adult (MMNH 15722) closely resembles Patagonian specimens in pelage characteristics. Apparently, the authors mistook dP3 for M1 when they recorded the position of the infraorbital foramen above the tooth row in their Monte juveniles. The position of the infraorbital foramen in MMNH 15722 is indistinguishable from the morphology seen in their Patagonian series (above stylar cusp B of M1) 261268; MSB 55846); Santa Cruz, 53 km E of Boyuibe (AMNH 275441; MSB 87105), Tita (AMNH 260025); Tarija, Estancia Bol\u00edvar (AMNH 275440, 275442, 275445, 275446; MSB 67016-67018, 87103, 87104), 8 km S [and] 10 km E Villa Montes (AMNH 246442-246444, 246446-246449, 246452 ",

DISTRIBUTION: As restricted by authors (Meynard et al., 2002; Solari, 2003; Braun et al., 2005; Creighton and Gardner, 2008) and as recognized in this report, Thylamys elegans is endemic to central Chile, where its distributional limits remain to be convincingly documented. Examined specimens that we refer to this species were collected between about 30u and 36uS (in the regions of Coquimbo, Valpara\u00edso, Metropolitana, and Maule), from near sea level to about 1000 m. As noted by Palma (1995) , the specimens reported from much lower latitudes and/or higher elevations in northern Chile (Atacama and Tarapac\u00e1 ) by Pine et al. (1979) are referable to T. pallidior. Although Creighton and Gardner (2008: 110) did not map any northern Chilean localities for T. elegans, the elevational range that they attributed to this species (''from sea level to over 3500 m'') was presumably based on Pine et al.'s (1979) misidentified material. The type of soricinus is said to have been collected near Valdivia (ca. 40uS), but no additional specimens have apparently been collected so far to the south (Palma, 1997) .",

Nasal bones usually short (not extending posteriorly as far as the lacrimals); lacrimal foramina usually exposed anterior to orbit or partially exposed on orbital rim; infraorbital foramen above P3/M1 commissure or above M1; nasolabial fossa shallow; supraorbital margins usually rounded or squared; maxillary fenestrae consistently absent; crown of second upper incisor (I2) smaller than or subequal to crown of I3; stylar cusp C almost always absent on M1 and M2; metaconule absent or indistinct on M3. COMPARISONS: Thylamys elegans can be distinguished unambiguously from T. pallidior by its much broader lateral zones of gray-based ventral fur, which are equal to or wider than the median streak of self-colored fur (versus much narrower than the selfcolored zone in pallidior). Additionally, the self-colored ventral fur of elegans is usually off-white (''cream'') or even yellowish, whereas the self-colored ventral fur of pallidior is snowy white. Other characters contribute to the phenotypic distinctness of these species, although none provides a sufficient basis for identification by itself: elegans has, on average, larger hind feet (14-17 mm) than pallidior (12-15 mm) , longer manual and pedal digits, shorter nasals (table 7) , and less inflated auditory bullae. Digital lengths are difficult to measure (we did not attempt to do so), but the longer fingers and toes of elegans are apparent in most side-by-side comparisons. Bullar size is indexed by the ratio of bullar width to interbullar width (BW/IBW; see fig. 2 ), a proportion that averages 0. 85 6 0.05 SD (N 5 23) in elegans and 0. 98 6 0.07 SD (N 5 44) in pallidior. Thylamys elegans externally resembles T. tatei in having wide lateral zones of graybased ventral fur, but these species can be distinguished unambiguously by incisor morphology. Whereas the crown of I2 is consistently smaller than or subequal to the crown of I3 in elegans, the crown of I2 is consistently larger than the crown of I3 in tatei ( fig. 17) . Additionally, the nasals of elegans are usually shorter than those of tatei (table 7) ; one or both lacrimal foramina are usually exposed in elegans, whereas both foramina are concealed in tatei (table 8) ; and the infraorbital foramen of elegans is usually positioned over M1, whereas the foramen is often over P3 in tatei (table 9) . Among the integumental differences that Solari (2003) observed between elegans and tatei, the usual presence of a pale tail tip in tatei and its absence in elegans is the most consistently useful; we did not observe conspicuous differences between these taxa in fur length (10-12 mm middorsally in most examined specimens of both species), dorsal pelage pigmentation, or facial markings.",

All of the distinctive traits of coquimbensis mentioned by Tate (1931 Tate ( , 1933 including its pale dorsal coloration, mostly white ventral fur, small feet, and large bullae-are consistent with the diagnostic traits that we attribute to T. pallidior. Sideby-side comparisons of FMNH 22302 with examples of typical T. elegans (which also occurs in Coquimbo; e.g., FMNH 119487) are likewise consistent with the suite of differences that distinguish these species (see Comparisons, above). The occurrence of both species in Coquimbo suggests that they may occur sympatrically there, perhaps somewhere in between Paiguano (30u019S, 70u329W; the type locality of coquimbensis) and Parque Nacional Fray Jorge (30u309S, 71u309W; our northernmost record of T. elegans). We have not examined the type of soricinus, whose widely assumed synonymy with elegans still needs to be confirmed. The type of soricinus, a mounted skin with the skull inside, was last seen by Osgood (1943) , who noted that it differed from typical elegans by lacking the continuous median streak of self-whitish fur seen in the latter form; instead, he described the ventral surface of the type of soricinus as entirely covered by gray-based buffy hairs. The only Chilean specimens we examined that fit this description are a small series from Maule (USNM 541587-541591) from which, unfortunately, we have no sequence data. Pine et al. (1979) previously examined this series and concluded that it represents the soricinus phenotype. We agree, but because the Maule specimens are indistinguishable from typical elegans in measurements and qualitative craniodental traits, no taxonomic distinction seems warranted at this time.",

Nasal bones variable in length (without any clearly modal condition; table 7); lacrimal foramina often partially exposed on orbital rim; infraorbital foramen usually above M1 but sometimes above P3/M1 commissure (apparently never above P3); nasolabial fossa shallow; supraorbital margins usually rounded or squared; maxillary fenestrae almost always absent; crown of second upper incisor Qualitatively, these species are most readily distinguished by their ventral pelage (almost completely self-white in pallidior, with broad lateral zones of gray-based hairs in tatei) and by upper incisor morphology (the crown of I2 is consistently smaller than or about the same size as the crown of I3 in pallidior, whereas the crown of I2 is consistently larger than the crown of I3 in tatei; fig. 17 ). REMARKS: As previously reported by Braun et al. (2005) , cytochrome-b sequence variation in this species is geographically structured. In particular, our results confirm those authors' discovery of two allopatric haplotype groups with distributions that are juxtaposed at or near the border between Bolivia and Argentina ( fig. 5 ). Although this basal dichotomy is moderately well supported by nodal statistics ( fig. 4 ), we are unable to distinguish representative voucher specimens by any morphological criterion (univariate metrical comparisons are summarized in table 20), and we therefore treat these haplogroups as conspecific. Nevertheless, names are available for each of them should future research justify their recognition as distinct taxa. In that event, pallidior (based on a Bolivian specimen; table 14) unambiguously applies to haplogroup A, and fenestrae (based on an Argentinian specimen) could be used for haplogroup B. According to Martin (2009) , however, fenestrae is a distinct species restricted to the Argentinian provinces of Buenos Aires, C\u00f3 rdoba, and La Pampa. Our only tissue samples from these areas (AC 47, LTU 77) are vouchered by morphological specimens that we have not examined, but the sequences we obtained from them are intermingled in our tree ( fig. 4 ) with sequences from specimens collected in other provinces. Although we have not examined any of the morphological material that Martin (2009) referred to fenestrae, our results suggest that the application of this name merits closer scrutiny. Specimens of other Thylamys species have sometimes been misidentified as T. pallidior. For example, Anderson's (1997: 29) key does not reliably distinguish T. pallidior from other Bolivian congeners, and his range maps include several records that fall outside the range of that species as we recognize it. Although we were not able to see every Bolivian specimen that Anderson identified as T. pallidior, all of those that we examined from the departments of Cochabamba (e.g., AMNH 275427, MSB 87109) , La Paz (e.g., AMNH 248704), and Santa Cruz (e.g., AMNH 260030) are unambiguously referable to T. venustus (see below).",

Some of these (e.g., MVZ 116614; from 3 mi W Atico in Arequipa department; fig. 5 , locality 98) are morphologically similar to pallidior (with mostly self-white underparts), whereas others (e.g., MVZ 137585; from Lima department; fig. 5 , locality 103) differ from typical pallidior by having broad lateral zones of graybased hairs bordering a narrower median streak of self-white fur. Cytochrome-b sequences that we amplified from museum skins of these and other unidentified specimens from southwestern Peru are highly divergent from pallidior and form a monophyletic group with two sequences of T. tatei ( fig. 4 ). Indeed, one of these specimens (MVZ 119913; also from Lima department; fig. 5 , locality 102) resembles tatei and differs from other (more pallidior-like) Peruvian specimens by having a white-tipped tail and very long nasal bones. Although these results are (87-100) 4 91 (73-103) 5 99 (97-104) 3 95 (87-103) 2 LT112 (108-115) 4 105 (97-110) 5 112 (107-118) 3 105 (103-107) 2 HF14 (13-15) 5 14 (13-15) 6 14 (13-15) 3 14 (13-14) 2 Ear24 (20-28) 5 22 (20-24) 6 24 (23-25) 3 22 (22-23) 2 CBL27.9 (26.4-30 .1) 5 27.0 (25.4-28.4) 4 27.3 (26.5-27.9) 3 26.3 (25.1-27. 2) 3 NL 12.0 (11.7-12.4) 2 11.2 (10.6-11.6) 3 11.2 (11.1-11.4 Gardner (1993) . Although our results are obviously consistent with recent inferences from molecular and morphological studies that tatei and elegans are distinct species (Meynard et al., 2002; Palma et al., 2002; Solari, 2003; Braun et al., 2005) , other taxonomic problems remain. Foremost among these is the identification of specimens from the Peruvian provinces of Lima (e.g., MVZ 119913, 137585) and Huancavelica (e.g., MVZ 136249) that resemble tatei in having broad lateral zones of graybased ventral fur but which lack some of the diagnostic craniodental traits of tatei and have divergent mtDNA sequences. Although Solari (2003) identified these as pallidior (as discussed above), they cluster with tatei in our phylogenetic analyses. ",

Gardner (1993) listed cinderella, sponsorius, and venustus as synonyms of Thylamys elegans, but allozyme data reported by Palma and Yates (1998) suggested that venustus-the name they used for Bolivian populations of ''elegans'' (sensu Gardner, 1993)-was a distinct species. Subsequently, Flores et al. (2000) recognized three Argentine species of Thylamys with gray-based ventral fur, for which they used T. cinderella, T. sponsorius, and T. venustus as valid binomials. However, cinderella and sponsorius were synonymized again by Braun et al. (2005) , who found genetic evidence for only two Argentine species of Thylamys with gray-based ventral fur, one corresponding to the phenotype that Flores et al. called venustus and the other containing specimens that Flores et al. had identified as cinderella and sponsorius. Gardner (2005) and Creighton and Gardner (2008) recognized T. cinderella, T. sponsorius, and T. venustus (including janetta) as valid following Flores et al. (2000) , but Voss and Jansa (2009) followed Braun et al. (2005) in recognizing only T. cinderella (including sponsorius) and T. venustus (including janetta) as valid species. Our use of the name sponsorius is based on the morphometric analysis described above, which unambiguously associates the holotype (BMNH 21.1.1.85, an adult male from Sunchal, in the Sierra de Santa B\u00e1 rbara of southeastern Jujuy, Argentina; Thomas, 1921) with the cytochrome-b clade that has larger average measurements.

Tate (1933: 221) also recognized M. janetta as a valid species and said that it was ''the mountain representative of the marmota radiation'' (marmota being an unavailable synonym of T. macrurus; see . Subsequently, Cabrera (1958) included janetta without comment in the synonymy of M. elegans venusta. Most subsequent authors (e.g., Solari, 2003; Gardner, 2005; Creighton and Gardner, 2008) have listed janetta as a synonym of T. venustus, but the justification for this synonymy has never been explained.",

                "text": "We examined the holotype of janetta (BMNH 26.1.1.167, from Carlazo), several topotypic paratypes (BMNH 26.1.1.166, 26.1.1.168-26.1.1.170; FMNH 29169, 29170) and several recently collected topotypes (UMMZ 155836, 156034-156036) . Oddly, all of these specimens are very old adults with heavily worn molars. The advanced age of these specimens plausibly explains the large size attributed to janetta by Thomas (1926) and Tate (1933) ; this conclusion is supported by the fact that whereas continuously growing dimensions seem unusually large in this series (e.g., CBL: 29.7-31.6 mm), age-invariant measurements do not (e.g., LM: 5.7-6.0 mm). Other distinctive attributes of this nominal species, however, are harder to explain as age-related, including its mostly self-white ventral coloration, white hind feet, and short posterolateral palatal foramina (which, unlike most other Thylamys, do not extend anteriorly to the level of the protocone of M4). In other respects, janetta resembles other forms that we assign to the Venustus Group; for example, the type and all examined topotypes have short claws, and maxillary fenestrae are bilaterally present. Our primary justification for synonymizing janetta with sponsorius are partial (609-812 bp) cytochrome-b sequences amplified from a paratype (FMNH 29170) and a topotype (UMMZ 155836) of janetta. Despite the unusual features of their morphological vouchers (as noted above), the sequences we obtained from FMNH 29170 and UMMZ 155836 cluster with other Tarija sequences that we obtained from phenotypically sponsorius-like specimens ( fig. 8 ). Although we are not able to confidently explain all of the odd traits that characterize examined specimens from Carlazo, we assume that they are ontogenetic artifacts and/or local peculiarities, perhaps of a small and closely inbred population. Flores et al. (2000 Flores et al. ( , 2007 recognized Thylamys cinderella, T. sponsorius, and T. venustus as distinct species that could be identified by diagnostic morphometric and qualitative criteria. However, none of their relevant key couplets (Flores et al., 2000: 334) accurately distinguish voucher specimens representing the two mitochondrial clades recovered in our analysis of cytochrome-b sequence data. Additionally, we sequenced one specimen that they identified as T. sponsorius (AMNH 185323) and another that they identified as T. cinderella (AMNH 186948); according to our phylogenetic analyses, both specimens belong to haplogroup C of the species we identify as T. venustus. Thylamys venustus (Thomas, 1902) SYNONYMS: cinderella Thomas, 1902 . DISTRIBUTION: Based on specimens that we sequenced, Thylamys venustus occurs along the eastern slopes and foothills of the Andes from Bolivia (Cochabamba, Chuquisaca, Santa Cruz, and Tarija) to northwestern Argentina (Jujuy and Tucum\u00e1 n; fig. 9 ) with recorded elevations ranging from about 350 to 4000 m above sea level. Although we have not investigated every published extralimital record of this species, those from Lima, Peru (Tate, 1933) and Oruro, Bolivia (Anderson, 1997) appear to be based on misidentified material (see Remarks). Gardner's (2005) record from Neuqu\u00e9n, Argentina, was based on an editing error (A.L. Gardner, in litt., 23 February 2010) . The known geographic range of Thylamys venustus overlaps those of T. pallidior, T. pusillus, and T. sponsorius; known cases of sympatry among these species have already been described in preceding accounts.",

Nasal bones usually extending posteriorly as far as or behind lacrimals; lacrimal foramina variable in position (no unambiguously modal condition observed among sequenced specimens); infraorbital foramen usually above P3 or above P3/M1 commissure; nasolabial fossa shallow; supra-ecogeographic trait evolution in the genus will be provided elsewhere, some preliminary inferences are appropriately mentioned here. The first concerns the constraining role of the Andes, the principal topographic feature of the South American continent. All of the closest outgroups to Thylamys (e.g., Chacodelphys and Lestodelphys; see Voss and Jansa, 2009) occur east of the Andes, as does the subgenus Xerodelphys, T. (Thylamys) macrurus, the entire Venustus Group, and T. (T.) pusillus, so the most recent common ancestor of Thylamys was almost certainly also cis-Andean. Additionally, our phylogenetic topology suggests that that the Andes were initially traversed by the ancestral lineage of the Elegans Group, and that a single lineage of T. pallidior subsequently reinvaded the eastern lowlands ( fig. 12 ). The almost complete absence of phylogeographic structure in haplogroup B of T. pallidior ( fig. 4 ) suggests that its cis-Andean range expansion was both rapid and relatively recent.",

REMARKS: Diligent visual and morphometric comparisons of voucher material has not allowed us to discover any phenotypic attribute that distinguishes the three allopatric haplogroups of Thylamys venustus designated A, B, and C in figures 8 and 10. The skins, skulls, and dentitions assignable to those groups are qualitatively similar and overlap broadly in all recorded measurements. In effect, they appear to represent a single morphological species. Despite the apparent absence of diagnostic morphological traits, however, available names can tentatively be assigned to two of them based on geographic criteria: the type locality of venustus (in the Bolivian department of Cochabamba; table 14) falls within the known range of the haplogroup A, whereas the type locality of cinderella (in the Argentinian province of Tucum\u00e1 n) falls within the known range of haplogroup C. Apparently, no name is currently available for haplogroup B. We examined one of the two specimens that Tate (1933: 225) identified as Marmosa venusta from the Peruvian department of Lima, on the wrong (western) side of the Andes and over 1000 km from the nearest collection locality of any material conforming to T. venustus as recognized herein. The specimen in question (FMNH 24141), a juvenile male skin and skull collected in 1922 by J.T. Zimmer at Matucana (11u519S, 76u249W, 2378 m; Stephens and Traylor, 1983) , has a relatively short tail (108% of HBL), long claws, and a narrow but continuous median streak of self-white ventral fur flanked by broad lateral zones of gray-based hairs, traits that better match the characteristics we associate with the Elegans Group than those we associate with the Venustus Group (table 16) . Solari (2003) examined this specimen and identified it as T. pallidior, but we believe it to represent one of the unnamed phenotypes related to T. tatei, as discussed above in the account for the latter species.Three specimens from the Bolivian department of Oruro that Anderson (1997) ",

Contrary to his assessment (which was not based on any substantive analysis of character data), the existence of multiple species is clearly indicated by diagnostic morphological differences and high sequence divergence (up to 16% in uncorrected pairwise cytochrome-b comparisons; table 6) among numerous robustly supported mitochondrial clades. Whereas some of the species recognized as valid in this report are allopatric, others are known to occur sympatrically in various combinations (table 25) , providing additional support for the notion that these are evolutionarily independent (reproductively isolated) lineages.Indeed, many of the vexing problems that previously hampered taxonomic understanding of the genus are now resolved beyond any reasonable doubt. For example, our results unambiguously support Palma and Yates' (1998) hypothesis that T. venustus is a distinct species from T. elegans, Carmignotto and Monfort's (2006) conclusion that T. karimii is a distinct species from both T. pusillus and T. velutinus, and Solari's (2003) treatment of T. tatei as a distinct species from T. elegans. On the other hand, several problematic issues remain, among them the probable existence of unnamed forms of the Elegans Group in western Peru, the taxonomic status of allopatric haplogroups that we synonymize with T. pusillus, and the morphological diagnosability of geographically overlapping sister taxa that we recognize as T. venustus and T. sponsorius. In our opinion, these enigmas are unlikely to be resolved to anyone's satisfaction until additional data (e.g., better geographic sampling, nuclear-gene sequences, new morphological characters) become available.Despite the fact that a few key nodes remain weakly supported, phylogenetic relationships among species of Thylamys are completely resolved by the mitochondrial sequence data analyzed in this report ( fig. 11 ). Because this is the first phylogenetic study to include all of the valid species of Thylamys, our results provide a uniquely appropriate framework for biogeographic inference.

COMPARISONS: Comparisons of Thylamys pallidior with T. pusillus and T. elegans are summarized in the preceding species accounts. Thylamys pallidior differs from the only other currently recognized species in the Elegans Group, T. tatei, in size and qualitative characters. Although pallidior is, on average, smaller than tatei in all measured dimensions, age-invariant molar measurements provide the best univariate index for this comparison: mean length of the upper molar row (LM, see fig. 2) is 5.7 6 0.2 mm S.D.
