Yet, detailed knowledge of the spatial footprints of these threats is lacking, including where they overlap and how they change over time. These knowledge gaps are real barriers for effective conservation planning. Here, we develop a novel approach to reconstruct the individual and combined footprints of both threats over time. We combine satellitebased land-cover change maps, habitat suitability models and hunting pressure models to demonstrate our approach for the community of larger mammals (48 species > 1 kg) across the 1.1 million km 2 Gran Chaco region, a global deforestation hotspot covering parts of Argentina, Bolivia and Paraguay. This provides three key insights. First, we find that the footprints of habitat destruction and hunting pressure expanded considerably between 1985 and 2015, across ~40% of the entire Chaco -twice the area affected by deforestation. Second, both threats increasingly acted together within the ranges of larger mammals in the Chaco (17% increase on average, \u00b1 20% SD, cumulative increase of co-occurring threats across 465 000 km 2 ), suggesting large synergistic effects. Conversely, core areas of high-quality habitats declined on average by 38%. Third, we identified remaining priority areas for conservation in the northern and central Chaco, many of which are outside the protected area network. We also identify hotspots of high threat impacts in central Paraguay and northern Argentina, providing",

On the other hand, overexploitation (i.e. the unsustainable hunting, collection of animals and plants, logging or fishing) (IPBES 2019), expands rapidly as the global human population grows, affluence increases and demand for wild animals and plants (e.g. meat, live specimens) increases (Ben\u00edtez-L\u00f3pez et al. 2017 .

                "text": "Assessing the spatial footprint of threats to biodiversity, how these footprints overlap, where they remain absent, and how they change over time -which we here collectively refer to as the 'geographies of threat' -can help understand the individual and combined effects of those threats. Understanding geographies of threat is also imperative for guiding conservation planning by identifying where threat-specific conservation actions should take place (Wilson et al. 2005 , Pressey et al. 2007 . However, mapping the geographies of threat is challenging. Few studies have mapped multiple threats at broad scales; typically within the scope of single-species studies (Bleyhl et al. 2015 , Romero-Mu\u00f1oz et al. 2019b , which has limited value for conservation planning that targets wider biodiversity facets (Nicholson and Possingham 2006) . Studies assessing broader groups of species on the other hand, usually rely on IUCN's expert-based threat categorizations and range maps, thereby assuming that threats impact multiple species uniformly (Allan et al. 2019 , Gallego-Zamorano et al. 2020 , which is too simplistic. In addition, expert-based range maps contain false presences and vary tremendously in quality, depending on regions and taxa, and their use is therefore limited to very coarse resolutions (Ficetola et al. 2014 , Di Marco et al. 2017 . Consequently, these approaches are insufficient to inform threat-specific management actions on the ground (Wilson et al. 2005 , Tulloch et al. 2015 . New approaches to map the species-specific responses to threats for multiple species simultaneously and at resolutions useful for practitioners are urgently needed (Wilson et al. 2005 , Pressey et al. 2007 , Tulloch et al. 2015 .",

Such hunting pressure models synthesise knowledge across local studies, to describe how species-specific responses to hunting vary across landscapes (Ben\u00edtez-L\u00f3pez et al. 2019) .

                "text": "Understanding of the interacting footprints of habitat destruction and hunting is particularly poor in tropical deforestation frontiers, where rapid habitat destruction often couples with high hunting pressure (Peres 2001 , Ben\u00edtez-L\u00f3pez et al. 2019 . This situation is particularly dire in the world's tropical dry forests, which are vanishing quickly across the globe (Hoekstra et al. 2005 , Curtis et al. 2018 . However, these systems remain weakly protected (Miles et al. 2006) and under-researched (Blackie et al. 2014) . The individual and combined impacts of habitat destruction and hunting on biodiversity in these forests are highly unclear, translating into a real barrier towards implementing conservation planning and action. At 1.1 million km 2 , the Gran Chaco region (hereafter Chaco) in South America, extending into parts of Argentina, Paraguay and Bolivia, is the largest continuous tropical and subtropical dry forest globally, but it has recently turned into a global deforestation hotspot due to rapid agricultural expansion across the several deforestation frontiers that it encompasses (Baumann et al. 2017 , Curtis et al. 2018 , Le Polain de Waroux et al. 2018 . At the same time, hunting is very widespread there, causing massive defaunation (Noss et al. 2005 , Altrichter 2006 , Periago et al. 2014 . Together, these threats render the Chaco a global conservation priority (WWF 2015, Kuemmerle et al. 2017) . Increasing evidence suggests important interactions between habitat destruction and hunting in this region. For example, large mammals disappear from remaining forest patches soon after the surrounding areas are deforested because they are easily hunted out (N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Regueiro et al. 2015 , Semper-Pascual et al. 2019 . Likewise, cattle ranchers in areas where pastures expand often persecute large predators over fears of attacks on cattle (Quiroga et al. 2016 , Romero-Mu\u00f1oz et al. 2019b ). Yet, our understanding of how these threats play out and interact in space is very limited.",

This allows to assess the footprints of habitat destruction and hunting and to identify threat hotspots as well as how they change over time. Specifically, we aimed to answer the following questions: 1) how have the footprints of habitat destruction and hunting pressure on larger mammals changed in the Chaco since 1985? 2) What is the relative importance, in terms of the share of species' ranges affected and their overall footprints, of these two threats acting alone versus together, and how this has changed over time? 3) How has the distribution of core areas, where threats are absent, changed since 1985, and where are current hotspots of threats and priority areas for conservation?",

Second, a Gaussian model was fitted to the non-zero response ratios in abundance change due to hunting based on 3281 abundance estimates in hunted and non-hunted areas studies across the tropics (Ben\u00edtez-L\u00f3pez et al. 2019) (see Extended methods). This results in a hunting pressure index ranging from 0 (no decline in abundance) to 1 (total local extirpation). We re-fitted the original global model to Neotropical mammals only (n = 1945 abundance ratios) and then evaluated the predictive accuracy with 5-fold cross-validation with an 80%/20% training/testing set. We split our predictions into two categories of high (> 0.3), and low (\u2264 0.3) hunting pressure, based on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) criterion of 30% population decline due to threats that have not ceased that renders a species threatened (criterion A4, IUCN 2012). We assessed the accuracy of our model for predicting these hunting pressure categories using sensitivity and specificity.",

                "text": "Understanding the individual and combined effects of different threats to biodiversity is critical for identifying effective conservation interventions to halt biodiversity loss. Yet, we currently lack approaches to map the spatial footprints of threats at resolutions fine enough to be useful for conservation planning. By combining land-cover time series mapped from satellite imagery, habitat suitability models and hunting pressure models, we reconstructed the footprints of habitat destruction and hunting for the entire community of larger mammals of South America's Gran Chaco, a 1.1 million km 2 deforestation hotspot. We found that the footprints of both threats expanded considerably -and much more than deforestation alone -across the Chaco over three decades, producing a widespread loss of core areas. In addition, habitat destruction and hunting pressure acted simultaneously over increasing portions of the Chaco over time, suggesting that synergistic effects are becoming the norm. The priority areas and hotspots of threat that we identified point to key areas for larger mammals, where habitat protection and threatspecific management actions should swiftly be implemented to avoid further biodiversity loss. Overall, our findings suggest increasing synergistic effects between habitat destruction and hunting pressure in the Chaco, a situation likely common in many tropical deforestation frontiers around the world. Our work therefore highlights the urgent need to better understanding how these threats act on species in space and time, in other words, the geographies of threat to biodiversity. We here develop an effective and easily transferable approach to do so. The footprints of habitat destruction and hunting pressure expanded hugely across the Chaco between 1985 and 2015 for almost all mammals we assessed. This is exemplified by the cumulative footprints of threats expanded over more than double the area of forest and natural grassland loss in that period (142 600 and 31 700 km 2 , respectively) (Baumann et al. 2017) . The footprint of hunting pressure penetrated even further into remote areas, including protected areas, than habitat destruction. Hunting is the main cryptic disturbance for mammals, and often extends into otherwise 'intact' forests (Peres et al. 2016 , Ben\u00edtez-L\u00f3pez et al. 2019 . Similarly, the footprint of habitat destruction was also broader than that of deforestation, likely because small fragments are unsuitable for wide-ranging species, and because edge effects decrease resource availability close to deforested areas (Barlow et al. 2016) . Only a few forest patches remain in the Chaco that are large enough to be effectively remote from hunter access points and agricultural lands. Other studies in deforestation frontiers have also reported that anthropogenic disturbance can extend over much larger areas than the area undergoing deforestation alone (Peres et al. 2006 , Barlow et al. 2016 . Together, our results highlight that approximating threats by deforestation footprints alone (Ocampo-Pe\u00f1uela et al. 2016 , Symes et al. 2018 , Gallego-Zamorano et al. 2020 , or by using fixed distances from roads (Allan et al. 2019 ) may underestimate the footprints of threats substantially.",

The declines we detected in most species' core areas often contrast with their generally low-threat global conservation status (Supplementary material Appendix 1 Table A3 ), highlighting the importance of conducting such assessments at the regional level (de la Torre et al. 2018). Given the varied and key ecological roles of larger mammals, their disappearance can disturb ecosystem functioning, including seed dispersal, carbon storage and nutrient cycling (Dirzo et al. 2014 , Periago et al. 2014 . This also highlights the importance of the few large remaining core areas for the mammal community as a whole, which are likely to be the last places maintaining the original species assemblage and ecosystem functioning in the Chaco. This reinforces the recognition of the irreplaceable role of 'wilderness' and Indigenous territories in maintaining biodiversity (Ricketts et al. 2010 , Gibson et al. 2011 .

                "text": "A key result of our study was that areas where both threats act together cover increasingly larger portions of the Chaco. This is highly worrying because biodiversity declines even faster where threats synergise (Brook et al. 2008) . Such synergistic effects are particularly likely in the Chaco, because its dense and thorny forests make them very hard to access for hunters unless forests are cleared for roads and agriculture. Hunters often kill mammals crossing such clearings; and workers cutting the forest, building fences and producing charcoal actively hunt animals in the remaining forest patches (Altrichter 2006; unpubl.) . Accordingly, large mammals tend to disappear from forest strips and smaller forest patches soon after the surrounding areas are deforested (N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Regueiro et al. 2015 , Semper-Pascual et al. 2019 . Furthermore, in areas already converted to agriculture, ranchers and farmers often persecute carnivores and herbivores thought to cause livestock or crop losses, respectively (Quiroga et al. 2016 , Camino et al. 2018 . While synergistic effects have been described through non-spatial methods in other deforestation frontiers (Peres 2001 ), here we provide an approach to map out the individual and combined effect of threats, and thus to track synergistic effects that may be common in deforestation frontiers around the world over time.",

These areas are excellent candidate regions for expanding the existing protected area network and our analyses can serve to update previous prioritization exercises (TNC et al. 2005 , Nori et al. 2016 .

In hotspots of habitat destruction, potential actions include 1) stopping further agricultural expansion and enforcing existing regulations, 2) securing Indigenous People's rights to land, 3) promoting culturally acceptable livelihoods that encourage sustainable land use and 4) fostering forest recovery. In hotspots of hunting pressure, specific actions include 1) careful planning of new roads and other land changes that foster access for hunters; 2) educational programs and improved management to lower or avoid conflicts with wildlife; 3) enforcing bans on recreational and commercial hunting and 4) ensure the sustainability of Indigenous People subsistence hunting. Several of these recommendations are in agreement with different Indigenous and smallholders visions in the Bolivian and Argentinean Chaco (Noss and Cuellar 2001, Camino et al. 2016) . Where both threats co-occur, they must be managed simultaneously. Implementing such complementary management actions is more likely to produce conservation gains than addressing single threats alone (Wilson et al. 2007) .",

Our study is also the first to reconstruct changes in multiple threats over long time periods, by combining satellite-based land-cover change maps with longitudinal datasets of road networks and over 27 000 subsistence ranches. Still, our work contains some limitations. First, although we gathered the largest occurrence dataset ever collected for the larger mammal community of the Chaco, presence points were scarce for some species in some regions, particularly the northern and southern Chaco for the 1980s. Second, our maps depend on thresholds for classifying threat levels, and we applied common criteria to define them. Still, other thresholds would change our maps. Finally, we used the human population density layers for 2000 also for 1985, because a comparable dataset for 1985 was missing. Although human population has likely not changed markedly in 1985-2000, we may have underestimated changes in hunting pressure for this period. This highlights the importance of long-term human population timeseries to transfer approaches such as ours to other regions (Lloyd et al. 2017) .",

Applying this approach to the 1.1 million km 2 Gran Chaco, a global deforestation hotspot, we find that the footprints of habitat destruction, hunting pressure and the areas where they synergize, are rapidly expanding. Such trends are likely common across other deforestation frontiers in Latin America, Africa and south-east Asia and our approach should therefore be broadly applicable to assess the geographies of threat in these regions. Our approach also allows to identify the remaining priority areas for biodiversity and to pinpoint to where threat-specific conservation actions to halt biodiversity declines should be implemented. Overall, our study highlights the importance of understanding and addressing the combined effects of major threats to biodiversity in order to better tackle biodiversity loss.",
