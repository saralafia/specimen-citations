For example, the generalist's flexible diet is cited to help explain recent range expansions, but no study has directly examined this claim. Here, we use stable isotope values of the Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana), a true generalist, to examine an extension of MacArthur's habitat heterogeneity hypothesis for a single generalist species. If a generalist's diet reflects local food abundance, then more heterogeneous landscapes should result in broader niches. We used stable isotope analysis, landcover indices, and WorldClim data to further evaluate how the opossum's use of its environment varies across ancestral regions, expansion fronts, and regions of human-facilitated introductions. Niche breadth varied across its range, especially between expansion fronts. We found a positive relationship between landcover diversity and isotopic niche breadth. World-Clim variables linked to aridity and C 4 plant abundance were most strongly associated with nitrogen (d 15 N) and carbon (d 13 C) values, respectively. Our results reveal that a generalist's stable isotope signature reflects its local environment, demonstrating their flexible diet is captured with stable isotopes and supporting the generalist habitat heterogeneity hypothesis.",

In 1917, the boundaries of an individual species' range were credited to physiological limitations to the environment (Grinnell 1917) , and a few years later, Elton defined a species' niche as its biotic position with predator and prey (Elton 1927 ). To better quantify a species' niche, Hutchinson proposed an n-dimensional hypervolume where the dimensions are the environmental conditions and resources that define a niche (Hutchinson 1957 ). This method of drawing niches informed the development of analyzing the isotopic niche (Bearhop et al. 2004) , typically depicted as an area drawn from two stable isotope ratios that inform a population's environment and diet. Isotopic niches have been leveraged to examine ecological concepts including the niche variation hypothesis and resource breadth hypothesis (Maldonado et al. 2017 , Rader et al. 2017 .",

Because of their broad diet, generalists can occupy numerous trophic levels within a food web, often making it difficult to predict their impacts on a community or how climate change will impact their populations (Prugh et al. 2009) . The literature examining how diet varies across a generalist's geographic range is limited. One study evaluating a generalist species across its range found that variation in diet was often linked to local food abundance (Terraube and Arroyo 2011), while a second study found dietary variation was constricted in highlatitude winters (Soe et al. 2017) .",

The R script to plot landcover can be found in Data S1. Landcover type for each opossum sample was extracted using its field collection coordinates. The 153 samples were collected from a total of 11 different landcover types (Appendix S1; Appendix S2: Fig. S1 ). The heterogeneity of the six regions was evaluated using four habitat diversity measurements: Simpson's diversity and evenness indexes and Shannon's diversity and evenness indexes. In our application of Simpson's and Shannon's equations, landcover types were treated as analogous to different species (Lausch and Herzog 2002 ; Appendix S2: Fig. S1 ).

GLMs were designed in IBM SPSS version 26.0 with a normal response for the d 15 N dataset and a gamma response for a positively adjusted d 13 C dataset. Single covariate models were run for each WorldClim variable, and WorldClim variables that were not correlated were also used to build two-covariate and threecovariate models (all variance inflation factors \u2264 1.020).

                "text": "WorldClim variables are averaged measurements from 1970 to 2000, and these data are approximate climate variables, especially for opossums collected outside of the 30-yr World-Clim window. The explanatory power of climate variation was low (<20%) for both isotopes in CF analysis, and parameter estimates from the topperforming GLMs were significant but subtle. This may in part be due to sampling from across multiple climatic regimes in North America which could amplify the noise of isotopic signals caused by local ecosystem processes and ecophysiological differences between plant species (Lajtha and Marshall 1994, Pardo and Nadelhoffer 2010) . This may also be due to the strong influence that human land-use (e.g., urbanization and agriculture) has on mammal communities, especially generalists (Rowe and Terry 2014) . The isotopic composition of a consumer is a combination of an animal's foraging behavior and the isoscape in which they are foraging (Yeakel et al. 2016) , so it is reasonable for climate not to explain all the variance detected in a relatively nomadic generalist species (Gardner and Sunquist 2003) . As a type A generalist (Gardner and Sunquist 2003, Bearhop et al. 2004) , the opossum's isotopic signature may offer a method to assess the isoscape of broad geographic areas. Our results demonstrate that their d 13 C and d 15 N values are impacted by both the local climate and landcover type. However, because the isotopic values of basal resources vary across space and time (Lajtha and Marshall 1994 , Pardo and Nadelhoffer 2010 , Yeakel et al. 2016 , our dataset cannot be used to directly compare the opossums' diets. To resolve this, primary consumers collected from the same site and year should be analyzed to serve as isotopic baselines to correct each opossum's d 13 C and d 15 N values (e.g., Olsson et al. 2009) .",

This difference may be due to the comparative homogeneity of the habitat and climate in the Northeast (Table 1) . In addition to encompassing all habitats found in the Northeast, the Midwest included both herbaceous and shrub covers (Appendix S2: Fig. S1 ). The more heterogeneous habitats in the Midwest (Table 1) that include herbaceous and shrub cover may include a greater variety of C 3 :C 4 plant ratios, resulting in a broader distribution of d 13 C values measured in Midwestern opossums. Similarly, the range of annual precipitation in the Midwest is greater (592 mm range) than in the Northeast (362 mm range). This larger range of precipitation may drive greater variation in d 15 N values in the Midwest. The contrasting isotopic results from the opossum range expansions in the Midwest and Northeast highlight the importance of understanding how local habitat and climate influence the ecology of generalist and mesopredator range expansions.",
