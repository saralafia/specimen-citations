Waltzing in Peromuscus maniculaiushas previously been observed by Sumner (1932, p. 9) , who found the character in a cross between albino (P.m. gambelii) and pallid (P.m. rubidus x sonorieneisi mutants, but the evidence for the inheritance of the character was \"not very strong.\" . The waltzing behavior of these mice is very similar to that of the wellknown domestic waltzing mouse, which belongs to the genus Mus and to a different family of rodents than Peromuscus. When properly stimulated the waltzing Peromyscus tend to run in close circles, often so rapidly that they seem to be rotating on the legs on the inside of the circle. The same mouse may rotate either to the right or to the left. The whirling may be kept up for a half-minute or even more at a time. Frequently the affected mice will waltz in their cageswithout apparent external stimulation. Being placed in a strange \u2022 cage or jar, the jangling of keys, or a pinch on the tail will usually stimulate a mouse having the waltzing character to perform his circling motions.",

All the older eremicus seem entirely unresponsive to sounds. The artemisiae waltzers are much more sluggish and require more stimulation to be made to waltz than do the bairdii waltzers. This probably is correlated with the much greater nervousness and greater activity of all the bairdii, both normal and waltzers. However, when the artemisiae have been stimulated sufficiently to begin waltzing they may perform as vigorously as do the bairdii. Another important difference between these two subspecies of maniculatus is that the artemisiae waltzers seem to be unresponsive to sounds, except when quite young, while the bairdii waltzers of all ages respond to sounds.",

When a sharp sound is produced near a resting' Peromuscus it will nearly always slightly twitch its ears, and the mice respond to rather faint sounds. I have found that the click made by snapping together a pair of forceps will usually produce a response in normal mice. Perhaps a better method of producing a sound is to tap a bottle gently with a pair of forceps or other small piece of steel. The animals are very keen in their senses other than hearing and they respond by sight to movements of the hands of the observer; they detect very slight air currents; and they also notice vibrations of the cage. Therefore, the source of sound must be entirely out of sight of the animals, and be free of contact with the table or cage. I nearly always secure a response in normal Peromuscue by snapping a forceps or by striking a bottle held in the hand under the table, using care not to make any movements of the body which might cause a response by the animal.",

Nevertheless, I believe that some of the young waltzing eremicus can hear, though all of the older waltzing animals are wholly unresponsive to sounds. Some at least of the young waltzing artemisiae also respond to sounds, and apparently some individuals retain the ability to hear until they are several months of age, but all the older waltzing animals fail to respond to sounds. The bairdii waltzers on the other hand seem to be responsive to sounds throughout life, and I have been unable to find an animal over three weeks of age that fails to give the ear twitch when a sharp sound is produced. Of a pair of waltzing bairdii recently tested the female was It years old and themale 2 years. Both gave a definite ear twitch to the sound of a glass bottle struck lightly by a steel forceps. They however did not respond to the sound so vigorously as did young bairdii of non-waltzing stock.

Through the kindness of Dr. William L. Straus, Jr. of the Johns Hopkins Medical School, the writer had the opportunity to study the volar surfaces of the manus and pes of a preserved specimen of Tupaia lacernata lacernata (U. S. National Museum, no. 123989, c ). In view of the writer's interest in the comparat.ive study and phylogeny of epidermal ridges.Tie feels particularly fortunate to. record these features in a representative of a genus that many authorities consider the prototype of all higher placental mammals. Figure 1 , A, presents the volar aspect of the right manus of Tupaia lacernata lacernata. In addition to the thenar and hypothenar pads, the four typical mammalian interdigital pads are present. The hypothenar pad is the largest, and, similar to interdigital pads II, Ill, and IV, possesses the form of a low, irregular, three-sided pyramid. In these four pads the apices and rounded edges are covered with short, usually slightly curved, ridges placed transversely with respect to the direction of the edges. Considerable portions of the sides of the pads are devoid of ridges. However, were one to continue the ends of the 'transversely placed ridges across the bare areas there would result a pattern of concentrically arranged ridges covering the pad. The pattern would then simulate successive spherical waves with the center of disturbance situated in the apex of the pad. Thus the arrangement of the epidermal ridges on the pads considered may be said to satisfy the fundamental plan of the mammalian dermatoglyphic pattern system which desider-",
