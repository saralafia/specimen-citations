A deletion variane 0 of Sxra, termed Sxr\\ which lacks Hya, SDMA expression, Spy and some Zfy-2 sequences, makes positional cloning of these genes possible. We report here the isolation of a new testis-specific gene, Sby, mapping to the DNA deleted from the Sxrb region (the .:1Sxrb interval). Sby has extensive homology to the X-linked human ubiquitin-activating enzyme El (ref. 11) . The critical role of this enzyme in nuclear DNA replication 12 together with the testis-specific expression of Sby suggests Sby as a candidate for the spermatogenic gene Spy.",

Screening an adult testis complementary DNA library with p Y8 resulted in the isolation of pCR5, a 1.6-kb partial eDNA. This a XX XX b eDNA was mapped, using somatic cell hybrids, to the proximal portion of the mouse X chromosome (C. E. B. and P. Avner, unpublished results). The hybridization pattern of pCR5 to the zoo blots also revealed male-specific fragments and thus pCR5 represents the X homologue of a new Y gene and could be used to isolate exons rapidly from the cloned Sxr DNA. The contig DNA was, therefore, screened with pCR5 and homologous fragments were isolated and sequenced from two .:lSxrb loci, Zf2 and T5 and two Sxrb loci, B3 and ZfB. A comparison of these genomic Y sequences with the pCR5 eDNA sequence revealed regions of homology adjacent to regions lacking homology, probably representing exons and introns, respectively (Fig. 1 b) .",

Dots represent gaps introduced to maintain alignment The nucleotide sequences from which the Sby and Sbx amino-acid sequences were deduced have been deposited in the Genbank database accession numbers in the EMBL data library: Sbx, X62580; Sby, X62581. METHODS. The Sby eDNA poMJ3 was subcloned into the Smal and Sail sites of pBiuescript II and sequenced as described in the legend to Fig. 1 . Comparisons at the nucleotide and amino-acid level were done using the University of Wisconsin GCG sequence analysis software package 22 . only 95-98% identical to those from the B3, ZfB or Zf2 DNA. The Sbx eDNA, pCR5 is 1,603 nucleotides long with an ORF across nucleotides 3-1,359. Both cDNAs have poly(A) tails at their presumed 3' ends. They only share homology in the ORFs, where they are 83% identical at the nucleotide level and 85% identical and 92% similar (85192% idl sim) at the amino-acid level. Database searches revealed that Sbx and Sby are highly homologous with the human ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) 11 and the almost identical A1S9 human eDNA which complements defective DNA replication in the tsA I S9 mutant cell line 15 . At the amino-acid level, Sby is 84192% idlsim to the human E 1 I A 1 S9 and Sbx is 97 I 98% idl sim. Sby and Sbx a re also homologous with other cloned E1 genes from wheae 6 and yeast 17 (Fig. 3) . As A1S9 and human El are virtually identical, A1S9 is probably El and Sbx represents the mouse homologue of the E1 1 A1S9 gene. As A1S9 has been localized to Xpll.2-4 in the human 18 the mapping of an Sbx homologue to human Xpll.2 (Fig. 2b) is consistent with this interpretation.",

The loss of Spy function in the testis of XSxrbO mice has been similarly correlated with a reduced mitotic index in the Tl prospermatogonia and the differentiating A sper-matogonia7. Sby may thus encode a testis-specific Y chromosomal El enzyme acting to augment insufficient levels of Sbx expression in the spermatogonial stages of spermatogenesis. Alternatively, Sby could control a specific ubiquitin-dependent pathway in spermatogenesis. To define further its function it will be important to determine whether Sby has ubiquitinactivating properties and if it can complement the loss of function in mutant E1 cell lines. Its map position in the Sxrb deletion, its testis-specific expression, and its homology with the El enzyme are all consistent with Sby being Spy. Definitive proof of this, however, can only be obtained by reintroducing Sby into XSxrbO mice to see if it can complement the deleted Spy function . D",

Expression was studied using RT-PCR from total RNA from a variety of male and female tissues and XXSxr\u2022 testis. +,-,Presence or absence of reverse transcriptase during the first strand eDNA synthesis respectively. The sizes of fragments amplified are indicated in (kb) and the products amplified from genomic DNA are indicated with an asterisk. The RT-independent fragment amplified from the RNA samples by oMJ41/ 42 arises from DNA contamination. The lack of an RT-dependent product with the Sbx primers in female lung is probably due to degradation of the RNA in this sample as the same primers amplify a product in male lung. METHODS. Total RNA was prepared from tissues following the protocol in ref.25. The RNA was not DNase treated. RT-PCR was done essentially as for 3' RACE24   , except that after first strand synthesis a primer pair (25 pmol each) specific for either Sbx or Sby was added. The cycle parameters used were 95 oc (5 min); 72 \"C to add 1.25 units of Taq polymerase (Perkin-Elmer Cetus); 60 oc (30 s); 72 oc (90s); and then 95 oc (30 s); 60 oc (30 s); 72 oc (30 s) for 34 cycles followed by 72 \u2022c (15 min). The Sbx primers were oMJ41: 5'-TGTCCACACCCACTI ACT -3' and oMJ42: 5' -GCACTCTGCAACTCCTGG-3'. The Sby primers were oMJ13: 5'-CCTCCTAGTCCGTATGTC-3' and oMJ48: 5'-GACCCCAAGTICATGGAG-3'. The first strand reaction, containing 3-htg total RNA, was diluted to 1 ml and 0.5 (.1.1 used for the amplification. For the controls, 50 ng genomic DNA was amplified. Amplified products were electrophoresed on a 2% Nusieve agarose gel in 1 xTAE."
