Barton & Hewitt (1985 , 1989 argued that most hybrid zones are 'tension zones' (Key 1968) , i.e. clines maintained by a balance between dispersal and selection against hybrids. Tension zones can move according to differences in population density, rate of dispersal and \u2044 or direction of dispersal and are more likely to move as a result of changes in population structure than by asymmetric selection (Barton 1979; Barton & Hewitt 1985) . Tension zones can also be stationary owing to a reduction in dispersal or a decrease in population density in the zone resulting from environmental factors or lower fitness of hybrids (Hewitt 1975; Barton 1979 ; Barton & Hewitt 1985) . Barton (1979) predicted that tension zones are more likely to remain where they first formed than to move.",

However, the extent to which tension zones move is not well established, given the difficulties detecting hybrid zone movement (Buggs 2007) . The most reliable method of detecting hybrid zone movement is direct observation over time, but this requires long-term studies and \u2044 or fast-moving hybrid zones. Hybrid zone movement can also be inferred based on historical records and \u2044 or patterns of introgression, i.e. the spread of an allele from one taxon into the gene pool of the other, using molecular markers. For example, a moving zone will leave in its wake a tail of clines at unlinked neutral loci (Arntzen & Wallis 1991; Buggs 2007) . However, this pattern could also be interpreted as evidence for adaptive introgression of alleles at various loci away from a stationary hybrid zone (reviewed in Buggs 2007) . Thus, inferring hybrid zone movement based on patterns of gene flow, alone, can lead to uncertain conclusions about the nature and direction of introgression from one taxon to another.",

For example, LD is created when two genetically distinct populations first hybridize and it will decay over time as a result of recombination (Reich et al. 2001) . Assuming low mutation rates, a comparison of genome-wide measures of LD between adjacent diallelic SNPs across hybrid populations could provide evidence for the relative age of the hybrid populations sampled. If genome-wide LD increases asymmetrically across a hybrid zone, one can infer hybrid zone movement in the direction of the higher estimates. This information can then provide a context for understanding the evolutionary significance of introgression, e.g. whether it is adaptive.",

                "text": "House mice, Mus musculus musculus and Mus musculus domesticus (also referred to, in the literature, as Mus musculus and Mus domesticus), hybridize in a narrow zone of secondary contact that extends from Denmark to Bulgaria. Hybrid mice have also been recently discovered in Norway (Jones et al. 2010) . The history of initial contact is unknown. However, because house mice are commensal in nature, their population dynamics, including range expansions, are likely to be influenced by human migration patterns. For example, the establishment of M. m. domesticus in western Europe is attributed to the 1st millennium BC coincident with an increased maritime exchange between the eastern and western Mediterranean regions (Cucchi et al. 2005) . The first reliably dated occurrence of M. m. musculus in southeastern Europe is attributed to the 4th millennium BC (Cucchi et al. in press) . The hybrid zone is likely a tension zone with selection against hybrids because of genetic incompatibilities including hybrid male sterility (Forejt 1996; Storchov\u00e1 et al. 2004; Britton-Davidian et al. 2005; Vysko\u010dilov\u00e1 et al. 2005 Vysko\u010dilov\u00e1 et al. , 2009 Good et al. 2008a Good et al. ,b, 2010 Mihola et al. 2009) , hybrid female sterility (Britton-Davidian et al. 2005) and increased parasite loads of hybrids (Sage et al. 1986a; Moulia et al. 1993) , although a recent study has shown the opposite pattern (Baird et al., submitted) . The best studied incompatibility is hybrid male sterility, where complex epistatic interactions are involved in spermatogenic failure (Forejt 1996; Good et al. 2008a ). These include X-autosome interactions that result in asymmetric sterility in some reciprocal crosses (Britton-Davidian et al. 2005; Good et al. 2008a) , typically when the maternal line is Fig. 1 The location of the house mouse hybrid zone in Europe and the collecting localities for the two transects studied. The black line demarcates the hybrid zone, and the shaded rectangles indicate the location of the two transects (top map). Collecting localities for the Czech (CZ) transect and the southern Bavaria transect (BV) are denoted by numbers that are crossreferenced in Table S1 (Supporting information).",

One study (Teeter et al. 2010) compared two transects, one spanning a portion of the state of Bavaria in Germany and Austria (the BV transect, Fig. 1 ) and a second spanning portions of the states of Thuringia, Saxony-Anhalt and Saxony in Germany, and found different patterns of introgression for multiple autosomal markers. The authors concluded that the genetic basis of isolation may be dependent on local genetic or environmental effects. Another study (Bo\u017e\u00edkov\u00e1 et al. 2005) compared the BV transect with a transect located 200 km to the north spanning a portion of Bavaria, Germany and the Czech Republic (the CZ transect, Fig. 1 ). Asymmetric introgression of mitochondrial DNA from M. m. musculus to M. m. domesticus was noted in the CZ transect, but introgression of mitochondrial DNA from M. m. domesticus to M. m. musculus was found in the BV transect. A comparison of the nonrecombining portion of the Y chromosome between these same two transects (Tucker et al. 1992; Machol\u00e1n et al. 2008) suggests asymmetric introgression from M. m. musculus to M. m. domesticus in the CZ transect and no introgression in the BV transect.

We greatly expand on all previous studies of this hybrid zone (Tucker et al. 1992; Payseur et al. 2004; Bo\u017e\u00edkov\u00e1 et al. 2005; Machol\u00e1n et al. 2007 Machol\u00e1n et al. , 2008 Machol\u00e1n et al. , 2011 Teeter et al. 2008 Teeter et al. , 2010 Dufkov\u00e1 et al. 2011) by interrogating 1401 X-linked and autosomal SNPs, spaced approximately 2 Mb apart across the genome. This high-resolution genomic perspective allows us to study the detailed patterns of LD for the first time.",

A total of 437 mice were collected by Richard Sage in a roughly linear east-west manner from 41 localities in 1984, 1985 and 1992 . The CZ transect is 130 km long \u2022 50 km wide and extends from northeastern Bavaria, Germany, to western Bohemia, Czech Republic (Bo\u017e\u00edkov\u00e1 et al. 2005; Machol\u00e1n et al. 2007 Machol\u00e1n et al. , 2008 . A total of 895 mice were collected from 79 localities between 1991 and 2003, with >95.5% collected since 1997. To calculate the distances in CZ, Cartesian coordinates were projected onto a onedimensional axis parallel to the most likely direction of change in allele frequencies and ordered with increasing distance from the western-most locality (Dufkov\u00e1 et al. 2011) . Sampling in both transects involved setting traps in suitable areas or where mouse activity was evident, typically within dwellings. While sampling methods may have differed slightly between transects, they were consistent within a transect and are thus not likely to impact the observed trends within transects.",

The default setting, which incorporates the general model with varying recombination rate (Li & Stephens 2003) , and the -X10 option, which increases the final runs 10 times longer than the main iteration, were used. Predicted phases with best pair probabilities >0.80 were retained for each individual. The squared correlation of alleles at two sites, r 2 , was used to quantify linkage disequilibrium between adjacent markers separated by <2 Mb. It is less sensitive to allele frequency differences between loci and shows less inflation than D\u00a2 (Weir 1996) in small samples (Ardlie et al. 2002) . Gametic r 2 , the squared correlation of allelic indicators at two loci in a haploid gamete (Weir et al. 2004) , was calculated from autosomal (males and females) and X-linked (females only) loci. Because LD can be affected by sample size and allele frequency, r 2 was calculated from each locality using the same number (n = 10) of randomly chosen individuals collected in the same year and by removing alleles from each locality with a minor allele frequency \u00a30.05. SNPs with a proportion of missing data >0.5 within each locality were also removed. In addition, localities with n \u2021 10 but with <40 possible pairwise SNP comparisons were removed from the analysis. These included six localities, all from the edges of the hybrid zone in CZ. The resulting data set included eight localities in BV and 14 in CZ. For some localities, a sufficient number of individuals (n \u2021 10) were collected in multiple years, making it possible to generate r 2 estimates for different years from the same locality. In addition, for a subset of localities, a sufficient number of individuals were collected in a single year to estimate r 2 from a sample of n = 15, 19 and \u2044 or 20 mice.",

In BV, the mean \u2044 median cline width and centre for X-linked markers are 10.23 \u2044 5.87 km and 57.26 \u2044 56.22 km, respectively, and the mean \u2044 median cline width and centre for autosomal markers are 45.99 \u2044 24.03 km and 66.21 \u2044 61.05 km, respectively. In CZ, the mean \u2044 median cline width and centre for X-linked markers are 14.7 \u2044 11.79 km and 68.03 \u2044 68.36 km, respectively, and the mean \u2044 median cline width and centre for autosomal markers are 26.45 \u2044 21.03 and 67.29 \u2044 66.95, respectively. These estimates provide evidence for steep clines in accord with a tension zone model with selection against hybrids owing to genetic incompatibilities (Fig. S2, Supporting information) . The simple two-parameter model returns larger estimates of cline width than the six-parameter model (Machol\u00e1n et al. 2007; Teeter et al. 2010) and does not, in and of itself, capture asymmetry in cline shape. However, when cline width is plotted against cline centre for each SNP marker (Fig. 4) , asymmetry is revealed. In BV, cline centre shifts to the east as cline width increases for many markers. In CZ, a different pattern is found. Cline centre shifts in both directions as cline width increases. The two-parameter mean cline centres for the X-linked SNPs from BV and CZ are very similar to the mean cline centre of 55.10 km and 68.26, respectively, as calculated for 13 X-linked markers for the same transects analysed with the six-parameter model (Payseur et al. 2004; Dufkov\u00e1 et al. 2011) .",

First, a large number of markers (approximately 50%) show minimal deviations in cline centre. Because cline centre and cline width are correlated, these SNPs are in genome regions exhibiting narrow clines, on average, and therefore, they may be in, or closely linked to, regions associated with reproductive isolation. Second, many markers (>300) show a marked deviation in cline centre to the east in BV but little or no deviation from median cline centre in CZ. If the hybrid zone is moving from east to west in BV, we might predict these markers to be neutral. Third, a few markers show deviations in cline centre in the same direction, either from east to west or from west to east, in both transects. These markers may be in genome regions with genes that confer strong fitness advantages and, as such, escape barriers to gene flow, regardless of the direction of hybrid zone movement. Finally, excluding the large number of markers showing a marked deviation in cline centre to the east in BV, there are a few markers with deviations in cline centre that are transect specific. These markers may indicate regions with genes conferring fitness advantages on a local scale.",

LD, measured separately for samples collected in 1984 and 1985, showed similar patterns of decay for similar sam-ple sizes (n = 10, 15 or 25) between years and is slightly lower when sample size is increased by five or 10 individuals. Because mean and median gap size among SNPs for all chromosomes are approximately 1.8 Mb, we compared the r 2 values of all pairwise SNPs with a genomic distance \u00a32 Mb, as this measure includes most of the adjacent SNPs. For populations sampled across the BV transect, mean r 2 ranged from 0.2679 to 0.7093, with values generally increasing from east to west (Table 2) . For populations sampled across the CZ transect, mean r 2 ranged from 0.3471 to 0.8217, with values generally increasing from west to east.

When r 2 values are plotted against distance from mean cline centre, estimated using ClineFit, they are greatest in populations to the west of cline centre in the BV transect and to the east of cline centre in the CZ transect (Fig. 6) . Similarly, when r 2 values from these same populations are plotted against mean hybrid index per locality, they increase as the proportion of M. m. musculus alleles decrease across the BV transect and as the proportion of M. m. musculus increase across the CZ transect (Fig. 7a, b) . The distribution of populations from which we could measure values of r 2 , i.e. a sufficient number of SNPs with a minor allele frequency \u20210.05 allowing for >40 pairwise comparisons, differed between transects. In CZ, these populations included a region 17 km to the west and 13 km to the east of median cline centre, whereas in BV, these populations included a region 12 km to the west but over 90 km to the east of median cline centre. This difference reflects the pronounced asymmetry in cline shape in BV in comparison with CZ as demonstrated by the relationship between cline centre and width ( Fig. 4 ) and the asymmetrical distribution of clines centres relative to median cline centre (Fig. 6) .",

                "text": "Comparing measures of LD among 'neighbouring' SNPs across hybrid populations of house mice to assess evidence for hybrid zone movement is based on the idea that LD is highest when two genetically distinct populations first hybridize and then decays over time as a result of recombination (Reich et al. 2001) . Our measures of LD between adjacent diagnostic SNPs across two transects in the house mouse hybrid zone sampled at different points in time provide a snapshot documenting the history of the sampled populations. They suggest hybrid zone movement as manifested in several trends in the data. Values of r 2 and haplotype block size (half-length of LD) measured from populations sampled in 1984, 1985 and again in 1992 across the BV transect change in a unidirectional mode across geographic distance, from east to west and across hybrid index from Mus musculus musculus to Mus musculus domesticus, a pattern consistent with hybrid zone movement from east to west over time. The highest values of r 2 do not coincide with mean cline centre calculated for autosomes or for X-linked markers, as might be expected in a stationary zone (Barton & Hewitt 1985) . Values of r 2 and haplotype block size measured from populations sampled more recently, from 1999 to 2007, across the CZ transect, change across geographic distance from west to east and across hybrid index from M. m. domesticus to M. m. musculus, although these trends are not as pronounced as in BV. The range of values of r 2 is lower in CZ than in BV and the lowest values of r 2 in CZ are higher than the lowest values in BV, suggesting less stability in CZ populations and possibly past movement in both directions. However, the highest values of r 2 are east of the cline centre suggesting more recent movement from west to east. Simulations indicate that under certain conditions, particularly when geography or selection halted the spread of hybrid chromosomes in one direction but not the other, a moving hybrid zone may produce aspects of the LD patterns observed in the BV and CZ transects. Unique aspects of the empirical data, however, suggest that fur-ther study using different models is warranted to more fully understand the evolutionary forces behind potential hybrid zone movement. Age estimates provide some information on the relative stability of mouse populations. Some populations sampled later in time are, in fact, estimated to be younger than populations sampled earlier in time. Consistent with findings from other studies of population size (e.g. Dallas et al. 1998; Hauffe et al. 2000) , these data suggest that house mouse populations are likely to consist of small demes that are subject to extinction-(re)colonization events. The older age estimates for populations on the eastern side of the BV transect suggest that these populations are more stable than populations on the western side of the BV transect. Raufaste et al. (2005) combined cline theory and migration rates to calculate initial contact between M. m. musculus and M. m. domesticus in central Jutland between 700 and 1800 years ago, an estimate consistent with archaeological data (Cucchi et al. 2005) . Estimates of age across the BV and CZ transects are much younger, suggesting the possibility that age of initial contact is not easily captured from the estimates of LD when populations are unstable. Nevertheless, the estimates of LD using SNPs diagnostic for M. m. musculus and M. m. domesticus provide information on relative recency of mixing of the two genomes. The clear pattern of increase in the values of r 2 across geographic distance, from east to west in BV, suggests that mixing has occurred more recently in the west in this transect.",

                "text": "Asymmetries in cline shape have been provided as evidence for hybrid zone movement in a number of hybrid zones in nature (reviewed in Buggs 2007) . However, asymmetry is viewed as equivocal evidence for movement because it could also explain adaptive introgression away from a stationary front (Dasmahapatra et al. 2002) . The shift in cline centre, either to the east or to the west, as cline width increases (Fig. 4) , is suggestive of asymmetrical introgression in the house mouse hybrid zone. Across the BV transect, asymmetry is especially pronounced and previous studies have interpreted this pattern as a possible example of adaptive introgression of M. m. domesticus alleles away from a stationary front (e.g. Teeter et al. 2008) . However, coupled with evidence for increased LD from east to west, we now suggest that M. m. domesticus alleles are lagging behind a westward moving front and, as such, they may represent 'neutral' footprints of this movement. It is interesting to note that several markers in BV show a shift in cline centre to the west. Given the direction of hybrid zone movement, these markers may be in genomic regions where M. m. musculus alleles are conferring fitness advantages in hybrid mice. For CZ, asymmetrical introgression is not as pronounced as in BV and occurs in both directions depending on the SNP marker. This may be a signature of movement in both directions as suggested by the pattern of LD discussed earlier or evidence for adaptive introgressions. In a previous study, Machol\u00e1n et al. (2011) found evidence for X-linked introgression in both directions. However, these authors found qualitative differences between the east-and west-introgressing markers. The westintrogressing markers were geographically localized and displayed significant linkage disequilibria. The east-introgressing loci formed isolated and mutually independent islands of M. m. domesticus alleles on a M. m. musculus background. This pattern was interpreted as being a result of westward zone movement leaving some alleles behind as footprints of this movement (Machol\u00e1n et al. 2011) .",

                "text": "Of the 23 cases of possible hybrid zone movement reviewed by Buggs (2007) , selection was proposed as the mechanism responsible for the pattern in all instances. These, as well as more recent studies (Chatfield et al. 2010) , suggest, in particular, that mating asymmetries and responses to environmental changes (Garc\u00eda-Par\u00eds et al. 2003; Leach\u00e9 & Cole 2007 ) may be selective explanations for hybrid zone movement. In house mice, behaviour of both males and females is thought to play a role in reproductive isolation (Vo\u0161lajerov\u00e1 and asymmetric behavioural selection has been proposed as a possible explanation for hybrid zone movement (Raufaste et al. 2005; Teeter et al. 2008 and , although it is difficult to imagine how these could result in differences in hybrid zone movement between transects. Asymmetric sterility because of genetic incompatibilities between the X chromosome and autosomes in some reciprocal crosses (Storchov\u00e1 et al. 2004; Britton-Davidian et al. 2005; Good et al. 2008a,b ) might also play a role. In this case, the differences in the direction of hybrid zone movement may result from known instances of polymorphism of hybrid sterility alleles (Forejt and Ivanyi, 1975; Britton-Davidian et al. 2005; Good et al. 2008b; Vysko\u010dilov\u00e1 et al. 2009) . Alternatively, differences in hybrid zone movement between transects may result from selective effects associated with responses to the local (extrinsic) environment. However, because our simulations are equivocal regarding the role of selection vs. geography-dependent dispersal in hybrid zone movement, it is also possible that dispersal asymmetry is the result of human-mediated transportation of mice and land-use change. This possibility was suggested as an explanation for clinal patterns in the Danish hybrid zone transect (Raufaste et al. 2005) . Alongside selection, it could also account for the remarkable differences between the CZ and BV transects. Continued sampling over time of the same populations in CZ and BV may help determine the role of selection vs. geography in hybrid zone movement. If selection is responsible for the observed patterns, one might expect to see continued evidence of movement over time. If, however, movement is geography dependent, one might expect that changes in the landscape may alter or even halt movement.",
