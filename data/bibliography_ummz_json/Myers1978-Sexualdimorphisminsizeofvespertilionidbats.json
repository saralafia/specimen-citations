                "text": "Sexual dimorphism in birds and mammals is a phenomenon that has provoked intense interest. Two explanations (not mutually exclusive) are most commonly given for selection favoring dimorphism. The first, put forth by Charles Darwin, is based on the competition of one sex for the other and the different selective pressures resulting on the competitor and the object of competition (Darwin 1859; see Trivers 1972 and Ralls 1976 for reviews). Trivers argues that the sex contributing most to parental care will be in short supply and hence will be the object of competition. Thus, in most mammalian species, males compete for females. Large size is often advantageous in intraspecific competition, so males tend to be larger than females when competition occurs. The second explanation of sexual dimorphism is that differences between males and females are a means of reducing intraspecific competition for resources, especially food (Amadon 1959; Selander 1966; Storer 1966; Schoener 1967; Earhart and Johnson 1970) .",

Flight places strict limitations on the size and proportional relationships of different parts of the body; coefficients of variation for wing measurements of bats are lower than those for limb measurements of terrestrial mammals (Long 1968 ). Bats have further undergone a reduction in the size of the extreme anterior and posterior parts of the body, resulting in the reduction of weight and the concentration of mass in the pectoral region. Yet, despite the apparent importance of size, female bats are capable of carrying large young. Near-term embryos commonly weigh 20%-30% of the female's body weight after birth (table 1) . This is a considerable load, and its effect on flight is increased because it is located well posterior to the point of attachment of the wings. Furthermore, females may carry their newborn young to new roosting sites if disturbed after parturition (Davis 1970 ).",

Body size is determined by a compromise between many requirements. In the case of male bats, feeding and roosting habits are probably paramount. For females these same factors are important, but in addition an increase in body size reduces the proportionate load of the fetus or newborn young. Wing size may increase even more, resulting in a reduction of wing loading (grams carried per square centimeter of wing area). In a similar manner, the relative cost of producing milk (measured, for example, as calories per gram female weight) is reduced when females are larger. Further, lactating females consume more food than males (Kunz 1974a) . Large size may permit females to carry a larger quantity of insects in their stomachs. Thus, Amer. Natur. 1978 .

Forearm length was chosen as the primary variable, however, because it is consistently dimorphic, easily measured, and frequently included in systematic studies. It was the only variable measured in some cases. In order to test the second prediction, an estimate of general body size is also necessary. Weight could not be used because it is often unavailable, and its use would require differential treatment of specimens according to reproductive status and time of year. Total body length was also rejected because its inclusion would require reliance on the often idiosyncratic original measurements of many different collectors. Instead, I used the greatest length of the skull, measured from the posterior border of the supraoccipital to the anterior end of the premaxillae. This requires the assumption that growth of the head region is linearly related to total growth, which is often, but not always, true (Gould 1975) . Considering the limited number of measurements that can be taken from a skin and skull, however, skull length is probably the best measure of body size available in this case.",

In comparisons of species that differ greatly in wing size it is necessary to consider general size when analyzing this difference since, for example, a 5-mm difference between sexes in a species with an average forearm length of 30 mm may be much more important than an equal difference in a species with an average length of 100 mm. Accommodation of species of different sizes is usually accomplished by using ratios or, when the variables are used in correlation analyses (as below), by partialling the correlation on average forearm length. This results in the removal of any relationship between the size of the forearm and the absolute difference between female and male sizes. The use of partial correlations, however, or the substitution of ratios for the absolute difference, had little effect on the correlations reported below. Therefore, the phrase \"degree of dimorphism\" will henceforth refer to the difference between average female and male forearm length.",

Both total weight of the neonatal bats and weight proportional to female weight after birth differ significantly between bats bearing one young and those bearing two young. Thus, the weight carried by a female just before birth is probably greater for species bearing more young per pregnancy. Unfortunately, no data were available for species bearing more than two young. Females carry nurselings, at least when disturbed (Davis 1970) , and the sum of the weights of the several young at the age just before they first fly probably represents a larger proportion of the mother's weight than in species bearing a single young (e.g., Grinnell 1918; Johnson 1932; Poole 1936; Bailey 1937; Stegeman 1955; Packard 1956; Stains 1965; Golley 1966 ). Finally, if there is no relationship between number of young and weight borne by the female, no correlation between dimorphism and number of young would be expected. That is, a decrease in the size of each young accompanying an increase in litter size should obscure (rather than augment) a correlation between litter size and degree of dimorphism.",

Few data are available but Saccopteryx bilineata, S. leptura, and Rhynchonycteris naso, three Central American species of bats of the family Emballonuridae, fit that description and are dimorphic with females slightly larger than males(Bradbury and Emmons 1974). Similarly, Nycteris hispida (Nycteridae) are dimorphic with females larger, as are female Hipposideros cyclops, H. abae, and H. caffer centralis (Rhinolophidae)(Verschuren 1957), and several members of the family Phyllostomatidae (seeRalls 1976).SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONSSexual dimorphism in body size of mammals is usually explained in terms of competition among members of one sex for members of the other or as a means of reducing intraspecific competition for resources such as food. Sexual dimorphism in vespertilionid bats, often characterized by females exceeding males in body size, does not seem to fit either explanation. A third hypothesis, that female body size is influenced by the need to fly with and nourish large fetuses (and occasionally young), is probably unique to bats. If true, it should follow that the greatest degree of sexual dimorphism would occur in those species bearing the greatest fetal or neonatal weight. Examination of data concerning size (skull and forearm lengths) and reproduction for vespertilionid bats reveals that the total weight and modal number of young born per pregnancy per species are strongly, positively correlated with the degree of sexual dimorphism in wing size. Further, covariance analysis shows that the wings of females of several species of vespertilionids are larger than those of males even after statistical adjustment of the data to make the body size of each sex the same. These observations suggest that sexual dimorphism in size of vespertilionid bats is influenced by the demands of large fetuses.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS I thank Richard D. Alexander, Michael D.
