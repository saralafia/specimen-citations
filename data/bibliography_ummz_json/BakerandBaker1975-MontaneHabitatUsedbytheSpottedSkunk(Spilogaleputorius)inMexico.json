Consequently, the following information seems worth recording.",

Field parties from the Museum at Michigan State University have visited this Mexican locality in the four summers (July) of 1971 to 1974 for the purpose of studying mammalian populations. It was unexpected after so much previous trapping that in the fourth summer (of 1974) the first records of the spotted skunk (S. p. leltcoparia Merriam) for the area would be obtained. Although Tomahawk live-traps (size 13 by 13 by 41 centimeters) were baited with canned fish for as long as ten consecutive nights at intervals along all sides of Playa Azul, the four males captured were taken in a restricted area on the northeast-facing slope. On close inspec_ tion, we found that these spotted skunks were using at least three dens in the broken rubble just below the upper edge of the rimrock bordering the top of the mesa. The talus covered only the first 20 meters of this steep slope ( see Fig. 1 ), with the mixed pine-oak fore.;.t on Playa Azul above and a sparse growth of pine, oak, madrono, and manzan ita on the grassy slopes below. Piles of fecal material, attributed to the spotted skunks, \\vere collected in front of the three den openings. Insects fann ed the bulk of the food materials in the 25 scats (some broken ) examined. Food items and their percent freq ue ncies in the droppings included the followi ng : Scarabaeidae (both larvae and adults in 100 percent ); Lucanidae (both larvae and adults in 100 percent) ; Silphidae (adults in 4 percent) ; Lepidoptera ( larvae in 20 pen:ent, pupae in 4 percent); centipede ( in 4 percent ); unidentified lizards (in 12 percent ); unidentified seeds ( in 8 percent ). Other terrestrial vertebratcs captured in this area of rimrock were Scelopon~ poinsetti, AII()1is maculosa, Crotalus lepiclus, Peromyscus boytii, and NeotOflUJ mexicana. T he four skunks ( belonging to a species previously unreported from Durango, Baker and Creer, 1962; 138) were deodorized, caged and tran.<;ported alive (with one exception) back to the MSU Museum Live Animal Colony for furth er study.",

                "text": "A wide variety of mammalian species have developed sacular extensions of the oral cavity in conjunction with various types of foraging behaviors. These buccal or cheek pouches serve in mo~t cases as temporary storage reservoirs, allowing their owners to gather a large amount of food in a relatively short length of time. The pouch is thus a stmcture which adapts its possessor to rapid exploitation of a mobile or scarce food source or to rapid gathering of food items in a potentially dangerous area. Several species of bats have been reported to possess cheek pouches. Because no detailed descriptions of the morphology and function of these structures exist we think that a presentation of this infonnation will be of interest.Cheek pouehes have been reported in at least three species of bats. The pouches in Noctilio Ieporinus were first noted in 1847 (Gosse, Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., 20:424, 1847) and mentioned by several more recent authors; those of Molossus ater were described by Goodwin and Greenhall as being large and present in both sexes (Goodwin and Greenhall, Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat. Rist., 122; 187-302. 1961); the presumed nectar and pollen-feeding megachiropteran Plerotes ancheilae is reported to have cheek pouches (Walker, Mammals of the World, Johns Hopkins Univ. Press, p. 218, 1968) . We dissected two specimens each of Noctilio leporinus and Molossus ater. A single specimpn of Noctilio Iabialis was also dissected, and on the possibility that pouch development and fishing habits are correlated we also included a single specimen of M !lotis (PizoIlYx) vivesi. Specimens of Plerotes ,vere not available for dissection. The identifications of the facial muscles are presumed homologies based on position, because embryological and neurological homologization of the musculature could not be accomplished at the time.The structure of the cheek pouches in both species of Noctilio is essentially identicaL In Noctilio the pouches are formed from posterolateral expansions of the buccinator muscle. The resulting sacculation lies over the buccal side of the mandible, occupying thc posterior one-third of the horizontal ramus. The cheek pouches extend caudally to",
