Comparative phylogeography (e.g., Bermingham & Avise, 1986) developed as a modern manifestation of this interest and was the focus of a recent colloquium (Avise, Bowen, & Ayala, 2016 ) that addressed the current limitations, and future prospects of the discipline. Several papers that emerged from that colloquium issued a call for the development of trait-based approaches for phylogeography to move forward (e.g., Papadopoulou & Knowles, 2016; Riddle, 2016; Zamudio, Bell, & Mason, 2016) , echoing earlier studies that integrated traits into phylogeography (e.g., Paz, Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez, Lips, & Crawford, 2015) .",

(2016) used a machine learning framework to predict whether or not unsampled species were likely to harbour cryptic diversity, which was defined originally as pre-Pleistocene divergence across a geographic barrier. Since the Esp\u00edndola et al. (2016) Pacific Northwest training data set included two woody plants, a mammal, three amphibians, and two terrestrial invertebrates, life history traits that could be coded across all included species were difficult to identify. To address this shortcoming, taxonomic categories served as a proxy for life history traits and were used with occurrence records for species endemic to a particular region or ecosystem as observations to be classified. Predictive accuracy was reasonably good in Esp\u00edndola et al. (2016) and the predictive phylogeographic framework remains ideally suited to incorporation of trait data as predictor variables, particularly for comparative phylogeographic investigations that are more taxonomically focused.",

The broad taxonomic sampling of such studies leads to inherent difficulties related to the comparison of genetic variation, but model selection and species-specific simulations represent powerful tools to test ecosystem-wide hypotheses (e.g., Carstens et al., 2005; Carstens & Richards, 2007) and make species-specific predictions (e.g., Ruffley et al., 2018; Smith, Ruffley, Tank, Sullivan, & Carstens, 2017) , enabling such cross-kingdom comparisons. Along with simulations and model comparison, the use of the predictive approach provides an invaluable strategy for the integration of trait data into comparative phylogeography because such data are often available even in taxa for which no genetic data have yet been collected.",

The challenge in doing so for a taxonomically broad comparative data set is to identify traits that may influence the geographic structure of genetic variation and are available and scorable across plants and animals. Traits that we integrate here include aspects of diet, life stage at dispersal, mode of dispersal, presence or absence of selfing, reproductive output, and maximum body size. Including these variables improves the predictive ability of the RF predictor and, more importantly, allows us to make inferences regarding the association of functional traits with geographic patterns of genetic variation, thereby demonstrating the applicability of machine learning in biodiversity studies.",

Two thirds of observations are randomly assigned to be used as input data to construct decision trees; the remaining third is called the out-of-bag (OoB) sample and is used as an internal validation to assess accuracy of the emergent classifier. At each split (i.e., node) in each decision tree, a random subset of the predictor variables is chosen. From among this set of variables, the one that best partitions the observations between classes is selected. This process is repeated and nodes are added to decision trees until all observations are classified (step 2C, Table 1 ). Whereas individual decision trees may provide poor predictions (i.e., high OoB error rates), the ensemble classifier obtained from a collection (i.e., a forest) of random trees has been shown to be very accurate in many applications. Furthermore, the proportion of decision trees in the forest that classify an observation into a particular category (i.e., the proportion that classify an occurrence record as being from a taxon that harbours cryptic diversity) provides a measure of strength of inference. For more information, an excellent review of random forest classification is provided by Liaw and Wiener (2002) .",

The PNW supports the world's greatest extent of temperate coniferous rainforests (Franklin & Dyrness, 1973) , and this ecosystem occurs in two distinct bands: one along the Coast and Cascades Ranges and a disjunct inland segment in the northern Rocky Mountains of Idaho, Montana, and British Columbia (e.g., DellaSala et al., 2011 ; see figure 1a in Esp\u00edndola et al., 2016) .

Compile a reference data set where the response variable has been assessed (e.g., presence or absence of a deep phylogeographic split) (a) Investigate phylogeographic patterns for several codistributed taxa using molecular data and classify each taxon according to a response variable. In this case, whether or not reference taxa are determined to harbour cryptic diversity is the response variable, as evaluated based on the presence/absence of a pre-Pleistocene phylogeographic break. Sequence/genomic data may be generated de novo or mined from existing databases (i.e., Genbank). We use phylogeographic model selection to assess the response variable, in a comparative phylogeographic approach (b) Compile occurrence records for all taxa in reference data from public databases (e.g., GBIF, Arctos, etc.), field work, and/or publications. These represent the observations that we wish to classify with respect to the response variable (i.e., as belonging to a taxon that harbours or lacks cryptic diversity) (c) For each observation (occurrence record), we obtain and tabulate climate data (e.g., from WorldClim), taxonomic data, and trait data. These are the predictor variables 2. Apply random forest (following Breiman, 2001; Liaw & Wiener, 2002) to build a predictive model (i.e., classifier) (a) Randomly select 2/3 of the observations to train the model. This is the in-bag sample (b) The remaining random 1/3 of the observations are the OoB sample to be used for internal validation (i.e., used to calculate OoB error rates) (c) Build a random decision tree to classify the training set (i) From a random subset of predictor variables, select the best predictor variable (i.e., the predictor variable that most effectively splits observations into classes). Classify the training data based on the selected variable. This represents the first node in the decision tree (ii) Grow the decision tree by adding predictor variables at random (i.e., new nodes in decision tree) until all observations in the training set are classified correctly (d) Repeat steps 2a-2c many times to create a forest of random decision trees (e) Classify each OoB sample using the forest of decision trees. This classifies an OoB observation, whose state is known (i.e., from a taxon that has or lacks cryptic diversity) allowing an assessment of OoB error. In addition, the frequency of inference (across the forest of decision trees) for each OoB observation provides an assessment of strength of that inference that have yet to be assessed the species Melozone fuscus (formerly Pipilo fuscus) because, as currently defined, it does not include populations in Baja California.

Our approach, along with the regression model approach introduced by Paz et al., (2015) , provides phylogeographers with a framework to integrate ecology and life history into the maturing discipline of comparative phylogeography (e.g., Papadopoulou & Knowles, 2016; Riddle, 2016; Zamudio et al., 2016) . Our predictive framework has the potential to expand the importance and impact of comparative phylogeography and its relevance to other disciplines because it enables researchers to use existing databases to make predictions about the structure of genetic variation that may be present in taxa before genetic data are collected. In the two systems examined here, the use of cross validation, where n \u2212 1 taxa are used to build the random forest classifier (where n is the number of taxa in the reference data set), demonstrates the power of the approach to make predictions about a taxon that was not used in building the classifier (Figures 1 and 2) . Furthermore, in using a collection of random decision trees to classify a test observation (in this case an occurrence record), the ensemble approach provides some measure of strength of the prediction in the congruence of the prediction across the forest of decision trees.",

As a result, the suite of traits that we examined differed. In the PNW system, the most important traits to include were reproductive mode (selfing vs. outcrossing) and trophic level, with less importance identified for dispersal stage, maximum size, and dispersion mode (Figure 3) . The ability to self has long been thought to relate to dispersal ability (Baker's Law; Baker, 1955) and may play an important role in the recolonization of previously glaciated habitat, which is thought to have occurred in PNW rainforest endemics following the Pleistocene glacial cycles (e.g., Carstens et al., 2014) . In the taxa studied here, all taxa capable of selfing lacked cryptic diversity and were inferred to have been recent dispersers to the inland rainforests. However, in general, predictions made by Esp\u00edndola et al. (2016) By contrast, in the SWAL system, we identified a single trait, clutch size (Figure 4) , as the most important trait (as measured by MDA).

                "text": "The identification of factors that influence patterns of biodiversity has been a long-standing goal of biogeography. In addition to distribution and diversity gradients, attention has focused on traits that influence genetic diversity within species, including life history traits in plants (e.g., Loveless & Hamrick, 1984) and propagule size animals (e.g., Romiguier et al., 2014) . It has become increasingly clear that trait data, whether from existing databases or collected from natural populations, allow phylogeographers to integrate their work with other disciplines in the biological sciences (Zamudio et al., 2016) , and a recent call has been made for phylogeographers to integrate traits into phylogeography in a more meaningful way. However, some authors have been using traits as a priori predictors of pattern for several years. For example, Alvarez et al. (2009) found that the ecological spe- consisting of combinations of traits that could be compared with a linear regression. In these examples, the authors asked if traits were associated with a particular phylogeographic pattern, either a single trait (Papadopoulou & Knowles, 2015) or several (Alvarez et al., 2009; Paz et al., 2015) . However, both of these approaches are limited in the number of traits they can examine. In the approach of Papadopoulou and Knowles (2015), the number of traits that could be considered was limited due to the use of the hierarchical ABC framework to test the prediction of codivergence across a geographic barrier. In Alvarez et al. (2009) , the number of traits analyzed was so small that they could apply standard statistical approaches. Paz et al. (2015) investigated a larger set of traits by selecting a set of 28 generalized linear models to compare via multi-model inference techniques. However, these models represent only a small subset of the possible models, which may be a limitation in comparisons across broad taxonomic groups where researchers' intuitions may be misleading and cause important trait variables to be missed. By allowing for the incorporation of a potentially large number of trait variables into phylogeographic studies, machine-learning approaches such as the one used here offer a solution to this problem. They also dramatically expand the scope of comparative phylogeography because it is no longer limited to codistributed taxa.",

They did this by testing for isolation by distance and environment within each species and building a set of predictor variables that include organismal trait data related to metabolism along with other variables measuring aspects of the species range, habitat, and taxonomy. More detailed organismal trait data can be incorporated by limiting the taxon sampling. For example, Carstens, Morales, Field, and Pelletier (2018) investigated >300 species of bats to identify organismal traits associated with demographic responses to end Pleistocene climate change. Notably, since each of these supervised machine-learning approaches utilize data from public databases such as gbif, worldclim, and genbank, the continued growth and refinement of these databases will expand the scope of predictive phylogeography.",

We achieved good (in the SWAL system) to excellent (in the PNW) performance with respect to prediction accuracies. In particular, incorporation of trait data improved the accuracies produced by Esp\u00edndola et al., (2016) , where only taxonomy and climatic data were used, especially for the taxonomically restricted SWAL test data set. Alternatively, one could use such approaches to test the effect of traits that have hypothesized a priori to impinge on the geographic structure of genetic variation (e.g., Alvarez et al., 2009; Paz et al., 2015) .",

For the classifier built with a curated set of traits, a curated set of taxa, and taxonomy, prediction accuracies were nearly 100%, and for the classifier built with a curated set of taxa, no traits, and taxonomy, prediction accuracies were 100%.In the cross-validation analyses based on the curated set of taxa, curated trait data, and taxonomy, all taxa were classified correctly (Figure 1, red densities). To explore how replacing or supplementing taxonomy with trait data affected prediction accuracy, we compared the classifications from this classifier with those from the classifier that included only taxonomy and bioclimatic variables(Figure 1, blue densities) and with those from the classifier that included curated taxa, curated trait data, but no taxonomy(Figure 1, yellow densities) to explore how replacing or supplementing taxonomy with trait data affected prediction accuracy.For all species except Haplotrema vancouverense, accuracy did not change substantially. For H. vancouverense, prediction accuracy decreased when trait data were used, and decreased further when trait data were used without taxonomy. For this species, taxonomy contains information useful for predictions that is not captured by climatic variables or the traits that we used, and the trait data are misleading when analyzed in the absence of taxonomy. Likewise, for Microtus richardsoni, the inclusion of trait data decreases prediction accuracy, but not to the same extent as was observed for H. vanouverense.",

For Toxosotma cinereum/T. bindirei, the classifier with taxonomy (plus climatic data) incorrectly predicts a lack of cryptic diversity, whereas inclusion of trait data in the classifiers results in correct prediction of cryptic diversity(Figure 2). For Auriparus flaviceps, the correct prediction of absence of cryptic diversity is only attainable with all three data types (climatic, taxonomic, and trait data)included. For Polioptila melanura/P. californica, the classifier with trait data led to an incorrect classification, but with taxonomy included, the presence of cryptic diversity is predicted accurately. Finally, for one complex (Ammospermophilus leucurus), predictions tended to be inaccurate regardless of whether or not trait data were used(Figure 2).",
