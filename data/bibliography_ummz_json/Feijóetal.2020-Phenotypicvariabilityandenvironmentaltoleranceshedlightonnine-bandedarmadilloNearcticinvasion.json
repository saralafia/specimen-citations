The morphological differences exhibited by invader armadillos can be related to their reduced reliance on myrmecophagy, with armadillos from temperate open areas in North America exploiting a broader range of dietary items. Moreover, we found the climatic conditions faced by alien armadillos during the initial phases of their Nearctic invasion fell within the native climatic range. In sum, high phenotypic variability and substantial environmental tolerance in the nine-banded armadillo help to explain its nearly ubiquitous distribution across contrasting ecosystems in its native range as well as its successful Nearctic invasion. Our findings underscore the importance of studying the covariation of morphology and climate across native and invasive ranges to understand biological responses in novel environments.",

To be a successful invader, alien species must overcome various hurdles from dispersal through establishment. Many introductions fail due to the organism's inability to survive, reproduce, and reach a minimum population size or to spread across exotic ecosystems (Jeschke and Strayer 2005; Sol 2007; Blackburn et al. 2011 ). To predict the success of biological invasions, modern theoretical frameworks highlight the importance of an integrative understanding of the invaders' life-history traits, founding population structure, environmental constraints, and biotic interactions (Blackburn et al. 2011; Kleunen et al. 2010; Gurevitch et al. 2011; Forsman 2014; Capellini et al.2015) .",

                "text": "Surviving the initial establishment stage requires rapid, effective ecological and behavioral responses to novelty, as species will often succumb before they can evolve new traits to exploit an exotic environment. In this sense, generalists are more prone to become successful invaders than specialists due to their inherent ability to exploit diverse resources (V\u00e1zquez 2006; Sol 2007) . This hypothesis is supported mainly by natural history characteristics (Jeschke and Strayer 2006; Sol 2007; Forsman 2014; Capellini et al. 2015) , while the importance of morphological traits on successful invasion has been poorly explored. However, phenotypic diversity in founder groups clearly enhances the successful colonization of exotic habitat (Davidson et al. 2011) . For example, in a metaanalysis of experimental studies, Forsman (2014) found a strong positive correlation between phenotypic variability and the establishment success of plant and animals. Nevertheless, regardless of the focal traits, evaluating the environmental responses of species throughout their native range is a prerequisite to understand how introduced populations have responded to a novel habitat (Bossdorf et al. 2005; Hierro et al. 2005) . Building a comparative framework between native and invasive population traits and their ecological interactions is key to assess whether phenotypic alterations might be linked to the species successful invasion. Unlike many North American and Eurasian mammals (Jeschke and Strayer 2005) , few Neotropical mammals have become invasive. The nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus Linnaeus, 1758) is one of the few extant South American mammals to successfully invade the Nearctic. This species currently has a remarkably broad distribution spanning an area of 19,100,000 km 2 from Argentina to the United States (Taulman and Robbins 2014; Feij\u00f3 et al. 2018) . Historically, D. novemcinctus reached its northern range limits at the south bank of the lower Rio Grande, on the border between Mexico and the United States (Strecker 1926; Taber 1939) . Since the mid 1800s, following their human-mediated introduction into Texas, the range limits of this species have rapidly shifted northward. Over four recent decades, the northern range limit has shifted at least 450 km, from Oklahoma to Nebraska (Humphrey 1974; Taulman and Robbins 2014) . Such impressive and continuing northward range expansion marks the nine-banded armadillo as a highly successful immigrant.",

However, no study has evaluated the role of morphological features in its impressive Nearctic colonization. To address this question, we explore phenotypic traits via geometric morphometric techniques between nine-banded armadillos from native and invasive ranges and relate them to environmental climate factors. We chose skull morphology (size and shape) as a surrogate for overall morphological diversity because the skull is associated with the main sensory systems mediating environmental perception and also reflects changes in the dietary and ecological interactions across populations (Monteiro et al. 1999; Jiang et al. 2002; Schoch 2006; Nogueira et al. 2009; Klaczko et al. 2016; Feij\u00f3 et al. 2019a) . One might therefore expect that the different environmental pressures posed by contrasting or novel Nearctic biomes/environments will exert strong influences on phenotypic transformations of armadillo skulls. Under this scenario, skulls of armadillos from the invasive range will show greater similarities to each other than to those in its native range, reflecting an uneven response to distinct selective pressures. To test this hypothesis and to understand the main abiotic forces that have shaped the phenotypic variation of this Panamerican species, we undertook an extensive analysis at a hemispheric scale, including the entire native range of the nine-banded armadillo. Our primary goal was to assess whether the phenotype (size and shape of the skull) of alien armadillos show novel phenotypic responses to the climatic niches they incounter in invasive range.",

The identification of the specimens was based on diagnostic external, carapace, and cranial traits (see Feij\u00f3 et al. 2018 for a detailed explanation). In addition, we added to that dataset, 498 records of D. novemcinctus from the Nearctic region obtained from North American museums available through the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (gbif) database (https://doi.org/10.15468/dl.n7lsxk accessed on 4 June 2019). Because D. novemcinctus is the only extant species of armadillo in the United States, misidentifications involving these records are highly unlikely. The final dataset included 1944 museum specimen records collected from 1820 to 2015; it represents 906 unique localities lying between the latitudes 34\u00b0S and 40\u00b0N, including 502 localities from its native range and 404 from its invasive range (Fig. 1b ).",

The resulting phenotypic dataset included idealized skulls representing 148 different localities scattered across the nine-banded armadillo's native range (from Uruguay to Mexico) and eight localities from its newly invaded range. The covariation of environmental variables with the shape and size of the skull was evaluated using Two-block partial least squares analysis (Two-BPLS). The advantage of this method is that it can be used with multicollinear variables, which is common among environmental variables (Rohlf and Corti 2000) . In each analysis, 10,000 simulations were run to assess the significance of the correlation. Finally, we carried out Procrustes ANOVA using the climatic and spatial (latitude and longitude) variables together as functions of size (centroid size) and shape variation (Procrustes coordinates) of the skull. The significance of these analyses was obtained from permutation procedures with 1000 randomizations. The dimensionality of the environment variables was reduced through principal component analysis. We retained the first three principal components based on Horns parallel analysis criteria (Peres-Neto et al. 2005) . Together the three components accounted for 81.4% of the variation among the climatic variables; the first PC (PCenv1) is mainly related to temperature in the coldest season, PCenv2 to temperature in the warmest season, and PCenv3 is mainly associated with precipitation (Online Resource 4).",

First, we tested if armadillos inhabiting the Nearctic region can be statistically differentiated from those from the Neotropical region using Procrustes ANOVA in the geomorph package. At a fine-scale, we investigated whether armadillos inhabiting invasive biomes are more similar to each other than to individuals in native biomes. The delimitation of biomes was based on Olson et al. (2001) and combines biotic (e.g. vegetation distribution) and abiotic (e.g. climate, relief, geologic historic events) attributes. Six biomes were present within the range ( Fig. 1a ): Deserts and Xeric Shrublands (hereafter DXS, sample size = 21); Tropical and Subtropical Dry Broadleaf Forest (DBF, sample size = 31); Tropical and Subtropical Grasslands, Savannas, and Shrublands (GSS, sample size = 77); Tropical and Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests (MBF, sample size = 127); Temperate Coniferous Forests (TCF, sample size = 5), Temperate Grasslands, Savannas, and Shrublands (TGS, sample size = 5). The first four biomes are within the nine-banded armadillo's native range, and TCF and TGS are included in its exotic range. We explored the skull shape variation via principal component analysis (PCA) to assess the breadth of morphospace spanned by armadillos in each biome. We then carried out Procrustes ANOVA followed up by pairwise comparisons to test the significance of skull differences between pairs of biomes while accounting for allometry. Pairwise comparisons were performed using the pairwise function implemented in geomorph and were based on two metrics: the mean shape and the morphological variance. The first computes least squares comparisons of the skull shape mean and the second compares the morphological disparities (i.e., within-group variantion) between groups. The significance of these analyses was obtained from permutation procedures with 1000 randomizations. Finally, to assess whether armadillos from newly invaded areas resemble each other more than they do animals from the native range, we built a Neighbourjoining tree based on Mahalanobis distance of skull shape per biome.",

On the other hand, differences in mean size was only significant between DBF-GSS and GSS-MBF biome pairs, whereas there were significant differences in size variation between DBF-GSS, DBF-MBF, and DBF-TGS biomes (Online Resource 7).

Our findings show that D. novemcinctus exhibits pronounced morphological variation, and its size and skull shape variation follow distinct geographic patterns between native and alien armadillos. High intraspecific diversity reflects the capacity of a species to exploit a wider array of natural resources, directly increasing its niche breadth, resource acquisition, and reducing intra-specific competition. These attributes should also speed recovery from habitat perturbations, adaptation to novel environments, and population size fluctuations, ultimately reducing its vulnerability to extinction (Bolnick et al. 2011 ; Wennersten and Forsman 2012; Gonz\u00e1lez-Su\u00e1rez and Revilla 2013; Forsman 2014). The remarkable variability exhibited by the nine-banded armadillo may explain its presence in strongly contrasting spatial and environmental habitats throughout its hemispheric distribution. Moreover, we show that the climatic conditions faced by armadillos in alien biomes encountered early in its Nearctic invasion (in the southern of the United States) fell within the native climatic envelope of the species. Together, these two factors help to explain the nine-banded armadillo's successful invasion of temperate areas in United States. (Fig. 4) . Intrapopulational variability suggests relaxed selection pressures, in which contrasting phenotypes co-occur due to weakened selection concerning size (Lahti et al. 2009; Alvarado-Serrano et al. 2013) . A similar phenomenon characterizes another generalist tropical mammal, the grass mouse Akodon mollis, whose morphological variation is weakly structured spatially in association with its broad tolerance of climatic variables (Alvarado-Serrano et al. 2013).",

D. novemcinctus does not follow Bergmann's Rule, the tendency for body size to increase at higher latitudes (Graves 1991; Meiri and Dayan 2003) . This is not surprising since this ecogeographic prediction was coined to describe trends in Nearctic and Palaearctic homeotherms, and does not apply to all species (Meiri and Dayan 2003; Rodr\u00edguez et al. 2006 Rodr\u00edguez et al. , 2008 . Instead, the Resource Rule proposed by McNab (2010), which predicts size change in response to the abundance and availability of resources, better fits our findings. The largest individuals are present in rainforest areas (e.g. Amazon and Atlantic Forests), whereas in open formations (e.g. Cerrado) individuals tend to be smaller. We hypothesized that highly seasonal tropical habitats support small-to-medium-sized individuals due to food limitation-these animals are large enough to store sufficient fat reserves to survive the season of scarcity but have low overall energetic demands. On the other hand, less seasonal habitats, which offer year-round access to food, can support larger animals with greater energy demands; this accords with the largest specimens of D. novemcinctus being found in the Amazonian and Atlantic Forest regions.",

This result is quite surprising considering the marked climatic and vegetation differences faced by D. novemcinctus across its Panamerican range. Considering skull shape as a proxy of dietary adaptations (Nogueira et al. 2009; Klaczko et al. 2016) , we hypothesize that armadillos have a similar diet across its native range. The few available dietary studies in Central and South America support this explaination by showing that ants and termites are the most consumed itens both in open and forested biomes (Redford 1986) .

Individuals from the highly seasonal Nearctic Region are large (Fig. 4) . One possible cause for this heterogeneous response is energetic balance and starvation time. Dasypus novemcinctus is a tropical species that has only recently invaded temperate zones. It lacks the hairiness and physiological adaptations that other temperate-zone armadillos possess (D. pilosus and Chaetophractus at high elevations and Zaedyus at high latitudes). The success and geographical extent of the D. novemcinctus invasion depend on the ability of animals to survive cold winters when food availability is drastically reduced (Taber 1945) . In a comprehensive study of metabolic rates of armadillos, McNab (1980) showed that the latency to starvation is extended by increased body mass and associated larger fat deposits. Therefore, larger individuals can survive longer periods of starvation than smaller ones. Thus, a tradeoff between fat reserves and energy requirements may be the key physiological tradeoff for the nine-banded armadillo living in temperate zones. In this sense, variation in size seems to respond to an intricate balance of niche exploitation, physiological constraints, and environmental pressures, whose relative importance changes through the species' range. This multifactorial hypothesis also explains the low performance of our statistical models in predicting size throughout the distribution of D. novemcinctus: rather than a unique fixed set of factors, a dynamic and variable interaction between abiotic and biotic variables is required to describe size variation in nine-banded armadillos.",

Temperate invaders exhibit wider rostrums and less rounded braincases than those in the tropics (Fig. 5b) ; these characteristics are broadly involved in the biomechanics of mastication (Smith and Redford 1990; Reiss 2000) . Narrowing of the rostrum, smoothness of the braincase, and simplification of cranial masticatory muscle attachments are features related to myrmecophagous (ant-eating) mammals (Smith and Redford 1990; Reiss 2000) . This suggests that the skull shape of armadillos from native tropical areas reflects their greater reliance on ants and termites than armadillos in temperate open areas. Our hypothesis is corroborated by dietary studies that show ants and termites dominate the diet of nine-banded armadillos from South America (Redford 1986; Anacleto 2007) , whereas invading animals from North America consume a broader range of items, leading some authors to treat it as omnivorous (Sherman 1943; Redford 1986; Sikes et al. 1990) . We can speculate that this morphological response to the amount and availability of food resources enhances survival in a harsh alien ecosystem and has contributed to their successful colonization of the United States.",

The inherent high phenotypic variability of the nine-banded armadillo may be seen as a key component of its successful Nearctic colonization, particularly in the initial establishment stage, as shown in previous studies (Forsman 2014; Davidson et al. 2011) . In addition, the environmental conditions initially faced by nine-banded armadillos in the southern United States (Texas, Louisiana, Georgia, and Florida) are similar to the climate encountered in its native range (Fig. 3a) . Soon after the first report of a nine-banded armadillo in the United States in 1850s, numerous papers mentioned the remarkable abundance of the species in several localities of Texas and its rapid northern and eastern expansion (Bailey 1905; Strecker 1926) . As Loughry et al. (2013) noted, survival and reproduction are the most important parameters to predict armadillo population growth. Thereby, its initial success in colonizing novel environments were seemingly tied to the high environmental tolerance and phenotypic variability that allowed the nine-banded armadillo to consume whatever food resources were available, and thus to survive and reproduce. Another important factor in its initial expansion would include the absence of close competitors (see below). In contrast, its life-history attributes (e.g. high longevity, produce of four siblings, delayed implantation, behavior plasticity) are probably more important as the population begins to stabilize and disperse to new areas. These now include regions well outside of its native climatic envelope (e.g. the states of Illinois, Missouri, Colorado, Kansas, and Oklahoma).",

Its continued rapid northward expansion in the United States after its first appearance in the mid 1800s (Audubon and Bachman 1854) has been apparent for over a century, inspiring hypotheses concerning controls on its northern range limits. Climatic factors supposedly impose ecological limits to the northward expansion of the species (Newman 1913; Taber 1945; Humphrey 1974; Taulman and Robbins 2014) . Areas with average daily January temperatures of -8\u00b0C (around 40\u00b0N) and about 500 mm of annual precipitation appear to be thresholds (Taulman and Robbins 2014) . These numbers are corroborated by the range of climatic variables extracted from 1944 museum specimens (Table 1, Fig. 2 , Online Source 5 and 6) and agree with the ecological niche modeling estimates of Feng and Papes (2015) . Our results, however, suggest that colder temperatures are more limiting than lower precipitation (see Figs. 2, 3b ; Online Resource 5 and 6). The climatic constraint impose by aridity seems a secondary consequence of insect scarcity rather than a direct effect of drought (Taber 1945) .",

This hemispheric asymmetry may be attributable to the absence of other armadillo competitors in North America and their presence in the Southern Cone. Dasypus novemcinctus is the only living species of armadillo that occurs north of Mexico (Wetzel 1985) . In contrast, thirteen species are present in Argentina, three of which (Chaetophractus villosus, Chaetophractus vellerosus and Zaedyus pichiy) reach their northern limits near the southern limits of D. novemcinctus (Wetzel et al. 2008) . All three species belong to the Euphractinae, which have the broadest diets among armadillos (McDonough and Loughry 2008) . Their omnivorous diets are an apparent response to cold, dry environments where soil-dwelling insects become seasonally scarce (McDonough and Loughry 2008) . Dasypus species are considered generalist insectivores (Redford 1985; McDonough and Loughry 2008; Loughry and McDonough 2013) , feeding mainly on hymenopterans, isopterans, and coleopterans, together with occasional vertebrates and plants (McDonough and Loughry 2008) . In addition to their dietary adaptations, C. vellerosus and Z. pichiy both have lower basal rates and higher minimal conductances than D. novemcinctus, suggesting that these species are better adapted to temperate zones (Roig 1971; McNab 1980) . Indeed, the pichi is the only armadillo known to hibernate during the winter season (Superina and Boily 2007) . Thus, both energetic demands to survive stressful weather and competition with cold-tolerant specialists for limited resources apparently constrain the southward expansion of D. novemcinctus.",

The remarkable phenotypic variation and high environmental tolerance of D. novemcinctus help to explain its presence across contrasting ecosystems and, together with the absence of other armadillos in North America, the success of its ongoing expansion into the Nearctic Region. Skull traits of Nearctic nine-banded armadillos depart from the pattern within its Neotropical native range. Size in alien armadillos seems to reflect a trade-off between fat reserves and energy requirements to survive cold, foodless winters. Shape variation can be related to dietary breadth-armadillos from temperate open areas in North America are more omnivorous than tropical forms, which are more reliant on myrmecophagy. Our findings underscore the importance of characterizing the morphology and climatic features of native populations to understand the biological responses of invasive species in exotic environments. This topic is still largely neglected in studies of biological invasions.",
