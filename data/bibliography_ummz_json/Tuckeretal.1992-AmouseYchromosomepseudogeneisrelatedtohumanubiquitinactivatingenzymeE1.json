Muller (1914) theorized that the Y Chr of Drosophila diverged from the X Chr as a result of two processes: crossover suppression between the ancestral pair of sex chromosomes, and the subsequent loss of gene function on the Y Chr. One prediction of Muller's hypothesis is that the non-recombining portion of the Y Chr should contain few functional loci. A second is that the Y Chr should have residual loci in the non-recombining region that are homologous to loci on the X Chr. These Offprint requests to: P.K. Tucker loci would reflect the ancestral homology between the X and Y Chrs.",

The Sxr region on the Y Chr is a non-recombining region that contains both the testis determining locus, Tdy, and the H-Y transplantation antigen, Hya (reviewed in Eicher and Washburn 1986); it is located on the short arm of the Y Chr (McLaren etal. 1988; Roberts el al. 1988 )~ We report that pYS/b contains part of a pseudogene related to the human ubiquitin activating enzyme El. We provide evidence from amplification experiments that pY8/b-related sequences are located on the Y Chr in the inbred mouse strain C57BL/6J, and we discuss the relevance of these findings to the evolution of mammalian sex chromosomes.",

Nine amplification experiments were conducted, one with each primer pair at each of three annealing temperatures (50~ 48~ and 38~ Three samples were included in each experimenl: a 1.5 ixg sample of female C57BL/ 6J genomic DNA, a 1,5 ~g sample of male C57BL/6J genomic DNA, and a blank to which no DNA was added. We used 5 M of each 10 ~M primer in each 1130 ~1 reaction. The concentrations of Taq DNA polymerase, reaction buffer, and deoxynucleoside triphosphates per 100 ixl reaction were as recommended by Ferkin-Elmer Cetus. The amplification protocol was as follows: 25-35 cycles, with denaturation at 95~ for 1 rain, annealing at 50~ 48~C, or 38~ for 1 min, and elongation at 72~C for l mix 15 s, PCR products were separated by size on a 3% Nusieve gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized under UV light. To control for possible contamination of our template DNA, these experiments were repeated using two additional female and two additional male samples of C57BL/6J genomic DNA.",

This finding is consistent with the recent discovery of a functional gene related to pY8/b on the Y Chr in the mouse (Mitchell et al. 1991) . It is doubtful, however, that the functional equivalent of pY8/b on the Y Chr is the mouse E1 gene. Ubiquitin activating enzyme E1 is a regulatory molecule that catalyzes the activation of ubiquitin. Ubiquitin has been isolated from a variety of eukaryotic organisms, and from a wide variety of tissues (reviewed in Wilkinson 1988) . One would expect that E1 would also be found in a wide variety of mammalian tissues, and indeed, Northern blot analysis has shown that El is present in several human tissues as a single transcript approximately 3.5 kb in length (Handley et al. 1991) . In contrast, the functional equivalent of pY8/b on the Y Chr appears to be expressed in a tissue-specific manner, that is, when pY8/b was used as a hybridization probe to poly(A) + RNA from adult male mouse liver and testis, it iden-tified a testis-specific transcript approximately 3.5 kb in length (Bishop et al. 1987) . This tissue specificity suggests that the Y-specific functional equivalent of pY8/b is not the mouse E1 gene. Rather, it may be a member of a family of El-like regulatory genes.",

However, Mitchell and co-workers (1991) identified a ubiquitously expressed gene on the X Chr which they hypothesize to be the mouse E1 gene. If pY8/b is related to the purported mouse E1 gene on the X Chr, one would expect to amplify a pY8/b-related sequence in both females and males. Our failure to detect this gene using PCR can be explained in the following way. Most of the primers used in our experiments were constructed from introns, which are evolutionarily less conserved than exons. It is probable, therefore, that our primers were designed from a region of the pseudogene that is not conserved in the functional E1 gene on the X Chr.",

Because recombination is absent between such loci, they are effectively non-allelic genes, and divergence at both the nucleotide and amino acid level resulting in functional differences is expected. Studies of the zinc finger genes in mouse have determined that Zfx and Zfy-1/Zfy-2 are 70% identical at the amino acid level and differ markedly in timing and specificity of expression (Mardon et al. 1990; Nagamine et al. 1990) . In contrast, studies of the zinc finger genes in human have determined that ZFX and ZFY are on average 92% identical at the amino acid level and both genes are ubiquitously expressed (Schneider-Gadicke et al. 1989; Lau and Chan 1989; Palmer et al. 1990 ). The ribosomal protein genes, RPS4X and RPS4Y, located on the human X and Y Chrs are 93% identical at the amino acid level (Fisher et al. 1990 ).

PCR products were separated by size on a 3% Nuseive gel and stained with ethidium bromide. Female (9) and male (4') genomic DNA was used in each experiment as well as a blank to control for contamination. The size standard (S) is HaelII digested phiX 174 RF DNA. Top panel: (a) Amplification of the malespecific target size fragment, 376 bp in length, and an additional male-specific fragment, 410 bp in length, from C57BL/6J using an annealing temperature of 48~ and primers spanning nucleotides 9-385. Identical results are obtained at annealing temperatures of 38~ and 50~ (b) Amplification of the target size 310 bp fragment and an additional 350 bp fragment in male C57BL/6J, and four fragments, approximately 1500 bp, 1100 bp, 285 bp and 315 bp in length in female C57BL/6J using an annealing temperature of 38~ and primers spanning nucleotides 1640-1950. The presence of female-specific fragments can be explained by hypothesizing that, in the absence of a good match with female template DNA, the primers annealed to other, less well matched genomic sequences unrelated to pY8fo. This is further supported by the fact that the female-specific fragments did not amplify at annealing temperatures of 48~ and 50~ (not shown in figure) . (e) Amplification of the target size 284 bp male-specific fragment, an additional 320 bp male-specific fragment, and two fragments shared between male and female, 1300 bp and 1000 bp in length using an annealing temperature of 48~ and primers spanning nucleotides 1746-2030. Identical results are obtained at 38~ and 50~ Bottom panel: Corresponding Southern blot hybridized with pY8/b under high stringency conditions. No femalespecific fragments or fragments shared between males and females hybridized with pY8/b under low or high stringency conditions. selection in males and females. With the evolution of crossover suppression between the ancestral X and Y Chrs, alleles fixed on the Y Chr would become independently evolving loci that code for male-specific characters. If Zfy, RPS4 Y, and the El-related locus on the Y evolved from the ancestral mammalian X and Y, then they should function in a male-specific manner. A direct test of this prediction will come from two kinds of studies: phylogenetic studies to determine whether these loci were members of the ancestral mammalian X and Y Chrs, and functional studies of these genes at the protein level. The zinc finger genes on the sex chromosomes are the first for which there are data of this kind. Although these genes are present on the sex chromosomes in a variety of eutherian orders (Page et al. 1987) , they are not present on the sex chromosomes in metatherians (Sinclair et al. 1988 ), suggesting that they were not part of the ancestral mammalian X and Y Chrs (assuming a single origin for the mammalian XY pair). In addition, the zinc finger genes on the X and Y Chrs in humans are highly similar and ubiquitously expressed, indicating that the zinc finger gene on the Y may not necessarily function in a male-specific manner (Schneider-Gadicke et al. 1989; Palmer et al. 1990) . Together, these data do not violate the prediction that Y-linked loci will function differently than their residual homologs on the X Chr, because ZFY may not have been part of the ancestral mammalian Y Chr. However, the testis-specific expression of Zfy-1 and Zfy-2 in adult mice (Nagamine et al. 1990) suggests that these genes function in a male-specific manner in some species. If the male-specific function of Zfy-1 and Zfy-2 in the mouse evolved subsequent to the translocation of the zinc finger genes onto the mammalian X and Y Chrs, as the phylogenetic data indicate, then the malespecific function of Zfy-1/Zfy-2 in the mouse cannot be explained by Charlesworth's hypothesis. Rather, a different explanation is needed for the male-specific expression of Zfy-I/Zfy-2 in the mouse. Additional research on the expression of the zinc finger genes across a variety of mammalian taxa should clarify whether differential function of these genes, as seen in the mouse, is indeed an evolutionarily derived trait. More generally, these kinds of studies, investigating the history and function of residually homologous loci from the X and Y Chrs, should significantly further our understanding of sex chromosome evolution.",
