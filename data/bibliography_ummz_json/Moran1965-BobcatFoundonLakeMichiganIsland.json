    "abstract": "GENERAL NOTES 645 791, 1942). P' is absent, and the molars definitely resemble those of Napaeozapus rather than of Zapus. The tail is complete and lacks the white dorsal tip, except for a white terminal tuft, but the pelage of the body has the orange tint characteristic of Napaeozaptls. The original identification of this specimen as Napaeozapus is confirmed. In a study of an additional 222 specimens of Napaeozapus from the United States and Canada was found one individual, UMMZ 84450, from Menominee County, Michigan, in which a minute P' is present on the left side, but not on the right. On the basis of pattern of reentrant folds in the molars and characters of the pelage, this specimen is referred to Napaeozapus insignis. As rare variations, then P' may be absent in Zapus and present in Napaeozapus. I am indebted to W. H. Burt for suggesting this study and for reading the manuscript.",

There is no record of this species for the Beaver Island group except for the \"uncertain\" report of Hatt et al. (Island life: a study of the land vertebrates of the islands of eastern Lake Michigan. Cranbrook Inst. Sci. Bull., Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, 1948, 179 pp.) . This was based on a Beaver Island resident's recollection of a skin from a Big Beaver Island animal. The authors considered the bobcat as apparently absent, but a good prospect for representation and possibly missed in their surveys. They did not, however, visit Garden Island.",

With the exception of the work of Hatt et al. (op. cit.) and more recent ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbellus) research activities by the Michigan Conservation Department's Game Division, little attention has been given to animal populations of the islands. Active winter travelers such as the red fox (Vulpes fulva) and snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus) have long been resident on the islands, while the coyote (Canis latrans) has more recently wandered over from the mainland. Ice usually bridges the Upper Peninsula mainland (north shore of Lake Michigan) with the Beaver Islands intermittently each winter. It is probable that this bobcat represents a wandering individual. However, it is not impossible that a small population exists on one or more of these remote islands. All of the islands offer suitable habitat for bobcats: abundant small mammals include the snowshoe hare, eastern chipmunk (Tamias striatus) and woodland deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus).-RICHARD J.
