Most of the mechanisms suggested for their origins are simplistic-usually a single factor, ranging from extreme food deprivation to isolation of antediluvian species. To my knowledge, no one has described adequately either the pattern of variation of mammals on islands, or synthesized the many suggested causes (Van Valen, 1973) . This paper is an initial attempt to redress this deficiency. It is not intended as a thorough review; rather, it presents significant new data, briefly summarizes trends in body size of mammals, and presents a causal model of body size evolution in insular mammals. It is possible that the processes and patterns discussed here apply to other animals but I have directed my studies to mammals alone. Each topic discussed below is worthy of a lengthy review, and it is my hope that this paper will stimulate additional research and discussion.",

This observation stimulated a more detailed study of size variation in these squirrels and led to the present paper. Body size of C. prevosti is discussed at the beginning of the paper, because variation in this species provided insight into the evolution of body size of insular mammals and formed the basis of my hypotheses and models.",

Most populations have a black dorsum and tail, a broad white lateral stripe, and a red venter; many have a prominent shoulder patch which may be black, gray, red, white, or a mixture of these. In Selangor, Malaysia, tri-colored squirrels nested in trees and fed on coconut and rubber seeds, and oil palm fruit (Harrison and Traub, 1950; Harrison, 1962) . Davis (1962) stated that in Sabah, North Borneo, they were found in primary and old logged forest where they inhabited chiefly the smaller trees of the middle story. Stomach contents consisted of pulpy fruit and about 5% insect matter, chiefly ants and termites. Three pregnant females taken on 20 June, 24 June, and 2 August had two, two, and three embryos, respectively. At Bukit Lanjong, West Malaysia, they have been seen feeding on the fruit of fig trees (Ficus) in the upper story (MacKinnon and Mac-Kinnon, 1974:36) . Nothing definite is known of the predators or competitors of these squirrels.",

I examined all specimens in the main collections of the National Museum of Natural History, Washington, D.C.; measurements of most of these specimens have been published previously in a series of papers by Lyon (1906 Lyon ( , 1907 Lyon ( , 1908 Lyon ( 1911 and Miller (1900 Miller ( , 1901 Miller ( 1903 Miller ( ' 1906a Miller ( , , , 1906b . For some subspecies no measurements have been published and no specimens could be located. Length of head and body was used as an indicator of overall size, because it is recorded on the field labels of nearly all museum specimens and because it is not subject to the variations caused by loss of tail vertebrae, as is total length, or to daily and seasonal variations in weight. Visual inspection of the measurements suggests that most were rounded to the nearest half centimeter, introducing a small amount of variability. Additionally, some specimens were originally measured to the nearest quarter inch; all such measurements were converted to the nearest millimeter for analyses. Only adults, defined as animals with permanent teeth erupted and partially worn, were used in statistical analyses. No significant dimorphism in size between sexes was found so , sexes were combined for analyses. Because no complete listing of Malaysian islands and their areas was available, most of the data in Table 1 were compiled by locating islands on U.S. Army topographic maps ( 1: 250,000 series). Areas were estimated by placing a sheet of trans-~a rent, gridded (2.5 mm X 2.5 mm) plastic over the map and counting the number of grid squares covering an island. The error in estimating island areas was small and unbiased. Depth of surrounding water was estimated from depth recorded on the same U.S. Army maps and also from U.S. Navy hydrographic maps.",

The maximal extent of sea lowering was about 200 m, in the mid-Pleistocene (Jongsma, 1970) . Van Andel et al. (1967) estimated that sea level in the neighboring Arafura Shelf was about 120 m lower than at present during the late Pleistocene (ca. 20,000 BP). During the periods of low sea level, terrestrial vertebrates, including C. preuosti, could have reached the sites of present islands by overland dispersal. Beginning about 10,000 yr BP the sea once again began to rise, and by about 5,000 yr BP the oceans reached their present level (Curray, 1965: 725) . Hence, the islands of the Sunda Shelf have been geographically isolated for at least 5,000 yr. Evidence from the distribution of C. prevosti and other mammals of this region (Fooden, 1975, and Heaney, unpublished data) indicates little or no subsequent colonization of the islands following the last glacial period with its associated low sea level. A comparable situation has been reported for terrestrial mammals on mountaintops in the North American Great Basin (Brown, 1971) . Table 1 contains data on each of the islands where C. preuosti has been found.",

There are several archipelagoes within the range of C. prevosti that are in deeper water (e.g., the North N atuna Islands and the Anambas Islands) on which they are absent; they are also absent from Java, to which they certainly had access during the Pleistocene. The significance of their absence from the archipelagoes is unclear at present. I suspect that their absence from Java may be related to the drier climate and absence of primary rain forest on that island, caused by the \"rain- shadow\" effect of Australia, but no certain evidence is available to support this.",

The great variability in body size among the different subspecies is immediately apparent. The range in body size is from 198 mm to 274 mm, a difference of 76 mm, or 38%. Although no weights are available, this probably represents a 200-250% difference in weight, based on other species of squirrels of similar body size. From the left-hand side of the curve, where the squirrels and the islands on which they occur are smallest, the squirrels gradually increase in length to a maximum while island area increases from about 4 km 2 to about 10,000 km\". From this apical point the mean body size of the squirrels decreases 22 mm (mean sizes of squirrels from the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, and Borneo are 258, 257, and 246 mm, respectively) and island area increases to about 7.5 X 10 5 km''. The Malay Peninsula south of the Isthmus of Kra is henceforth treated as an \"island\"; this is justified both in view of the distribution of C. prevosti, and of the distinctness of the fauna of the Peninsula. The northern boundary of the peninsular fauna is the Isthmus of Kra, an area of rapid climatic and vegetational change (Chasen, 1940:ix-x) . The data provided in Table 1 were analyzed using a stepwise multiple regression (BMD02R); the results are shown in Table 2 . Depth of water to the nearest large island (Borneo, Sumatra, or the Malay Peninsula) is significantly correlated with distance from the nearest large island, and has a significant negative correlation with areas of the islands; both correlations are to be expected due to the physiographic features of the Sunda Shelf, as discussed above. Log of island area and log of island area squared show the same expected correlations. Body length of the squirrels is significantly negatively correlated with distance to the nearest large island and depth of water toward the nearest large island. Log of island area is not strongly correlated with body size, but this is to be expected because, as shown in Fig. 2 , the relationship appears to be curvilinear rather than linear. To allow a curvilinear fit, the log of island area was squared; the fit described by the curvilinear relationship shown in Fig. 2 accounts for 69.3% of the variation, whereas the linear fit accounts for only 16.7% of the variation. The correlations of body length with distance and depth of water could be due largely to the high correlations of island area with these variables.",

In a survey of insular mammals, Foster Columbia (Foster, 1965) ; B = tri-colored squirrels (CaUosciurus prevosti) in Indonesia and Malaysia (this study); C =Mediterranean dwarf elephants (Elaphas jalconeri) from the Pleistocene of Europe (Maglio, 1973) . (1965:99) found that of 15 species of carnivores, 13 were smaller on islands; of 11 artiodactyls, nine were smaller on islands; and of nine lagomorphs, six were smaller on islands. Many large mammals that were isolated on islands during the Pleistocene exhibited dwarfism, especially elephants, hippopotami, deer, goats, and ground sloths (Kurten, 1972:213; Hooijer, 1967; Sondaar and Boekschoten, 1967) . Hooijer (1949) has noted that five groups of large mammals (tapir, orangutan, porcupine, tiger, and several species of rhinoceroses) which reached Sumatra and Java in the late Pliocene or, more likely, the early Pleistocene, underwent gradual diminution of size; those on Java became smaller than their conspecifics on Sumatra. Maglio (1973: 42 ; see also Sondaar and Boekschoten, 1967) stated that five taxa of Pleistocene dwarf elephants from four islands in the Mediterranean represent successive stages of dwarfing of a single species, Elaphas falconeri, closely related to and possibly conspecific with the large mainland form, Eiaphos namadicus. These taxa, in order of size from largest to smallest, are from Malta, Sardinia, Cyprus, and Crete. During much of the Pleistocene, Malta was connected to Sicily, and Sardinia was joined with Corsica (Charlesworth, 1957 (Charlesworth, :1226 (Charlesworth, , 1227 . Assuming that these elephants ranged over both islands in each case, the order of island size, from largest to smallest, is Malta (plus Sicily), Sardinia (plus Corsica) , Cyprus, and Crete, the same order as for elephant size; in other words, the size of the elephants was directly proportional to the size of the island on which they lived. This trend in body size of large mammals related to island area is represented in Fig. 3c .",

In the case of Mus musculus, Clethrionomys glareolus and the Apodemus sylvaticus species group on the islands off the coasts of Scotland, Ireland, and England, there has has been a substantial increase in body size of all populations since introduction in late prehistoric or early historic times (Corbet, 1961 (Corbet, , 1964 Berry, 1964 Berry, , 1969 Handford and Pernetta, 1974) . The presence of giant rats, mice, and pikas on islands during the Pleistocene have been noted for the Mediterranean (Kurten, 1972: 214) , Caribbean (Hooijer, 1967) , and other regions. Foster (1965) noted that insular insectivores do not show any clear trends in size variation (but see also Van Valen, 1973) . Foster (1965) conducted a study of the mammals of the Queen Charlotte Islands, which lie off the southwestern coast of British Columbia, with special attention given to Peromyscus maniculatus and P. sitkensis. He regarded the two taxa as conspecific, and found a tendency for the body size of the mice to increase with distance from the mainland, and related this tendency to the degree of isolation and concomitant changes in insular species diversity and predation. These causal factors are discussed below. Foster also noted that the islands usually decrease in area as distance from the mainland increases, and that only a few of the large but quite isolated islands have the large mice. This trend for the body size of small mammals to increase as island area decreases is represented in Fig. 3a . The few exceptions to this trend, i.e., the large Peromyscus on the larger, species-poor, isolated islands, are considered to be supportive of the hypothesis offered below. Redfield (1976) has studied the same species in a neighboring archipelago of very small islands. He found no clear relationship between island area and body size, although most island mice were heavier than mainland mice. Although his data on this subject are more limited than those of Foster, they may contradict my interpretation, and indicate the need for further, more detailed studies.",

                "text": "The series of curves shown in Fig. 3 suggests that the graph of body size plotted against island area for any mammal occurring on a series of islands of varying sizes would form a curve. The position of the apex along the ordinate is determined by the greatest size of the animal. The curve for small mammals is shifted to the left, and the curve for large mammals is shifted to the right. If a species is sufficiently large or small, only one side of the curve may be represented; in fact, this is anticipated to be the case for most species of mammals. The presence of intermediate species is critical to interpretation of the body size of insular mammals; that the relationship postulated here has not been noted previously may be due in large part to the rarity of such species of intermediate size (see Bourliere, 1975) . Carlquist (1974) , Foster (1965) , and others have suggested that isolation is a principal contributor to body size change; isolation is usually approximated by measuring the distance from an island to the mainland. The only manner in which I can envision isolation per se affecting body size is through inbreeding, loss of genetic variability, and subsequent loss of overall fitness. Such an explanation is tenuous because it suggests no mechanism and leaves unexplained the phenomenon of large and small mammals responding oppositely in body size changes on small islands, or the unusual case of a dual response by Callosciurus prevosti described in this paper (see Berry and Jakobson, 1975) . I believe that the correlation between \"isolation,\" as measured by distance, with body size is spurious, and is due to a tendency for island area to decrease with distance from the nearest large body of land, due to sloping off of the continental shelf. This could be tested by comparing mammals on islands of the same area, but of different distances to a large land mass. If my hypothesis is correct, a given species should be approximately the same size on each, rather than showing random fluctuations. The reason for the predicted relationship between body size and island area is that there are factors which may be expected to vary regularly with island area, due largely to the availability of resources. These factors have all been discussed previously by many authors, and include food limitation, predation, interspecific competition, and selection for physiological efficiency. All are closely correlated and affected by each other, and discrimination of one as the sole or primary factor in body size change is likely to be difficult. I have attempted to separate them as much as possible in the following discussion.",

In this paper I use \"food limitation\" to refer to the smaIl biomass available for consumption on a small island; this applies to carnivores as well as herbivores. This situation is quite different from a large island or continent in which large amounts of food are present, but competition limits a species to using only a small part of it. In a sense, they are opposite sides of the same coin, but, as noted here, they are most important at opposite ends of the land-mass spectrum, and are worthy of consideration as distinct phenomena. Because large mammals require vastly more energy than small mammals, they should be more strongly affected by isolation on a given island than are the small mammals on the island. Many mammals do not breed unless they reach a minimum weight, as well as a minimum age, and may skip a reproductive season as adults because they are below this weight threshold. Selection should favor individuals which breed at a small size when the population is food-stressed. Continued selection would result in gradually decreasing body size until other factors selecting for larger body size became more important.",

Because species diversity decreases with decreasing island area (MacArthur and Wilson, 1967) , predation might be expected to decline as the number of both predator and prey species declines. This would result in a gradual drop in pressure from predation as island area decreases, rather than being simply present or absent. On very small islands predators frequently are not present and thus exert no selective pressure at all on prey species on these islands (MacArthur and Wilson, 1967:151; Foster, 1965:110; Kurten, 1972:214) . Predation probably affects the body size of small and large mammals in opposite ways, due to their different means of avoiding predation; small mammals usually escape predators by dashing down the nearest hole, or running into a thick tangle of brush, while large mammals respond by attempting to outrun, dodge, or physically overwhelm the predator.",

Few studies have documented the effect on body size of complex competitor interactions, especially among mammals. Brown (1975) has shown that competition among rodents of North American desert communities causes regular spacing in body size, and that mean niche overlap increases with species richness, due especially to the addition of medium-size and small species. Thus, increased competition is associated with decreased mean body size of the competitors, not because the body size of a given species decreased with increased competition; rather, most species stayed the same size or were slightly larger. If an increase in number of competitors in a community allows new species only at the small end of the range of body size, and if no small species are available to fill the niche, selection might act to lower the size of some or all members to take advantage of the new niche space. McNab (1971) suggested that decreased competition among squirrels and among weasels, along with smaller food particle size, may cause observed increases in body size in high latitudes (see also Soule, 1966) . Conversely, Grant (1965) has argued that lack of competition of rodents on islands has caused selection for larger body size to allow for use of a wider variety of foods.",

In hot climates intermediate sized animals are at a disadvantage, for they can neither store the heat, nor dissipate it as quickly as can a small mammal. Large mammals store about the same amount of fat proportionate to body weight as small mammals, but are able to use it at a lower rate, and so are able to survive longer periods of dormancy (Morrison, 1960) . Large mammals lose relatively less water through surface evaporation than small mammals.

The exact placement of the curves is meant to reflect what I believe to be the most commonly accepted views of these factors. For example, predation is often absent from small islands, is of less importance than competition when species diversity is high, and probably declines in importance less rapidly than either competition or food limitation. The importance of physiological efficiency probably varies greatly for different species under different climates; it is placed low on this graph only because I do not feel that it is of much importance to the squirrels.

The time required for the body size of mammals to change substantially is not known; the studies on Apodemus and Clethrionomys cited above indicate that it may be as little as several thousand years, and a study of Mus suggests that major changes are possible in 70 yr (Berry, 1964; Berry and ]akobson, 1975) . Until the necessary time period is known more precisely for a representative sample of mammals, it is necessary to include in any general predictions of changes in body size the stipulation that the islands and mammals in question were isolated for roughly the same length of time.

Still larger species, including carnivores such as Arctogalidia trivirgata and artiodactyls such as Tragulus napu, should show only a steady decline in size as island area decreases. Mammals slightly smaller than C. prevosti, such as C. notatus and many of the other sciurids, should gradually increase in size as area increases, peak in body size on islands some degree smaller than those on which C. prevosti peaks, and decline in body size thereafter. Still smaller species, including many of SUMMARY Callosciurus prevosti occurs throughout Malaysia and much of Indonesia; it is generally restricted to the Sunda Shelf, a continental shelf underlying the Greater Sunda Islands, the Malay Peninsula, and adjacent archipelagoes. The islands on which it has been found range in size from 4-7.5 X 10 5 km'', Earlier studies have found that the Sunda Shelf was exposed as dry land during the Pleistocene; this allowed terrestrial mammals including C. prevosti, to reach the islands by overland dispersal and suggests geographic isolation for about 5,000 yr.",

Life history data would be useful in evaluating the effects of the presumed causal factors. Predictions of trends on smaller islands versus larger islands are as follows. Reduced predation would allow smaller litter sizes, and a smaller proportion of young in the population; greater food limitation would result in a greater diversity of habitat utilization, and change in proportion of time spent in various habitats. Techniques for directly measuring the effects of the four factors on mammalian populations, especially in reference to their influence on body size, have not yet been proposed.
