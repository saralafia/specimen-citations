The expansion of the Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana Kerr, 1792) into Michigan has been documented over the past 200 years, indicating relatively new colonizations in northern Michigan. While most contemporary expansions are a result of shifts in climate regimes, the opossum has spread beyond its hypothesized climate niche, offering an opportunity to examine the compounding influence that climate change and humans have on a species' distribution. The genetic consequences of two range expansions were investigated using genotypic data for nine microsatellite markers from opossums collected in Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin. Two genetic clusters were identified: one on either side of Lake Michigan. Using general linear models, we found that measurements of genetic diversity across fifteen counties are best explained by days of snow on the ground. Next best models incorporate anthropogenic covariates including farm density. These models suggest opossum expansion may be facilitated by agricultural land development and at the same time be limited by their inability to forage in snow.",

Some expansions have been impeded by urban sprawl, with these species relying on patches of forested areas and derelict land to expand through urban areas (Gilchrist et al. 2015) .",

The genus, Didelphis, was part of the Great American Interchange, spreading into North America from South America approximately 800 000 years ago (Graham and Lundelius 2010) . Historical documentation from fur trappers and naturalists have allowed for a rough estimate of the timing of the opossum's continued expansion into the Midwestern United States. As recently as 1600, the opossum's northern range was limited to northern Ohio (reviewed by McManus 1974) . Opossums were first observed in southern Wisconsin in the 1850s and, as their population grew in the 1920s, they began to spread further north (Jackson 1961) . In the adjacent Upper Peninsula of Michigan (UP; 1980s, but opossums have yet to reach the eastern half of the UP (Myers et al. 2009) . It is speculated that land clearing in the 1820s and 1830s facilitated expansion of D. virginiana into the Lower Peninsula of Michigan (Fig. 2 ), but the species did not become common in southern Michigan until the 1920s (Dice 1927 Baker 1983) . Opossums were first observed in the northern half of the lower peninsula in the 1940s, but were not considered well established until 1990 (Burt 1948; Myers et al. 2009) .",

Opossums collared with GPS units in Michigan had home ranges calculated between 10.9 and 200 hectares, depending on the equation used, with no difference between sexes (Walter et al. 2013) . Opossums must be able to forage at least 35 days in the winter to avoid starvation, and they do not forage when temperatures are below -2\u00b0C or in deep snow, which hinders locomotion (Brocke 1970) . Based on these observations, it has long been hypothesized that the opossum's continued expansion in Michigan was due to warming temperatures associated with climate change (Brocke 1970; Myers et al. 2009 ). However, a study that modeled opossum demographic data demonstrates that a winter survival rate of \u2265 0.67 is required to sustain opossum populations at northern latitudes (Kanda and Fuller 2004) . This survival rate is higher than would be predicted based on their physiology even with winter temperatures ameliorated by climate change. Because climate change alone cannot explain why opossums have expanded so far north, Kanda proposed that urbanization has facilitated opossum survival in northern parts of their range (2005).",

Habitat variables at the state level were determined to be too coarse-grained, and we therefore tested the influence of human development and climate on opossum genetic diversity at the county level. Counties with n > 3 or multiple adjacent counties with combined n > 3 were identified as regions to conduct a preliminary evaluation of putative influences on opossum genetic diversity. By sampling regions with 3-20 individuals, a sufficient number of regions were made available to conduct a general linear model and at least six alleles could be used in standardizing allelic richness across regions (Szpiech et al. 2008) . While small samples sizes may not reveal the true allelic diversity, rarefaction can allow for accurate comparisons between populations. In a study comparing a diverse population to a known lowdiversity population, a random sample of five individuals was sufficient to correctly reveal the low-diversity population using measures of rarified allelic richness (Pruett and Winker 2008) .",

To calculate density measurements for regions containing multiple counties, raw census data were summed and density was calculated using the total land surface area of relevant counties ( Supplementary Table S2 ). 2 Climate data for the 11 regions were collected from 1992 to 2013, as each region has been occupied by opossums for at least twenty years (Myers et al. 2009) . County data for each region were downloaded from the National Climate Data center, http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdoweb/search (accessed July, 2015), averaged, and analyzed in R (R Development Core Team 2014) to find the annual average maximum snow depth, 20-year extreme maximum snow depth, and annual average number of days with at least one inch (2.54 cm) of snow on the ground per region. Annual average daily minimum winter temperature (December-February) for each region was also calculated. The number of days in which the minimum or maximum temperature fell below freezing was collected as annual sums and averaged. When years had data from multiple weather stations, the values were averaged (Supplementary Table S2 ). 2 Allelic richness and private allele richness were rarefied to a g of 3 for each region using ADZE 1.0 (Szpiech et al. 2008) . There was no correlation between sample size and either rarefied allelic richness or private allele richness (Pearson coefficients = -0.294 and 0.04, respectively). General linear models were designed using the generalized linear model option in SPSS 22 (IBM 2013) with a linear response and factorial model to examine anthropogenic variables, climate variables, and a combination. The full factorial model creates all possible interactions and main effects for variables considered within a model. Covariates were D r a f t standardized using the R package \"arm\" which allows for the input variables to be centered along the mean and divided by two standard deviations (Gelman 2008 ). An intercept-only model was created to serve as the null model. Model performances were measured using AIC c , Akaike's information criterion adjusted for number of covariates in a model, and compared using \u2206AIC c (AIC ci -AIC cMIN ). Models with a \u2206AIC c value less than two are considered to have substantial support (Burnham and Anderson 2002) .",

The large geographic range of each cluster (both greater than 100,000 km 2 ) indicates substantial gene flow in Midwestern opossums (Fig. 3b) , and coincides with previous findings that opossums across Indiana belonged to a single genetic cluster (Hennessy et al. 2014) . Numerous geographic outliers suggest long distance dispersal facilitated by humans. While isolation-by-distance was tested for all samples and within each geographic cluster, only the samples west of Lake Michigan showed significant, slight isolation-by-distance. This suggests that distance alone D r a f t cannot explain the two clusters identified on either side of Lake Michigan. The presence of two clusters of D. virginiana, a nomadic species with negligible philopatry (reviewed by Gardner and Sunquist 2003) , suggests independent colonization of the two regions on either side of Lake Michigan. A more comprehensive evaluation of the opossum's entire range using more conservative markers than microsatellites could reveal deeper historical patterns of the opossum's expansion northward since the Pleistocene (Graham and Lundelius 2010).",

Based on thermoregulation studies conducted in the 1960s, it was assumed that the opossum's northern range in Michigan was closely linked to winter temperatures (Brocke 1970; Myers et al. 2009) . However, opossums have been observed beyond the temperature niche Brocke prescribed (Kanda and Fuller 2004) , and the top models in our study suggest that opossum populations are more impacted by the presence and longevity of snow than by harsh winter temperatures. The analysis of human variables and how they are related to diversity measurements suggest that agricultural lands are providing significant resources for Midwestern opossums and with D r a f t substantial gene flow across the study area, it appears that little is limiting the dispersal of opossums in this region apart from time.",

                "text": "Conclusions based on this study are potentially limited by sample size, i.e. 85 individuals across a large geographic area. However, based on previous population studies conducted in Indiana, in which opossums throughout the state clustered as one genetic unit, it is unlikely that substantial structure was missed with 85 opossums (Hennessy et al. 2014) . Although the question of biasing samples by collecting roadkill might be raised, opossum populations have not been found to be structured by roads (Beatty et al. 2012; Hennessy et al. 2014) , and roadkill opossums were found in urban, suburban, and rural areas. The analysis of putative factors influencing opossum colonization and survival is limited by using regions with low sample sizes. While rarefaction helps mitigate discrepancies between sample sizes, the calculations of diversity are not as accurate because of the limited input of data. This limitation is especially noticeable in our P R models, in which the intercept-only was a competitive model. These GLMs were designed as a preliminary analysis, and they suggest that both climate and human land use influence opossum survival. Mark-recapture and isotope studies, as well as more widespread genetic analyses, can help further elucidate the factors ultimately driving the opossum's expansion.",

The opossum appears to have capitalized on land use change over the past 200 years, and it is likely to continue its expansion into the northern Midwest, as evidenced by its recent appearance in North Dakota (Walsh, L.L., Seabloom, R., and C.W. Thompson, submitted, The Prairie Naturalist) . Allelic richness is used as a predictor for evolutionary potential (Kalinowski 2004) , and the relatively high measurements in both edge regions suggest opossums D r a f t in the Midwest have a relatively high potential for adapting to novel communities. As a scavenger, they have positive effects on ecosystem services (Olson et al. 2012) . However, they also carry parasites that have detrimental health effects on domestic animals including horses (Fenger et al. 1995) . Because of the multiple factors influencing the opossum's successful colonization, and the multiple effects they will have in new areas, the Virginia opossum continues to serve as a promising system to study range expansions.
