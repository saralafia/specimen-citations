                "text": "There is a diversity ofviews regarding the number and composition of skull components that might have some degree of autonomy. While some authors have perceived the skull as a single growth system (Weidenreich, 1941; Brash, 1934) , others have counted up to 36 anatomical subunits within the skull (van der Klaauw, 1946 Klaauw, , 1948 Klaauw, -1952 . These subunits, however, were not regarded as autonomous; they were grouped into more inclusive units, forming a hierarchy of components, each with some degree of individuality. At the highest level of the hierarchy, the neural and facial complexes have been viewed as integrated units (e.g., Bluntschli, 1925; Stadtmueller, 1936; Deggeler, 1942; van der Klaauw, 1948 van der Klaauw, -1952 Moss and Young, 1960; Moore, 1966 Moore, , 1981 . The contrast between the neural and facial components is reflected in the familiar description of mammalian skull allometry: the precocial growth ofthe neural skull contrasts with the more protracted growth of the face. As mammals age, their faces become relatively elongated with respect to the cranial base and braincase. More generally, the shape of the skull of terrestrial vertebrates has been interpreted as an outcome of processes affecting these components ofthe skull separately (van der Klaauw, 1948 Klaauw, -1952 .",

According to this view, the cranial base and face form a complex in their independence of brain growth, but can be distinguished from each other by their differing regionally-specific growth patterns. More detailed studies of basicranial growth suggest that there may be different growth patterns in different regions of the cranial base, and that taxa differ in the relative growth rates of the anterior and posterior regions of the cranial base. In primates, the anterior region ofthe cranial base apparently resembles the face in its pattern ofgrowth (Zuckerman, 1955; Ashton, 1957) , while in rodents, the anterior and posterior portions of the cranial base both follow the pattern typical of the braincase (Moore, 1966) . Still, despite the differences among taxa, and the possibility that the cranial base comprises two regions with different growth rates, many studies explain craniofacial growth in terms of facial-specific and neural-specific factors.",

There is little doubt that many developmental factors have quite localized effects. Bone growth and deposition are highly localized processes, involving incremental addition of bone at sutures and on surfaces and interstitial growth of the persistent cartilages (Bjork, 1955 (Bjork, , 1966 Selman and Sarnat, 1955; van Limborgh, 1972; Ranly, 1988) . Several developmental anomalies lead to spatially delimited malformations. For example, a hematoma of the stapedial artery leads to destruction or disorganization of differentiating mesenchyme only in the region of the developing mandibular ramus (Poswillo, 1988) . Genetic effects on the extent of growth activity in the mandible also seem to be quite restricted in their spatial extent (Bailey, 1985) . Van Limborgh (1972) has argued that such local epigenetic factors dominate regional or more general factors during growth.",

That the skull is a complex ofseveral distinct units has been viewed as one reason for the tremendous diversity of skull morphology relative to the less impressive diversity of the developmentally more simple limb (Lauder et al., 1989 ). Yet we still know little about the number of developmental units, or their hierarchical arrangement, or the ontogenetic changes in the number ofintegrated units in any taxon. Thus, we cannot yet ask whether clades characterized by relatively high levels of skull diversity differ from those characterized by low levels ofdiversity in their extent or pattern of developmental integration. This ignorance also compromises studies comparing ontogenies of skull form across taxa because, without precise descriptions of how skull ontogeny is integrated, we cannot construct ontogenetic trajectories for components of the skull.",

Most ofthe problems owe to the difficulty of expressing these transformations in a convenient set of descriptors leading to a tractable statistical analysis. Some recent attempts at convenient descriptors (Bookstein, 1978) did not support statistics, and, conversely, new developments in the statistics of landmark data did not support descriptions as Cartesian deformations, as argued in the context of the finite-element method by Bookstein (1987) . The duality of purposes has been bridged only very recently, with the introduction ofa method (Bookstein, 1989 (Bookstein, , 1992 supplying a basis for description of shape variation in the form of multiple superimposable Cartesian deformations. Using the method of thin-plate spines, the investigator can, in one biometric context, calculate a Thompson-style deformation relating means of forms, decompose it into \"partial warps\" -large-scale and progressive1ymore localized components of the deformationand carry out a wide variety of rigorous multivariate tests of the resulting descriptors. The method has been previously ap-plied in systematics (cf. Rohlf and Bookstein, 1990) and the extension to the analysis ofontogeny might also be useful in that context. We use this method here to examine the spatiotemporal patterning of changes in skull form of the mean cotton rat over the first 30 days of postnatal ontogeny.",

Figure 1 shows one individual of each age. Discrete points, \"landmarks\" (Fig. 2 ; described in Table 1 ) that could be recognized in forms from neonate through adult, were digitized from these photographs. Our analysis is thus restricted to the two-dimensional projection of the three-dimensional form visible in these photographs. These points were chosen to cover the entire form as closely and evenly as possible. The restriction ofthe available information to discrete landmark locations is not as severe a limitation as it might seem. When landmarks fairly well cover the periphery of a form, any growth inside will leave its traces in their displacements upon the boundary; Table I ). The baseline points used to construct shape coordinates are I (mid-IF) and 2 (mid-BO). when there are, in addition, interior landmarks ( Fig. 2) , we have access to subtle evidence of gradients as well. The ways in which biological explanations are entailed in analysis of landmarks (Bookstein, 1992; pp. 63-66) include most of the types of explanations familiar in craniology. And while landmarks do not explicitly archive information about the curving of form in-between them, in practice they seem to include enough of that information to fairly represent the statistics of the curving. Thus, a data set of landmark locations is a reasonable basis for weighing alternate theories of integration, even though we do not claim to have recorded details of the growth mechanisms that brought about that integration.",

The two baseline points are far apart from each other and close to their contralaterals, and were easily located in all specimens. The mean landmark configurations for each age are shown in Figure 3 . The construction of the mean forms depends negligibly on this choice of baseline, which is mainly for graphical convenience (Bookstein, 1992; Appendix 2; Goodall, 1991) . Once the forms are averaged there is no further reference to a baseline in the analysis that follows. In particular, the depictions of partial warps as displacements, Figures 5, 6, and 8, while they appear to be expressed in an arbitrary coordinate system, are actually computed in a manner that is coordinate-free.

The method can be explained using a physical metaphor in which relative displacements of landmark points in the x,y plane are depicted as if they were \"vertical\" -as if they were transferred to the z-coordinate of an infinite, uniform, infinitely thin metal plate tacked at a given \"height\" (the new form) above the landmarks of an \"old\" form. The conformation of the surface of this plate is described by a function minimizing physical bending energy, which is a simple function ofthe bending (second derivatives) of this artificial z-coordinate. Should we treat this \"vertical\" as if it were instead added to one of the original Cartesian coordinates (x or y), there results a picture of deformation instead of \"bending\" -a mapping from one picture to another that extends the correspondence to the tissues in between, where there are no data. Another way to think about this is as if one form were printed on a transparent stiff plastic sheet and then manipulated by bending so that its shadow takes on the prescribed landmark positions of the second form. Our job as biometricians is to describe both the tilting and the bending that were required. The mathematics of this description works perfectly well for data in three dimensions also, though one's mental imagery is stretched in the task of visualizing the resulting six-dimensional \"bending.\"",

A closer inspection of this so-called bending energy matrix (by eigenanalysis) yields two complementary subspaces for the analysis of shape change. One ofthese, with no bending energy, describes homogeneous, affine transformations, those that leave parallel lines parallel. These are called uniform because the same transformation occurs everywhere; if a rectangular grid were superimposed on the form (as in Fig. 4b ), every small square of this grid would be transformed to the same parallelogram in the same orientation.

The form labeIled \"I\" here (the location) of landmarks of the mean l-day-old form) is used for the computation of all the principal warps in our analysis. Because the visual impact of figures such as this is a function of baseline, findings cannot be directly interpreted by reference to these vectors alone (Bookstein, 1992 ; Ch. 7). of the corresponding partial deformations. The uniform transformations can be considered to be at \"infinite\" scale; we will also refer to them as \"on Principal Warp 0.\" Demonstrations of the decomposition of a shape change into all its partial warps are presented in Bookstein, 1992 (pp. 324-339) , and the matter is discussed with another cranial example in Reyment, 1991. The principal warps are purely geometric features ofthe mean form which can be used to calibrate comparisons. In other words, they are a function only of the locations of landmarks, or, more precisely, the pairwise distances among all landmarks, in the \"starting\" form. There is no biological information either in the number of these principal warps, which is determined by the number oflandmarks, nor in the coefficients for each landmark in these eigenvectors. Rather, these principal warps provide a basis for comparison, a list of features, each progressively more localized, for compari-sons of differences between forms. In this they are analogous to sets of Fourier coefficients for comparisons of closed outlines (Rohlf and Bookstein, 1990) , except that they have different shapes for different mean landmark configurations. The contribution of each warp, and the direction in which that contribution is oriented, reexpress changes in the locations oflandmarks using the geometry of the mean \"starting\" form. Between each pair ofages (1-10, 10-20, 20-30) each principal warp combines with its vector multiplier to form a partial warp, describing how the principal warp is realized in that shape change. The summation of all the partial warps, including the uniform term (Warp 0), yields exactly the reconfiguration of landmarks observed. For more on all aspects of this decomposition, see Bookstein, 1991; pp. 326-336 Inasmuch as integration is usually thought of as dealing with \"correlates of growth,\" it may be helpful to indicate the sense of the word \"correlation\" we are invoking for it here. Our \"correlations\" will be those involving particular weighted combinations oflandmark displacements. The patterns of weights are the principal warps, and the extent to which they are realized in the ageto-age changes are the partial warps for those changes. One might also consider correlations among the landmark positions across the set of all the skulls at each age. These correlations are analyzed in another paper (Zelditch et aI., unpubl. data) using a different method, the technique of relative warps (Bookstein, 1992) .",

There results an exhaustive decomposition of all the details of these landmark reconfigurations, allowing us to compare changes across age intervals at each ofa number ofdifferent scales and regions. To assess the statistical significance of the partial warps, we very conservatively restricted ourselves to pairs of successive ages, applying Hotelling's P to the scores computed for the x and y components of the partial warps for the individuals in the pairs of samples. The ontogenetic trajectory for the uniform component is calculated and tested according to the factor approximation (Rohlf and Bookstein, 1990; p. 243) . In addition to warps describing changes ofmean form from age to age, we also computed partial warps describing deviations of each form from its own age-specific mean. (The variances of these warps are used by the T2 tests of mean change just mentioned.)

To develop this surface into a feature of shape change, it must be multiplied by a vector (a direction and magnitude) in the plane of the landmarks. Before turning to our actual data, it is useful to introduce graphical conventions for this sort of display. When oriented in the x-direction (in this case, along the anteroposterior skull axis), the resulting partial warp describes a relative displacement of the middle points towards the anterior or posterior end (shown in Fig. 5b.l) ; this is equivalent to a picture ofa graded relative elongation or shortening (Fig. 5b.2) . When oriented in the y-direction (in this case, along the mediolateral skull axis), this aspect of shape change can be described as a displacement of anterior and posterior points towards or away from the midline of the skull relative to the middle points ( Fig. 5c.l) ; it is equivalent to a nonuniform narrowing of the middle, relative to the ends (Fig. 5c.2) . This most global nonuniformity can also be oriented in between these possibilities, for example, at 45\u00b0t o either axis (Figs. 5d.l, 5d .2).

As evident in Figure 7 , there is significant change at all but two of these levels during the first 10 days ofgrowth. Few of these geometric possibilities are realized in the comparisons between 10-and 20-day old forms, and the trajectory for the most global feature is substantially longer (i.e., it encompasses considerably more net geometric change) than those for the more localized features. While there is little shape change over the final interval, compared to that observed over the first 20 days of growth, and while even fewer of the geometric possibilities are realized during this interval than during the previous one, there is a lessening ofthe dominance ofthe global and uniform components. That is, there is a lesser tendency to localization in the interval between 10-and 20-day-old forms than in the earlier and later stages.

Ifwe had measured the distance from our most anterior landmark to one ofthe posterior facial landmarks, and had measured another line segment connecting anterior and posterior landmarks on the cranial base, we would have found that the length of the face increases relative to that of the cranial base over these 30 days. Had facial and neural skull had region-specific rates ofelongation, it would follow that the rates were different. But it does not follow that facial and neural regions have homogeneous region-specific growth rates (Bookstein, 1992; pp. 35-36) . The conventional measures and techniques are inade-quate for studies of whether growth rates are localized. These data allow us to inspect the spatial organization of growth rates; when we do, we find no evidence of regionallyspecific facial and basicranial growth rates or timings here. There are plenty of landmarks available to show substantial \"disintegration\" of facial and braincase growth if it could be shown that they were separately regulated. What we see is that there is little evidence for any geometric separation of growth in these regions from that pattern by which they participate in one single global gradient.",

During the youngest interval examined here (1-10 days postnatal), 11 ofthe possible 13 partial warps (nonuniform components of skull deformation) contribute statistically significantly to net geometric shape change. Although the loadings for the global anteroposterior gradient are relatively high, by itself it is not an adequate summary of the observed skull growth. During the second interval (10-20 days postnatal), only a few of the more localized components still contribute to geometric shape change, while the uniform component and the global skull-wide gradient still dominate growth. Elsewhere, we have suggested the ratios ofsummed squared loadings of the global warps (both uniform and nonuniform) to the more localized warps as reasonable measures of the amount of integration (Bookstein et al., unpubl, data) . Using this ratio, it appears that integration increases shortly before weaning, whereas the number of developmentally localized regions seems to decrease. A previous study of the ontogeny of developmental integration in Sigmodon has also found a transition in the pattern of integration prior to weaning (Zelditch and Carmichael, 1989b) .

The Procrustes superposition leads to the interpretation of nonlinearity separately landmark by landmark; a subsequent discussion would informally at-tempt to synthesize these verbally into more-or-less extended patterns and neighborhoods (cf. Rohlf, 1990) . The finite-element approach, highlighting local variation in linear approximations to regional aspects ofgrowth deformation, would require quite a bit more effort to arrive at specifically more global and more local aspects ofthe changes. And the thin-plate spline pictures are simply the stack of all 14 of our partial warps, which are, by design, the features by which, in our view, they are most conveniently reported.",

Our judgement is not a statistical one-all these and many other decompositions of shape have precisely the same multivariate statisticsbut a biological one. In the decomposition of an observed ontogeny into the summation of geometrically orthogonal features at distinct scales and locations, we find a useful guide to the nature and size of the \"parts\" the ontogeny is integrating. The spectrum ofpossible \"parts\" is a geometric derivation from the mean landmark configuration, but the list of \"parts\" actually realized, as conveyed in the magnitudes and directions of the partial warps, is entirely an empirical matter. Finite-element analyses require the specification of those parts in advance, and Procrustes methods atomize the same nonlinearities as a list of \"residuals\" landmark by landmark. The present approach may be considered to assemble all these residuals over and over, according to a series of overlapping patterns, each a function ofthe mean form, at its own specific spatial scale. There are other ways to tell the story ofspatiotemporal allometry in these Sigmodon landmarks, but our version is complete both geometrically and statistically; every other complete story is a rearrangement of this one.",

It is the variation among individuals in these features ofskull growth, and the covariation among these growing features, that influence how skull shape evolves. Virtually all of the age-related variation within Sigmodon (over these 30 days of growth) is at the global scales, and these global features of skull shape also dominate the within-age variation at the two older ages sampled here (Zelditch et aI., unpubl. data) . We do not know if Sigmodon is unusual in its extent of integration of growth, nor can we speculate on the degree to which growth is integrated in samples younger and older than those examined here. However, we suggest that any hypotheses based on the assumption of multiple independent developmental units ofthe skull be regarded with some caution. This is not to say that the conventional wisdom regarding mammalian skull growth is to be discarded. Facial and neural skulls could be under different growth controls that happen to be strongly correlated in normal development. We merely assert that in their geometry the data are more simply interpreted otherwise; the data do not entail only the usual particulate descriptions.",

Thus, empirically, matters are rather more complex than suggested by the heuristic diagrams presented in Alberch et ai. (1979) . It is in their very complexity that these trajectories provide a basis for exploring changes in the spatial distribution of developmental processes. Analysis of the spatial organization of growth should supplement studies of purely temporal phenomena, the subject of studies of heterochrony (evolutionary changes in developmental rate and timing). Heterochrony has emerged as the dominant paradigm for analyzing the evolutionary role of developmental processes (e.g., Gould, 1977 Gould, , 1982 Alberch and Alberch, 1981; Wake, 1980; McNamara, 1982; Hafner and Hafner, 1984; Hall, 1990b; Kellogg, 1990; Laurin and Garcia-Joral, 1990 ). This emphasis upon evolutionary change in temporal patterning has detracted from analysis of the evolutionary change in spatial patterning of development. Haeckel (1868) coined the term \"heterotopy\" as the complement of heterochrony, to refer to changes in the germ layer from which cells differentiate. The concept has been revived and extended recently by Wray and McClay (1989) , who take a broader view ofevolutionary changes in spatial patterning. No empirical studies have examined the influence of heterotopy on the evolution of skull form, although there is evidence that some primates differ in the spatial patterning of bone deposition and resorption (Bromage, 1985) . Despite the disproportionate attention paid to heterochrony, heterotopy may be equally important in evolution, albeit more difficult to analyze. While the curvatures and decelerations may complicate the study of heterochrony, they enable the study of heterotopy. The apparent ubiquity ofheterochrony and infrequency of heterotopy in our literature may be due not to the relative frequency of these phenomena but rather to the difficulty of studying evolutionary change in spatial patterning and the relative novelty of effective techniques for the thorough multivariate examination of geometric change.",
