In this study we projected the potential future geographic range of the EGS in California using Maxent to create an ecological niche model.

Research grade data from iNaturalist was obtained over the time period of 2004-2018. Range and habitat suitability maps were developed by mapping in ArcGIS. Three threshold selection methods were used to create different estimates of the potential future range of the EGS in California. The first method used the 10th percentile logistic threshold, the second used the minimum training presence logistic threshold, and the third used Jenks Natural Breaks.

The EGS is native to the deciduous forests of the eastern United States (Koprowski 1994) . The species was introduced to California in 1939 at Stanford University and in 1943 at Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, but it may have been introduced earlier by settlers who frequently introduced species from their homes in the eastern United States (Byrne 1979) . Populations of the EGS currently exist in developed and forested areas of California. They are currently widespread throughout central California, with concentrations around Sacramento, both peninsulas of San Francisco Bay, and San Jose, and smaller populations in the Central Valley. Additionally, populations are spreading from Santa Cruz into the Santa Cruz Mountains and Monterey Peninsula (Creley and Muchlinski 2017) .",

Some EGSs in California are melanistic, a common trait in the northern portion of the native range (Thorington et al. 2012) . The EGS has a broad diet (Bertolino 2008) , can establish a population from a small number of founders (Wood et al. 2007) , can survive and reproduce in urban, suburban, or natural habitats, and has a favorable public perception (Bertolino and Genovesi 2003) , which all contribute to its invasive success. The species has been introduced to the western United States, Europe, Africa, and Australia (Bertolino 2008; Benson 2013; Bertolino and Lurz 2013; Bertolino et al. 2014) . Populations have been associated with negative ecosystem effects, the decline of native species, and damage to forests in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Italy, and parts of western North America (Gurnell et al. 2004; Bertolino 2008; Benson 2013; Bertolino and Lurz 2013) .",

Creley and Muchlinski (2017) mapped the species distribution within California as of 2015, but ENMs had not been made. The methodologies for creating ENMs for invasive species are not well established (Aguierre-Gutierrez et al. 2013; Uden et al. 2015) . It was important to map a range of suitable habitat estimates in order to prevent drawing conclusions from one arbitrary threshold, as cautioned against by Merow et al. (2013) . Standard thresholds that have been used in previous studies to produce ENMs include the 10 th percentile logistic threshold (Belarmain Fandohan et al. 2015; Chalghaf et al. 2016; Sage et al. 2017) , which could produce a very conservative estimate of potential future range for an invasive species, and the minimum training presence logistic threshold (Beane et al. 2013; Coudrat and Nekaris 2013; Botero-Delgadillo et al. 2015) , which could produce an overestimate of potential future range. We used these two standard thresholds in the present study, as well as a third method -selecting a threshold value based on Jenks Natural Breaks (Jenks 1967) . Previously, Colnar and Landis (2007) developed a regional risk assessment for the European green crab, Carcinus maenas, at Cherry Point, Washington, USA using Jenks Natural Breaks, and Schleier III and Sing (2008) used it to partition an overall risk score for the introduction of Gabusia affinis (western mosquitofish) into Montana watersheds. Beyond invasive species modeling, Jenks Natural Breaks have been used to classify groundwater into zones of vulnerability for nitrogen contamination in Florida's aquifers (Cui et al. 2016) , to rank the susceptibility of locations to terrorist actions (Patterson and Apostolakis 2007) , and to assess the risk of flooding in the Bengawan Solo River basin in Indonesia (Rahadianto et al. 2015) .",

                "text": "Our results indicate that the method for selecting a threshold value to establish a break between suitable and unsuitable habitat with Maxent is an especially critical issue for an introduced species which is expanding its geographic range. We have shown that a high AUC value by itself is not sufficient to support the predictive accuracy of a single map based upon a single arbitrarily selected threshold value. AUC is not a perfect, objective measure of the predictive power of the model, but few alternatives are available for presence only data (Merow et al. 2013) . The commonly used 10th percentile training presence logistic threshold as well as the minimum training presence logistic threshold are clearly arbitrary values with little biological basis for selection. And, as shown by the maps presented in this paper, these thresholds produce vastly different projections of suitable habitat. The use of Jenks Breaks to establish a threshold value is based upon the natural clustering of values in the logistic output of the model and hence should be less arbitrary, and more meaningful, in terms of the biology of the species being studied. This method also provides graded \"likelihoods\" of predicted occupancy, which may be more easily tested in the future with new occupancy records. The 10th percentile training presence logistic threshold provided the most conservative estimate of the potential range by assuming that some of the presence data may be misidentified, improperly reported, or outside of the area in which the EGS can persist, and then removing those points (Young et al. 2011; Uden et al. 2015) . The map is inherently skewed toward the realized niche of the EGS in California, as the species has only been introduced to a few locations within the state. It is closely aligned with the original data set and may be biased toward human accessible areas. The threshold may be too conservative, as the EGS is still spreading, and is likely to tolerate habitat with conditions at least as extreme as those in the current range in California. The EGS already inhabits areas outside of the region projected as suitable in this map.",

However, use of this threshold value most likely over-predicts the potential range because the inclusion of a single erroneous location point within the data could greatly affect the map. The map using this lower threshold provides an accurate estimate of potential range only if it is absolutely certain that all location data have been correctly identified as EGSs, and all individuals and populations currently exist in suitable habitat. While it is highly likely that the EGS will expand its range to include some of the areas mapped by this method, it is highly unlikely that the species will inhabit all of the area. If the EGS is introduced to or expands it range to new areas and survives, the distribution is likely to more closely resemble the maximum estimate map than the minimum estimate using the 10th percentile logistic threshold.",

We assume that the lowest ranking habitat, HC5, is unsuitable based upon the lowest grouping of values (0.000 to 0.0530), whereas each higher rank represents increasingly suitable habitat. As the EGS continues to spread, the habitat suitability ranking may increase in areas with habitat similar to newly invaded areas and therefore we cannot say that this map is a permanent ranking of habitat suitability. For example, areas now ranked as HC3 could in the future be ranked as HC2 if many populations of EGSs become established within HC3. We believe that setting the threshold for suitable habitat above HC5 created the most reasonable estimate of the potential future range by including a broader range of habitat than the minimum estimate, but excluding the most extreme desert, mountain, and Central Valley habitats of the maximum estimate.

Elevation alone may not actually exclude the EGS. The species' invasive ability worldwide, especially into areas with Mediterranean climates, such as South Africa and Italy (Gurnell et al. 2004; Bertolino 2008; Benson 2013; Bertolino and Lurz 2013) suggests that it could acclimate to conditions in much of California.",

                "text": "Finally, with future studies the potential invasion by the EGS into occupied and unoccupied eastern fox squirrel (EFS) or WGS habitat is an excellent test case for several hypotheses regarding invasion ecology. These hypotheses include, 1) \"biotic resistance\", which suggests that high-biodiversity ecosystems are more resistant to invasion than lowdiversity ecosystems; 2) \"enemy release\", which posits that the absence of enemies (i.e., competitors and predators) increases the likelihood of invasion; and 3) \"propagule pressure/introduction effort\", which proposes that the introduced population size and the frequency of introduction can contribute to successful invasion (Jeschke 2014) . The first hypothesis could be tested with the EFS by comparing the rate and success of invasion from neighboring areas of low and high-biodiversity systems (e.g., oak woodlands in the Sierra Nevada mountain foothills). The second hypothesis could be tested by comparing EGS invasion and persistence success with the presence of competitors (e.g., EFS or WGS) and predators, such as hawks and owls. Because the EGS tolerates urban and suburban areas, predators may be less prevalent in areas where they have succeeded. The third hypothesis could be tested using a combination of estimates (e.g., from historical accounts) or measurements (e.g., for newly-discovered populations) of founder population size and continued introduction (e.g., from connected populations) and reproductive rate to predict expansion and persistence. There is already some evidence that the EGS may be replacing the EFS on the western side of the San Francisco Bay (Creley and Muchlinski 2017) so assessing potential causal factors for replacement is important. Finally, the model uses current environmental conditions, and could be adapted to include estimates for changes in climate, which may reduce the amount of suitable habit, shift it to higher elevations, or render hotter and more extreme areas of currently suitable habitat unsuitable in the future.",
