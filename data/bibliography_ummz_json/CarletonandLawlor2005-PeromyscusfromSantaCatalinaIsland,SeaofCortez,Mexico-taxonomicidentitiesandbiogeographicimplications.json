                "text": "Santa Catalina is a small (41-km 2 ) oceanic island in the southern Sea of Cortez (Gulf of California), Mexico, situated 27 km northeast of Punta San Marcial on the Baja California Peninsula (Carre\u00f1o and Helenes 2002) . Although the endemic deer mouse Peromyscus slevini Mailliard (1924) is the only recorded native species of mammal on the island, varied and contradictory interpretations of its classification to subgenus or species-group have been proffered since its description. We review here those opinions to clearly frame the taxonomic background for the current study. Mailliard (1924) described P. slevini based on 1 individual. He contrasted his new species only with the similarly sized P. californicus and assigned it to the subgenus Haplomylomys. His narrow comparisons and consequent subgeneric assignment were influenced by members of the United States Biological Survey, in particular E. A. Goldman, to whom he sent the specimen for identification (E. W. Nelson, in litt.; as per Mailliard 1924:954): ''It belongs to the subgenus Haplomylomys and is most closely allied to Peromyscus californicus, but differs so decidedly that he [E. A. Goldman] regards it as specifically distinct.'' Curiously, Mailliard (1924) did not mention Osgood's (1909) authoritative and then recent revision of the genus. Burt (1934) disputed the subgeneric allocation of P. slevini based on study of 52 specimens that he personally had collected in 1931. Burt (1934:159-160) recommended that ''this species was not a member of the subgenus Haplomylomys, but, instead of the subgenus Peromyscus as defined by Osgood in his revision of the genus . . . .'' The distinguishing subgeneric features emphasized by Osgood (1904 Osgood ( , 1909 involve the incidence of accessory enamel crests and tubercles on the upper 1st and 2nd molars and the number of mammary pairs. According to these, and Burt's (1934:160) own emerging appreciation of bacular characters (''shows no close relationships between slevini and californicus''), he (1934:160) concluded that ''Peromyscus slevini seems to be an aberrant type that has no doubt been derived from some mainland species of the subgenus Peromyscus.'' Beyond these statements, Burt provided no evaluation of relationships of P. slevini within the subgenus or speculated on its species-group membership. The subsequent linkage of P. slevini with the P. maniculatus species-group likely stems from his (1934:160) comment that ''the general outline of the skull is more like that of Peromyscus maniculatus than that of P. californicus.'' Other than a very general comparison of cranial shape, using P. maniculatus and P. californicus as exemplars of their respective subgenera, Burt intended no species-group relationship or assignment by this remark, as is evident when read in the full context of his 1934 paper and from his conclusions quoted above. Moreover, in his later survey of the bacula of North American mammals, Burt (1960:53) reiterated his notion of affinity just to the rank of subgenus: ''Relationships with members of the subgenus Peromyscus are indicated.'' He did not offer bacular comparisons between P. slevini and other Peromyscus or imply any lower-level assignment, for example, as he did regarding P. sejugis, on",

Neither Mailliard (1924) nor Burt (1934) mentioned this distinctive supraorbital expansion, but Mailliard clearly illustrated it in his line drawing (1924:955) of the type specimen's skull. The lateral edges of the shelf in P. slevini are not reflected dorsally to form a marginal bead as observed in certain species of the subgenus Peromyscus, such as P. megalops, P. stirtoni, or P. winkelmanni (Carleton 1977; Huckaby 1980 ). However, a basically flat supraorbital shelf, without lateral beading, does characterize other species of the subgenus Peromyscus, notably those of the aztecus, melanophrys, and mexicanus groups (sensu Carleton 1989 ). Among these, shelf development in P. slevini closely resembles that of species of the melanophrys group (Osgood 1909 (Osgood , 1945 , and in particular approximates the interorbital condition observed in the smaller-bodied subspecies of P. melanophrys, P. melanophrys micropus (Fig. 1) . In marked contrast, the cranium of P. fraterculus, and of species of Haplomylomys in general (Osgood 1909) , lacks a supraorbital shelf. The interorbital region has a smoothly contoured, hourglasslike shape, a conformation also exhibited by those vouchers analyzed by Hafner et al. (2001) and identified as P. slevini (Fig. 1) . Burt (1934) , in applying Osgood's (1909) criteria, emphasized 2 qualitative characters in his reassignment of P. slevini to the subgenus Peromyscus: occurrence of accessory enamel crests on the M1 and M2 and the presence of 6 mammary glands. Our observations reinforce those of Burt.",

                "text": "We noted a short or long mesoloph on the M1 in about onehalf of the P. slevini collected by Burt and a fully formed mesoloph on the M2 in nearly all specimens, a constancy remarked by Burt (1934) . Mailliard (1924:956) referred to ''the cusplet in the posterior reentrant angle of the second upper molar,'' which suggests the presence of an M2 mesoloph in the type of P. slevini, a condition verified by TEL's examination. Compared with many species of the subgenus Peromyscus, the molars of P. slevini, as well as P. melanophrys (Hooper 1957) , are much simpler, especially the m1 and m2, which typically lack mesolophids and ectolophids; neither kind of lophid occurs in the sample of P. slevini. Mesolophs, mesolophids, and ectolophids are commonly found in species of the aztecus, mexicanus, and truei groups (Hoffmeister 1951; Hooper 1957) , although those enamel structures may be short and incompletely developed in certain populations. Also, no M1 anteroloph was observed in our samples of P. slevini and P. melanophrys; this is a regular enamel feature found in most aztecus-and mexicanusgroup species. A mesoloph (''enamel loop'' per Osgood [1909] ) rarely occurs in examples of P. fraterculus, and if present consists of a rudimentary spur from the central mure of the molars. The usual absence of a mesoloph, as well as other lophs and lophids, in P. fraterculus agrees with Hooper's (1957) more rigorously substantiated findings for species of Haplomylomys (P. californicus and P. eremicus sensu lato). Among the voucher specimens cited in recent studies of P. slevini, those used by Hafner et al. (2001) lack a mesoloph, in conformity to P. fraterculus; those reported by Smith et al. (2000) variably possess a mesoloph on the M1 and uniformly contain one on the M2, as characteristic of P. slevini. Osgood (1904) in part based his new subgenus Haplomylomys on the possession of 4 mammae, distributed as 2 inguinal pairs. This teat number and anatomical pattern characterize our samples of P. fraterculus and the voucher specimens used by Burt (1934) ; B) example of a small-bodied P. melanophrys, P. m. micropus (USNM 511692, male from Mexico, Nayarit, Mesa del Nayar, 4,500 ft; ONL \u00bc 29.8 mm); C) voucher (CIB 704, male from Mexico, Baja California Sur, Santa Catalina Island; ONL \u00bc 24.0 mm) identified as P. slevini by Hafner et al. (2001) ; D) P. fraterculus (USNM 555231, male from Mexico, Baja California Sur, southeast side Bahia Concepcion; ONL \u00bc 23.9 mm). Hafner et al. (2001-confirmed on specimens CIB 705, 711, 714 , and 715, females that obviously had been nursing). In contrast, most species in the subgenus Peromyscus, including P. slevini (confirmed on specimens UCLA 50218 and 50219, and USNM 287999) and P. melanophrys, also possess an anterior (postaxial) pair, totaling 6 teats. Although unreported by Osgood, the occurrence of the postaxial pair varies within the subgenus Peromyscus; in particular, species of the megalops and mexicanus groups lack postaxial mammae (Huckaby 1980) . Phallic comparisons.-Phalli from deer mice vouchers retained by Hafner et al. (2001) and Smith et al. (2000) are markedly different. Those removed from the 1st sample (Hafner et al. 2001 ) match the anatomy of the baculum and glans penis described for the P. eremicus group (Burt 1960; Hooper 1958; Hooper and Musser 1964; Lawlor 1971b) . The glans penis is simple, short, and stout, and its truncate distal end lacks lappets or a protrusible tip. The baculum is correspondingly short, weakly curved dorsally, and has a relatively broad, squared base (BL: X \u00bc 8.4, range \u00bc 7.9-9.1; BW: X \u00bc 1.8, range \u00bc 1.7-1.9); a minute, diffuse bit of cartilage caps the distal tip. The short and broad bacular dimensions associate the 3 specimens of Hafner et al. (2001) with examples of P. fraterculus proper (Fig.  2) . By contrast, the 3 phalli obtained from the 2nd sample (Smith et al. 2000) are elongate and narrow; each possesses an extensible tip and 2 dorsal lappets at the base of the tip. The bacular shaft is long and slightly curved, and its base small and rounded (BL: X \u00bc 11.5, range \u00bc 11.1-12.3; BW: X \u00bc 1.4, range \u00bc 1.4-1.5); it terminates in a small but distinct cap of cartilage. The longer, narrower bacular proportions of the vouchers of Smith et al. (2000) group them among specimens of P. slevini proper (BL: X \u00bc 11.4, range \u00bc 9.6-13.0, n \u00bc 21; Fig. 2 ). The conformational and mensural features of the baculum and glans penis in P. slevini sensu stricto (including the 3 vouchers of Smith et al. [2000] ) are consistent with those described for species of the P. melanophrys group (Burt 1960; Hooper 1958; Hooper and Musser 1964) . The baculum of P. melanophrys actually is longer and more strongly bowed along its length, especially toward the tip (BL: X \u00bc 14.7, range \u00bc 11.8-16.2, n \u00bc 19; Fig. 2 ). That of P. perfulvus is intermediate in degree of curvature and length (BL: X \u00bc 12.7, range \u00bc 11.7-14.1, n \u00bc 7), marginally overlapping the bivariate constellations of both P. slevini and P. melanophrys as figured (not plotted to avoid visual congestion). The cap of cartilage tipping the baculum in all 3 is minute (no lanceolate tip as in the P. maniculatus group or P. pectoralis). On bacular shape alone, P. slevini, along with P. melanophrys and P. perfulvus, accords with Hooper's (1958) earlier and broader recognition of a boylii group, which also included species now assigned to the truei, boylii, and mexicanus groups.",

These fundamental traits, as in the case of the long and slender baculum, generally associate the 3 with species of the truei, boylii, and mexicanus groups (Bradley and Schmidly 1987; Carleton 1977; Hooper 1958; Huckaby 1980 ). Because of inadequate preservation, nothing can be said about the nature or coverage of spines in P. slevini, other than that they appear to be present. The ventral lip of the urinary meatus in P. slevini is even and unmarked by a ventral lappet, that is a free, usually triangular-shaped, extension of the glans body that projects distally from the meatus margin (e.g., as per P. maniculatusand most P. boylii-group species). Nor is a ventral lappet clearly developed in either P. melanophrys or P. perfulvus in this narrower morphological sense, although Hooper (1958) seemed to use the term ventral lip as synonymous with ventral lappet. Dorsal lappets are present in P. slevini, formed as a medial, close-set pair with minor folds or indentations of the glans body at their sides. Interestingly, this condition of the dorsal rim of the glans body appears similar to that of P. melanophrys and P. perfulvus, insofar as can be ascertained with the imperfect material at hand.",

The uniformly large and positive correlations of variables with the 1st factor extracted, whether principal component or canonical variate (Table 2) , indicate that size differences largely account for the spread of samples along this axis, effectively segregating P. fraterculus and the vouchers of Hafner et al. (2001) from P. slevini, P. melanophrys, and the vouchers of Smith et al. (2000) . Dispersion of specimen scores along the 2nd factor principally reflects the larger size of certain dimensions measured on the neurocranium (variables BBC, BOC, and IOB) and inflation of the auditory bullae (LAB). Such variables especially influence the morphometric isolation of samples of P. melanophrys from that of P. slevini proper ( Fig. 3 ; Table 2 ).

Specimens used in the genetic and karyotypic studies of Hogan et al. (1997) and Smith et al. (2000) , respectively, conform to the morphology of P. slevini proper, as represented by Mailliard's (1924) holotype and by the large series obtained 10 years later by Burt (1934) . However, those used in the molecular study of Hafner et al. (2001) have close affinity to P. fraterculus, indeed as the mitochondrial sequencing data of these authors convincingly demonstrated. Correct allocation of P. slevini to the subgenus Peromyscus was long ago resolved by Burt (1934) , and we can only second his character evaluations and taxonomic recommendation. The recent affiliation of the species with the subgenus Haplomylomys (Hafner et al. 2001 ) was based on incorrect attribution of the analytical samples from Santa Catalina Island to P. slevini. In a sense, Mailliard's (1924) original classification of P. slevini in Haplomylomys also was a misattribution, or at least a misunderstanding of character variation of Peromyscus based on misleading advice he received from personnel of the Biological Survey, USNM. In retrospect, the evidentiary bases for past associations of P. slevini with Haplomylomys and with the californicus or eremicus species-groups were never soundly founded.",

Peromyscus slevini best fits with Mexican species that have been arranged in the P. melanophrys group (\u00bc P. melanophrys, P. mekisturus, and P. perfulvus), as its contents originally were denoted by Osgood (1909) and as its morphological features and member species were later amplified by others (Hooper 1955 (Hooper , 1957 (Hooper , 1958 (Hooper , 1968 Hooper and Musser 1964) . Principal similarities include upperparts with penetrant tawny or ochraceous tones, particularly along the flanks; tail moderately hairy, forming a terminal pencil; interorbital region with nonbeaded supraorbital shelf; general aspects of cranial size and shape; variable presence and weak development of the mesoloph in the upper molars, and absence of lophids in the lowers; and a long, slender phallus with protrusible tip and dorsal lappets. To be sure, none of these traits is unique (autapomorphic) within the subgenus Peromyscus, but taken together they indicate relationship with species of the melanophrys group, a working hypothesis that is as reasonable as any of its other past species-group affiliations.",

The acrocentric condition of chromosome 2 in P. slevini, interpreted as a primitive condition for the genus sensu lato (Greenbaum and Baker 1978; Greenbaum et al. 1994) , contrasts with melanophrys-group species in the same way that it does with mexicanus-group species, to which group Smith et al. (2000) preferentially associated it. Stangl and Baker (1984) cladistically depicted P. melanophrys and P. perfulvus in an unresolved polytomy that included mexicanus-group species (and P. pectoralis), a kinship supported by pericentric inversions of chromosomes 3 and 9, derivations that characterize many Peromyscus species (Rogers et al. 1984) . Karyotypic segregation of the 2 as a definable species-group rested on the autapomorphic possession of the tiny Y chromosome. In summary, if the karyotypic differences are insufficient to exclude P. slevini from the mexicanus species-group, the ''phylogenetic association'' postulated by Smith et al. 2000, we see them as no more compelling for excluding the Santa Catalina species from the melanophrys group, especially in view of the many morphological resemblances enumerated above.",

                "text": "Although the assignment of P. slevini to the melanophrys group may be defended given the current arrangement of Peromyscus species-groups (e.g., Carleton 1989), we readily acknowledge that it lacks a quantitative phyletic perspective. In part, this lack reflects the general shortcoming inherent in the historical formation of species-groups within the genus, emerging as gestalt associations that were loosely based on overall similarities in pelage texture and color, size, dentition, and cranial form. Osgood (1900:12) vaguely used the speciesgroup rank ''in order to show the affinities of the species,'' but he was inexplicit about his meaning of affinity or the characters he considered important to assess the same (except as can be sometimes gleaned a posteriori from reading his species accounts). Hooper (1968:28) , followed by Carleton (1989:118) , explicitly intended morphological resemblance to operationally define a species-group as ''an assemblage of similar species within a subgenus,'' and supposed that such phenetic similarity indicated community of descent. He, and others, of course had broadened the morphological character base consulted in understanding supraspecific relationships within Peromyscus, in particular by using traits of the phallus (Burt 1960; Hooper 1958; Hooper and Musser 1964) and systematization of dental variation (Hooper 1957) . Only within the past 2 decades have investigators emphasized phylogenetic diagnosis of species-groups and sought to improve the empirical basis for inferring the common ancestry of member species (e.g., Bradley and Schmidly 1987; Hafner et al. 2001; Hogan et al. 1997; Riddle et al. 2000; Rogers et al. 1984; Stangl and Baker 1984; Sullivan et al. 1997; Tiemann-Boege et al. 2000) . In light of these current research emphases, it is worth noting that most (not all) of Osgood's (1909) species groupings have so far survived this reinvigorated scrutiny, conducted with far greater analytical precision and more rigorous methodological approaches than heretofore possible. Whatever his inchoate sense of ''affinity,'' Osgood's practical application must have subliminally incorporated a strong phylogenetic component.",

In addition to species of the mexicanus or boylii groups, those of the melanophrys group, as argued here, also should be considered as possible close relatives. Two phylogenetic interpretations merit testing. By virtue of its acrocentric chromosome 2 and normal Y chromosome, P. slevini may have been isolated on Santa Catalina Island from a melanophrys-group stock before the formation of the mainland species, P. melanophrys and P. perfulvus (also see biogeographic comments below). Alternatively, as suggested by Smith et al. (2000) , the cladistic origin of P. slevini may have preceded the radiation of the many Peromyscus species that exhibit inversions of chromosomes 3 and 9 (see Rogers et al. 1984; Stangl and Baker 1984) . A broader taxonomic scope and other information sources must be marshaled to tease apart these phylogenetic hypotheses or to identify yet others. The species-group membership of P. slevini might be legitimately left as incertae sedis, especially in light of the karyotypic findings of Smith et al. (2000) , but we formally allocate it to the melanophrys assemblage to emphasize its closest morphological similarity within the genus and to make refutation of this taxonomic hypothesis straightforward.",

As indicated by the direction of univariate mean differences and relative dispersion on the 1st principal component extracted (Fig. 3) , the Santa Catalina population averages slightly smaller than those of P. fraterculus, about 96-97% of its size as indexed by mean occipitonasal length. Size diminution in this insular population of P. fraterculus departs from the usual pattern among Sea of Cortez Peromyscus, wherein island representatives tend toward larger size (Lawlor 1982; Lawlor et al. 2002) . Still, the slight disparity is within a magnitude of difference that can be plausibly attributed to ecophysiological factors understood to influence the evolution of rodent size on islands (see summary by Lawlor et al. [2002:352-354] ). The profound size and qualitative character changes necessary to evolve P. slevini proper from a P. fraterculus-like progenitor is less convincingly arguable (e.g., Hafner et al. 2001:787) .",

Thus, land-bridge islands on opposite sides of the Sea of Cortez typically contain populations whose closest relatives are found on immediately adjacent continental areas: peninsular Baja California for populations on western islands and mainland Mexico (e.g., Sonora, Sinaloa) for those on eastern islands (Lawlor et al. 2002) . Species of the P. eremicus group, which populate many islands on both sides of the Sea of Cortez, exemplify the land-bridge island pattern. Populations or species isolated on western islands share relationships with peninsular forms, P. eva or P. fraterculus, whereas those on eastern islands demonstrate affinities with mainland P. eremicus (Hafner et al. 2001) . Lawlor (1983) suggested that such a pattern of geographic proximity also prevailed for derivative populations on oceanic islands, but our study and others (e.g., Hafner et al. 2001) indicate that it does not, at least for Peromyscus. Instead, most Peromyscus on oceanic islands are linked more closely to populations in mainland Mexico irrespective of an island's nearness to peninsular Baja California (Table 3) . This pattern involves several Peromyscus clades (species or species-groups) and predominates even though 12 of 14 oceanic islands are today physically closest to the peninsula. A particularly striking example is the presence of P. eremicus avius on Cerralvo Island, located just 9 km off the southeastern tip of Baja California but 120 km from the nearest point on the Mexican mainland. Notwithstanding its geographic proximity to the peninsula, this taxon is most closely related to mainland P. eremicus (Hafner et al. 2001) , not the nearby species P. eva and P. fraterculus.",

The discovery of P. cf. fraterculus on Santa Catalina is another instance that departs from the general oceanic-island pattern, although we cannot rule out the possibility that these mice were introduced recently to the island (see ''Conservation concerns,'' below). The phylogenetic relationships of the remaining insular populations-P. guardia on the midriff island Angel de la Guarda and its satellites (related to P. eremicus or P. fraterculus) and P. sejugis on San Diego and Santa Cruz islands (related to P. maniculatus)-are insufficiently known to plausibly localize biogeographic origins.

Nor do those of Sea of Cortez reptiles, whose biogeographic relationships are overwhelmingly closest to populations on adjacent landmasses irrespective of island type (Murphy and Aguirre-L\u00e9on 2002) . Although populations of Chaetodipus and Neotoma occur on fewer oceanic islands, their distributional alignment instead resembles that for mammals on land-bridge islands. However, drawing broad biogeographic contrasts based on insular representatives of these genera must be tempered because their taxonomy and phylogeny are less well understood than are those of island Peromyscus. Ancestral forms of species-groups within Peromyscus, Neotoma, and Chaetodipus all plausibly occurred within continental areas subjected to geological changes that formed the Sea of Cortez in the late Miocene-Pliocene and would have had stochastically equal access to gulf islands over geologic time. Perhaps species of Peromyscus are better overwater colonists than are those of Neotoma and Chaetodipus, a capability suggested by the presence of Peromyscus, but not the other rodent genera, on recently formed volcanic islands such as Tortuga.",

The island is composed of granitic basement rocks thought to share a geological origin with the southernmost Cape region, which was situated approximate to the Nayarit-Jalisco coast in the late Miocene (Carre\u00f1o and Helenes 2002) .

To our knowledge, only 2 collections of P. slevini proper have been secured since the discovery of the insular species in 1921 (Mailliard 1924 )-the large series obtained by Burt in December 1931 (Burt 1934 ) and a smaller sample by personnel of the Texas Cooperative Wildlife Collections in January 1992 (Hogan et al. 1997; Smith et al. 2000) . The CIB specimens of P. fraterculus were captured just 3 years later, in October 1995 (Hafner et al. 2001) . If both species have long cohabited Santa Catalina Island, then Burt and TCWC personnel failed to trap any P. fraterculus along with their series of P. slevini, and the CIB field team missed the latter species in 1995 and only collected the former. Or perhaps a post-1992 introduction of P. fraterculus has ecologically supplanted endemic P. slevini, but 3 years seems too short a time for interference competition to propel this outcome, for example, as has been suggested for the competitive extinction of P. pembertoni by P. boylii on San Pedro Nolasco (Alvarez-Casta\u00f1eda and Ortega-Rubio 2003; Lawlor 1971b Lawlor , 1983 .

The International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (1996) currently lists P. slevini as critically endangered, an assessment that reflects its single known geographic occurrence and its inherently limited habitat in a small insular setting. The recent documentation of domestic cats on Santa Catalina portends a more immediate and lethal threat to its survival (Alvarez-Casta\u00f1eda and Ortega-Rubio 2003; Lawlor et al. 2002) .

Compared with P. melanophrys, P. slevini averages paler ochraceous, does not possess as dense a concentration of darker hairs over the middle dorsum, and is less gray around the rostrum, eyes, and face. P. melanophrys does vary in the degree of its dorsal saturation (Osgood 1909) , from dark to pale, with the palest of these approaching P. slevini. Compared with the bright tawny to cinnamon tones of P. perfulvus (Osgood 1945) , specimens of P. slevini are much paler and subdued dorsally. In P. slevini, tips of ventral hairs are creamy white, not obscuring the dark gray bases; general effect of the underparts is medium gray, somewhat resembling P. perfulvus but darker on average than grayish white of P. melanophrys. As noted for the holotype (Mailliard 1924) , most specimens of P. slevini possess a pectoral streak of pale cinnamon hairs, a marking consistently present in certain races of P. melanophrys. Tops of the metatarsals and ankles are whitish in P. slevini, in contrast to the dark ankles and dusky hind feet that characterize P. melanophrys and P. perfulvus.",

However, many individuals of P. melanophrys have a wholly white terminal section, not found in P. slevini, and the tail in P. perfulvus is dark and nearly unicolor from its base to tip (Osgood 1945) . In P. slevini, the caudal hairs themselves are moderately dense and long, imparting a hairy appearance upon gross inspection; its caudal pilosity resembles the condition observed in P. perfulvus but is slightly denser than that in P. melanophrys. The caudal hairs terminate as a slight pencil that projects beyond the terminal vertebrae; the degree of penicillation more or less matches P. perfulvus but slightly surpasses that in P. melanophrys, although Osgood (1909) did not mention a pencil.",
