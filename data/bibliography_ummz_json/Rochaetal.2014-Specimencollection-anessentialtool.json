It also found that a number of rare species are in fact common. Voucher specimens are essential and, again agreeing with L.A.",

Letter \"Specimen collection: An essential tool\" (23 May, 344: 814) brilliantly discuss the importance of specimen collection and present the evolution of collecting since the mid-19th century until our present strict codes and conducts. However, it is also important to emphasize the fact that the vast majority of deep ocean macro-organisms are only known to us because of collection and this is a strong argument that should be present in our actions as scientists. If the deep is considered the least known of Earth's habitats (1% or so according to recent estimates)",
