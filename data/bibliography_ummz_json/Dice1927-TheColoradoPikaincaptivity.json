                "text": "During the third week of July, 1926, three pikas (Ochotona princeps sa:rat-ilis) were trapped alive at Willow Park, in Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado. All were taken at an elevation of about 10,600 feet, or about 500 feet below timberline. I found it not difficult to trap pikas alive in a trap having wire screen tops and sides. The traps were set on the rock slides at places pikas had been seen to frequent, or where fresh sign was abundant, and no success was had in setting traps at random on the rock slides. The most effective bait was green willow leaves, and the animals seemed not at all attracted to rolled oats or other common 'rodent baits. Altogether I trapped four pikas alive in these traps in a few days on small rock slides where the animals were not at all common. However, rain storms in the late evening or night killed two of these animals after their capture before I could visit the traps. Another very young pika, about one-quarter grown, was caught by one leg in a snap mouse-trap set by a log in the Engelmann spruce forest about forty meters from the nearest edge of a rock slide. The broken leg was amputated and the pika survived.",

In January and February the pikas became almost entirely gray in color, with hardly a trace of the summer buffy tints. About March 1 they began to change again to the summer color. In this spring molt a buffy tinge was first noticed on the frontal region of the head and along the sides of the body. In neither fall nor spring molts was there any sudden change of color, nor any sharp molt line, but the pelage seemed to be replaced by a few hairs at a time.",

They seemed to behave peacefully at first, but one morning it was found that the male had torn all the hair off the back of the female, the skin of her back being bitten and scratched all over. They were immediately separated, and after a time the female recovered and grew a new coat of hair. The female proved not to be pregnant. Later some attempts were made to mate the female with the young male, now fully mature, but at each attempt the female attacked him with such vigor that they had to be separated to save his life. No success, therefore, was obtained in breeding these pikas in captivity.",

However, it is possible that a mother and her last brood of young might remain together during the winter.",

Occasionally one would escape by making a sudden dash around the cage while the door was open for feeding them; but its getting through the open door seemed to be an accident, and the animal would tumble headlong to the floor, a distance of two to four feet. They never seemed to be injured by these falls. They were easily recaptured by being driven toward a live trap set along a wall. They never learned to avoid a trap, but would plunge completely through and always bump their nose on the rear wall. This makes me doubt if their eyesight is very keen.",

As the animals were kept in a room fully open to the outside air it is probable that the cage temperatures were closely similar to those recorded by the Weather Bureau station on a nearby building. This would seem to indicate that the pika is unable to endure high temperatures, and for this subspecies the maximum limit is probably under 95\u00b0. I have often noticed in the mountains that during clear, hot days the pikas are not active except in the evenings and mornings, when the temperatures are not very high on the rock slides. The fact that high temperatures are fatal to the pika does not necessarily' prevent the occurrence of the species in regions where high day temperatures occur, and, in fact, one subspecies, Ochotona schisticeps goldmani, occurs on the lava desert of Idaho. Here, however, the night temperatures are nearly always cool, and during the heat of the day the animals would be able to retire to cool caves under the rocks.",

The offer was accepted and a part of the herd, consisting of three head, was safely transported in crates by train and then by wagon from Stockholm to their destination, and set at large there. This was witnessed by natives from far and near and by several foreign notables, as well as Superintendent of Skansen, Mr. Behm, and General Consul Johnson.
