    "abstract": "In the absence of a substantial functional shift, morphological evolution is usually expected to follow an allometric trajectory, however, studies of tree squirrel jaws have found isometry across most of their size range. This isometry appears to reflect the integration of a small number of lever arm lengths that are critical for generating bite force. To test whether this integration constrains only the ratios of these lengths, or jaw shape in general, we analyzed jaw shapes and a set of lengths comparable to those used in previous studies for 23 species of sciurine tree squirrels (Sciurus, Tamiasciurus and Microsciurus), a lineage that is both functionally uniform and spans a large size range. We found that the measured lengths were highly correlated and isometric with respect to each other, but negatively allometric with respect to jaw size. Shape differences are generally small, but shape diversity was still greater than the diversity of mechanical advantages (input lever lengths scaled by output lever length). In addition, phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that only a minute fraction of shape evolution is correlated with size evolution. This contrast between the diversity of shape and the stability of proportions among a suite of functionally relevant lengths suggests that constraints on those lengths and the associated mechanical parameters have little or no ability to restrict changes in other aspects of jaw form.",

Tree squirrels would seem to be one of those functionally uniform groups, but some studies suggest that evolution of jaw morphology in tree squirrels is not allometric but rather is isometric over most of their size range (Ball and Roth 1995; Thorington and Darrow 1996; Velhagen and Roth 1997) . Most of the exceptions to the general isometry are at the extremes of the size range: pygmy squirrels (\\80 g), and giant squirrels ([2000 g ). Within the range of more typical species (100-1200 g), tree squirrels have a reputation for being morphologically uniform relative to other rodents, a uniformity that includes the anatomical position of jaw muscle attachments and the proportions of input and output lever arm lengths. The explanation for this uniformity might be particular to jaws or particular to squirrels.",

                "text": "Jaws of all animals may maintain isometric scaling of linear dimensions for purely mechanical reasons; allometric scaling is necessary only when functional features of different dimensionality must keep pace with each other. In one classic example of allometry, limb cross sections (areas) must keep pace with the mass they support (a function of volume); therefore the square root of area must increase faster than the cube root of mass. Jaw function is not so directly tied to the mass of the body; the jaws may be provisioning a larger body, but the requirement to eat more food does not necessarily translate to a requirement for larger foods. Carnivores can reduce the costs of hunting by eating larger prey, but herbivores derive no particular benefit from eating larger leaves. More important, the performance of jaws as levers for exerting force on food items may be determined by the ratios of just a few lever arm lengths (Davis 1955; Turnbull 1970; Bramble 1978; Greaves 1982) . Because the lengths that determine these ratios all have the same dimensionality, they should be expected to scale isometrically with respect to each other to maintain functional relationships such as their mechanical advantages. In fact, ratios of jaw lever arm lengths have been shown to be quite stable in several mammalian lineages that are ecologically and functionally distinct from tree squirrels (Radinsky 1982 (Radinsky , 1985 Greaves 2000) . Stability of these ratios produces a reliable correspondence between muscle force production and bite force, and thus a fairly direct link between a selective input (selection on bite force) and an evolutionary output (change in muscle mass). This could, in turn, permit diversification by size stratification and niche partitioning, as Radinsky (1982) suggested for mammalian carnivores. In addition, stability of these few ratios, by insuring a reliable response to selection on bite force, may free other aspects of jaw morphology to evolve independently of that same selective pressure, perhaps in response to other functional demands. Thus, conservation of lever arm ratios need not extend to other features of jaw shape.",

                "text": "In tree squirrels, uniformity of jaw lever arms may actually be associated with a general uniformity of jaw shape. In fact, tree squirrels appear to be highly conservative in nearly all their anatomical features, not just their jaws (Bryant 1945; Moore 1959; Black 1963; Emry and Thorington 1982) . Only such major functional and ecological shifts as the evolution of ground squirrels or flying squirrels have led to notable qualitative anatomical changes. The close similarity between extant species of Sciurus and forms found in the early Oligocene (\\30 mya) has earned Sciurus, and tree squirrels in general, a reputation as living fossils (Emry and Thorington 1984) . Such strong conservatism bespeaks a highly constrained morphology, one that might resist even the pressures of size scaling. The source of that conservatism may lie in the extraordinary functional demands of arboreality and durophagy. Durophagy places a premium on the ability to generate large bite forces to fracture hard foods (Werdelin 1989; Binder and Van Valkenburgh 2000; Herrel et al. 2002; Dumont et al. 2009) . Selection for rapid arboreal locomotion would not only favor eyes positioned to capture a complex threedimensional visual scene, but also a relatively large brain that can quickly process complex spatial data and manage the correspondingly complex locomotor demands (Lemen 1980; Eisenberg and Wilson 1981) . Because the bones that encompass the brain and eyes are also the attachment surfaces for the jaw muscles, the skull may have a limited ability to accommodate these two sets of demands (Dullemeijer 1958; Cartmill 1980; Roth 1996) . Limitations on skull morphology would entail corresponding limitations on the lower jaw, which must maintain effective occlusion.",

Recent comprehensive molecular analyses have demonstrated that this is a monophyletic group, corroborated several key branch points and established their ages (Mercer and Roth 2003; Steppan et al. 2004) , providing a framework for phylogenetic analyses of jaw size and shape. We described jaw morphology using both geometric shape variables and lever arm lengths comparable to those used in previous studies (Thorington and Darrow 1996; Velhagen and Roth 1997) . Comparison of these two data sets allowed us to corroborate the stability of the lever arm ratios, and evaluate the diversity of shapes within that constraint.",

Although the point is easily recognized on specimens in hand, and in properly lit 2D images, it is not a corner, but an extreme point on a broad curve in most of the taxa in this study. Thus we do not regard it as landmark in the strictest sense--as a discrete, anatomically defined point location that is comparable across specimens. Accordingly, we included SM2 in the lever arm lengths, but omitted its end point from the landmark set (however, the contribution of this projection to the shape of the angular process is captured by the semilandmarks following the ventral edge of that process).",

Biochemical differences among North American species are small and not consistently nested among taxa, suggesting a recent radiation within a narrow time interval. Because more precise dating is not available, divergence events along the main stem were approximately evenly spaced within this interval. Similarly, branching events for South American taxa that were not analyzed by Mercer and Roth are evenly spaced between dates established for the taxa that they did include. The resulting tree ( Fig. 2a ) was used in computation of independent contrasts and in estimation of hypothetical ancestral shapes. To guard against making inferences that were dependent on poorly supported estimates of branching patterns and divergence times, analyses were repeated using a second, partially randomized tree (Fig. 2b) . In this second tree, the strongly supported nodes form the backbone and a random number generator determined the sequence of branching events for the remaining taxa.

All lengths except the longer superficial masseter arm (SM2) exhibit a slight but statistically significant negative allometry relative to jaw centroid size. This result suggests that some linear dimensions of the jaw are changing length relatively faster than those represented by the lever arm Averages of the measured lengths (Appendix Table 8 ) were log transformed prior to performing the regression analysis. S.E. is the standard error of the estimated slope. 95% CI is the 95% confidence interval around the slope. P = 1 is the probability that the slope is equal to one, based on t-tests using the absolute value of (1 -slope), S.E., and 21 degrees of freedom lengths. Because the dorso-ventral thickness of the ramus and diastema is not well represented by the lever arm lengths, we infer that this dimension has a slight positive allometry relative to the measured lengths. This pattern would be consistent with production of larger forces in larger animals. The plots of muscle input arm lengths against incisor output arm length demonstrate that the smallest species in this study do not deviate from the isometry exhibited by larger species (Fig. 3) . The smallest species here are the two Microsciurus species, which have body weights around 80 g. Although they are distinctly larger than most other dwarf and pygmy squirrels, they are still much smaller than the next smallest species in this study, 200 g Tamiasciurus. Even so, it is the Tamiasciurus species that have much shorter than expected values for T1. Several other species have comparably low values for T1, suggesting the value in Tamiasciurus does not reflect a size related trend, but the generally greater variability of this length. The largest species in this study, S. spadiceus, is one of the species with a relatively short T1, and it also has shorter than expected lengths for SM1 and SM2. This combination of deviations from the general pattern of relative lever arm lengths may indicate an important functional or ecological shift in the evolution of S. spadiceus.",

Contrasts were standardized using the branching pattern and branch lengths shown in Fig. 2a had a regression that accounted for a higher fraction of the shape variation (P 10,000 = 0.0001). The axis of shape change that is correlated with size change predicts that smaller jaws will have a relatively long condyloid process with a proportionately large condyle, a slightly reduced coronoid process, a more posterior and relatively square angular process, relatively short and more sharply curved diastema, and a masseteric fossa that extends more anteriorly under the cheek teeth (Fig. 5a) . The converse will be true of larger jaw sizes (Fig. 5b) . The biplot of scores on this shape axis against centroid size (Fig. 5c ) has a much more elliptical distribution than might be expected for a regression that explains\\1/4 of the variation in the dependent variable. However, the variable plotted in the graph, and illustrated by the deformations, does not represent all of the shape variation in the data set. It only represents the trajectory through the shapes that is most highly correlated with size. The positions of the taxa along this trajectory are not perfectly correlated with size, only 60% of the variation in scores is explained by variation in size. That fraction of the variation in scores represents 22% of the variation in shape.",

The diastema and incisor are expected to be thinner than in large jaws, but less so than when Microsciurus were included in the data. Also, when Microsciurus are excluded, the inferred allometry does not include extension of the masseteric fossa under the molars in small squirrels, and the angular process does not change position with size. There is a thinning of the angular process as the curve between angular and condyloid processes is deeper in smaller squirrels. In addition, the tip of the coronoid process is extended posteriorly, giving it a more hooked shape in smaller squirrels. More important than the difference between the two patterns is the smaller amount of shape diversity that can attributed to allometry: although still highly significant (P 10,000 = 0.0185), this correlation accounts for only 11% of the shape variation in these taxa.

Consequently, the regression accounts for only 25% of the variation in shape contrasts.

Each specimen was classified based on a classification constructed from the scores of the other 208 specimens (treating that one as an unknown). Each row indicates the results for the specimens originally identified as a member of that species. The diagonal shows the number of correctly classified specimens; other positions indicate the numbers that were misclassified and the species to which they would be assigned if they were unknowns. The last column gives the percentage correctly classified for that species. For example, 5 of 6 M. flaviventer specimens were correctly identified (83%), and one would be incorrectly identified as M. alfari divergent evolutionary directions taken by sister taxa are particularly evident for species at the ends of long terminal branches (Fig. 11 ). For example, S. aberti (Fig. 11a ) differs from the ancestor it shares with S. griseus in having a taller and more hooked coronoid process and a thinner proximal condyloid process (i.e., thinner near the joint). S. aberti also has a somewhat elongate horizontal ramus and a posteriorly placed angular process. Its sister species, S. griseus, is inferred to have diverged from their most recent common ancestor in the opposite direction ( Fig. 11b) . A more striking example can be seen in the divergences of S. igniventris and S. spadiceus from their common ancestor, which differ in both magnitude and direction ( Fig. 11c, d ). M. flaviventer also has diverged farther than S. ignitus from their common ancestor (Fig. 11e, f) , but more notable, these two clearly exhibit different combinations of localized changes. The posterior tip of the condyloid process is elongated in both, but the coronoid is transformed in opposite directions (shortening in M. flaviventer, elongating in S. ignitus), and some regions are transformed in only one species (the angular and distal condyloid in M. flaviventer, the posterior diastema and anterior tooth row in S. ignitus). M. alfari and S. granatensis provide another example of sister species with different combinations of localized divergence from their common ancestor (Fig. 11g, h ). It is also evident that the dwarf species M. flaviventer and M. alfari diverge in different directions from their respective common ancestors (cf. Fig. 11e, g ), and converge on a common form only in shortening the tip of the coronoid and elongating the condyloid. When shape evolves in such a great diversity of directions, there can be little correspondence between the evolution of shape and the evolution of size.",

And like Velhagen and Roth, we found that the masseter moment arms were isometric relative to the output arms, but the temporalis arms were negatively allometric. These results indicate mechanical properties of the tree squirrel jaw are extremely stable, as Radinsky (1982 Radinsky ( , 1985 found for several other mammalian lineages. In contrast to the lever arm ratios, evolution of jaw shape in these squirrels was much less restricted. The shape differences were small, consistent with the squirrels' reputation for conservatism, but they were not aligned along a single trajectory correlated with size. Once phylogenetic relationships were taken into account, it was clear that there was no meaningful correlation between the evolution of size and the evolution of shape. There is a statistically significant correlation, but it is mostly due to a small number of lineages with large transformations in both size and shape. Even in those few large contrasts, the amount of shape change that is correlated with the size change is a small fraction of the total. Furthermore, reconstruction of shape changes between nodes demonstrated that the lineages with the largest shape transformations evolved along several different trajectories, not just up and down a single one. Thus, despite the extremely consistent proportions of functionally important lengths, jaw shape evolved in a variety of directions, producing statistically significant differences in jaw shape.",

                "text": "The shape data also lead us ask what might be the value of conserving lever arm length ratios when so many other features of jaw shape are more labile. Given the mechanical principles elaborated previously (Davis 1955; Bramble 1978; Greaves 1982) , it may seem reasonable to suppose that there might be a special advantage to these particular values as they relate to the effectiveness of the jaw closing musculature. In fact, the tree squirrels' remarkable consistency may seem like an example of the many-to-one mapping of phenotypes to function discussed by Alfaro et al. (2004 Alfaro et al. ( , 2005 . However, the shape variation that exists within the apparent constraint of these length ratios suggests substantial differentiation in the forces borne by these jaws, which may indicate equally substantial differentiation in selection of food items. In addition, the consistency of relative lengths from the condyle to a muscle's attachment points do not necessarily equate to a consistent perpendicular distance from the condyle to that muscle's line of action (Bramble 1978) . The latter distance is the effective lever arm length, which determines the true mechanical advantage (also called 'mechanical potential' by Carraway and Verts 1994) . The shape data analyzed in this study suggest that positions of muscles relative to the condyle are shifting, and that these changes may be independent for anterior and posterior components of the muscles (as demonstrated by the base and tip of the coronoid process). Consequently, lines of action and effective lever arm Fig. 10 Evolutionary changes in a jaw centroid size and b shape. Branching pattern is the same as in Fig. 2a ; vertical distances are proportional to magnitudes of changes inferred by squared change optimization. For centroid size, black indicates size increases, gray indicates size decreases, and the vertical scale bar represents a change of 1 cm. For shape, branch lengths represent Procrustes distances between shapes inferred for adjacent nodes; the vertical scale bar is in units of Procrustes distance lengths may be undergoing much greater transformations than would be inferred from the distances of muscle attachment sites from the condyle. By extension, jaw mechanical properties and the loading regimes jaws experience may be more diverse than might be inferred from the stability of lever arm length ratios.",

                "text": "Despite their small magnitudes, the shape changes are also functionally important. For example, the two Microsciurus species and several of the other small taxa diverge from their larger relatives in having deeper curves between the posterior processes (coronoid, condyloid and angular). These deeper curves not only reduce the relative size of the area available for muscle attachment, they also result in a more slender and less tapered process that is less able to resist deformation than a thicker, more tapered process with a broader base. This pattern is consistent with the scaling of bite forces seen in some studies (Herrel et al. 2002; Herrel et al. 2005; Lemen 2008) . Smaller taxa have relatively smaller muscles that produce relatively smaller strains requiring less robust processes. Conversely, the greater dorso-ventral thickness of the ramus and diastema in taxa like S. spadiceus or both Tamiasciurus species is consistent with these animals generating proportionately larger forces to gnaw through harder objects than relatives and competitors. The functional significance of these changes is not immediately obvious because expanded muscle attachment areas of the coronoid and angular processes are consistent with both generating comparatively larger peak forces and greater differentiation of muscle activity patterns between anterior and posterior segments of the attached muscles. Greater differentiation would allow an animal to exert large forces at many different gape angles, or a sustained force through a large arc and over an extended period of time. The latter muscle activity pattern would be consistent with shaving long slivers off of a hard shell, like a carpenter planing a board, but either would help to explain how squirrels are able to gnaw through rinds, shells or cones that approach or exceed the diameters of their heads.",

Rather the shape data examined here serve as a warning that jaws exhibit more morphological diversity than is represented by an analysis of a few lever arm lengths. Even in taxa that have only recently radiated and have not undergone substantial ecological or functional transformations, shape differences can be both statistically significant and functionally relevant. In this regard, a more instructive analysis might be one that focuses on taxa that have diverged for a longer period of time or have undergone a larger ecological shift. However, squirrels have not just evolved from generalized to specialized; they have also shifted ecological types. Recent phylogenetic analyses (Harrison et al. 2003; Steppan et al. 2004; Herron et al. 2004) suggest that the transformations between arboreal durophage, terrestrial granivore and grazer may have occurred multiple times. These more substantial functional shifts may have more profound effects on how the anatomy and variation of the jaw are structured and integrated. ",
