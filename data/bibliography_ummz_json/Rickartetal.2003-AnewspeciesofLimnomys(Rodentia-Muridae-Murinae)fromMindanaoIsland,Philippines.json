    "abstract": "A new species of murine rodent is described from the Mt. Kitanglad Range of north-central Mindanao Island, Philippines. It is the 2nd known species of Limnomys, a genus endemic to Mindanao. The new species differs from Limnomys sibuanus in having a relatively longer tail, larger hind feet, softer pelage with grayish-white ventral coloration, larger skull with a longer rostrum, larger auditory bullae, larger molars, and other cranial and dental features. The new species apparently is nocturnal, omnivorous, and terrestrial-scansorial in habit. The 2 species of Limnomys have overlapping elevational ranges on Mt. Kitanglad and are known to occur syntopically at 1 locality. All 11 species of murines native to Mindanao occur in the Mt. Kitanglad range, and 2 are local endemics. The local occurrence of congeners in 4 genera suggests a repeated pattern of vicariance speciation and dispersal among highland areas of Mindanao.",

Apo located in the south-central portion of the Philippine island of Mindanao (Fig. 1) . Subsequently, additional specimens of Limnomys from Mt. Malindang in western Mindanao (Fig.  1 ) served as the basis for Hollister's (1913) description of L. mearnsi (later synonymized with L. sibuanus by Musser, 1977) . As was the case with Apomys, Bullimus, and Tarsomys, other genera superficially described by Mearns (1905) , Limnomys eventually was considered part of Rattus until its generic status was reestablished by Musser (1977) . The few known specimens of Limnomys were reexamined by Musser and Heaney (1992) , who rediagnosed the genus in detail.

Nasal bones are long with sloping sides that give the tip of the rostrum a slightly tubular appearance. Posterior portions of the nasals are depressed, forming a shallow concavity along the midline that continues caudad to include the anterior portion of the frontal bones (in L. sibuanus, posterior nasal and anterior frontal surfaces are flat). In both species, the posterior por- tion of the skull is strongly flexed downward, so that the occiput projects caudad beyond the occipital condyles and the foramen magnum is directed posteroventrad. In both species, the zygomatic plate is narrow, and the zygomatic notch is shallow. However, in L. bryophilus the plate is somewhat wider and the zygomatic spine projects further forward resulting in a slightly deeper zygomatic notch than seen in L. sibuanus. The dorsal root and anterior portion of the zygomatic arch are moderately broad. The squamosal root of the arch is positioned low on the side of the braincase, and its posterior shelf does not reach the lambdoidal ridge. The subsquamosal fenestra is absent. The mastoid is slightly inflated, with a prominent fenestrum near the dorsal margin and a foramen located in the suture with the occipital. The auditory bulla is large and inflated and is separated from the squamosal by a large postglenoid fora- men and from the alisphenoid by a narrow middle lacerate foramen. Compared to L. sibuanus, the new species has a much larger bulla and the postglenoid foramen and middle lacerate foramen are more prominent. In both species, the alisphenoid canal anterior to the bulla is completely open laterally (not concealed by a lateral strut of bone). The posterior opening of the canal is confluent with the foramen ovale, which is more prominent in L. bryophilus. An adjacent, much smaller foramen comprises the anterior canal opening.",

Lower incisors are narrow, and have convex anterior faces that wear to sharp awl-shaped tips. In size and form, the upper incisors of the new species are indistinguishable from those of L. sibuanus; however, the lower incisors are slightly more robust and have darker yellowish-orange enamel that extends further onto the lateral tooth surfaces. The molars of L. bryophilus (Fig. 6 ) are substantially larger than those of L. sibuanus, both absolutely and relative to the size of the palate and mandible (Table 2, Fig. 2A ), and are higher crowned. The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd upper molars have, respectively, 5, 4, and 3 roots. The 1st lower molar has 4 roots and the 2nd and 3rd lower molars each have 3. Molar crowns are moderately hypsodont, with cusps arranged in transverse laminae that are sharply inclined causing some overlap of adjacent teeth. Cusp patterns are similar in the 2 species of Limnomys ( Fig. 6; Musser 1994:34, figs. 2  and 3 ), but there are some subtle and consistent differences. On the 1st upper molar, both the anterior lamina (formed by cusps t1, t2, and t3) and the middle lamina (cusps t4, t5, and t6) are strongly bowed (i.e., lingual and labial cusps are prominently projected posterior to central cusp). In both species, the posterior lamina of the 1st upper molar (consisting of a large t8 and smaller t9) is comma-shaped. Both the 2nd and 3rd upper molars bear a large anterolingual cusp (t1) and 2 laminae that correspond to the middle and posterior laminae of the 1st molar. In L. bryophilus a small t3 is present on the 2nd molar, but most specimens lack this cusp on the 3rd molar; these features are more prominent or occur more frequently in L. sibuanus. In L. sibuanus, the 1st and 2nd upper molars have a prominent enamel wall on the posterolingual margin connecting cusps t4 and t8 (Musser and Heaney 1992:50, 52; figs. 25A, 27) . In contrast, L. bryophilus has a deep notch between these 2 cusps (Fig. 6) . The new species lacks posterior cingula on the upper molars, but posterior cingula are present in L. sibuanus. In both species, the anteroconid of the 1st lower molar consists of large anterolingual anterolabial cusps, and between these a smaller anterocentral cusp on the anterior margin (Fig. 6) . This anterocentral cusp is apparent in all specimens of L. bryophilus except old adults with muchworn crowns. A 2nd lamina (protoconid and metaconid) and 3rd lamina (hypoconid and entoconid) are strongly bowed. Other features include a small anterior labial cusplet (absent in some specimens), a large posterior labial cusplet, and a prominent posterior cingulum. The 2nd lower molar has a small anterolabial cusp, 2 laminae comparable to the 2nd and 3rd laminae of the 1st molar, a relatively large posterior la-bial cusplet, and a large posterior cingulum. The 3rd molar has a small anterolabial cusp, a straight anterior lamina and thick posterior lamina.",

Similar karyotypes of 2n \u03ed 42 are seen in most species of Rattus as well as members of Rattus-like genera throughout southern Asia and Indo-Australia (Rickart and Musser 1993) . In addition to the 2 species of Limnomys, other Philippine taxa with this arrangement include Bullimus bagobus, Rattus everetti, and Tarsomys apoensis .

The type locality at 2,250 m is located on a steep ridge on the northern flank of the Mt. Kitanglad range, in a transition zone between lower montane and upper montane (mossy) rain forest habitat (sensu Whitmore 1984) . Dominant trees at this locality include several species of gymnosperms and laurels (Lauraceae). Forest canopy is 7-10 m high and broken by many tree falls. Breastheight trunk diameters of canopy trees are 8-30 cm. Emergent trees are 12-15 m high on the main ridge and 14-18 m on hillsides, with breast-height diameters of 40-100 cm. Tree size declines progressively with increasing elevation. Abundant epiphytes include moss, lichen, ferns, and orchids. Un-derstory plants include broadleaf saplings, Rhododendron and other shrubs, Cyathea and other ferns, and sedges. Substrate consists of rocky, volcanic soil covered with a deep (10-50 cm) humus layer and thick surface leaf litter. On Mt. Dulang-dulang, habitat at 2,400 m is similar to that at the type locality. Between 2,700 and 2,800 m, the habitat is upper montane rain forest with a low (4 m) open canopy, emergent trees up to 10 m high, and breast-height trunk diameters of 10-15 cm. Epiphytes are abundant, principally consisting of thick layers of moss covering most upper branches and all lower limbs and trunks. The rocky, clay soil is covered with a thick humus layer and surface moss.",

T. apoensis and T. echinatus are locally allopatric with apparently disjunct elevational ranges (Heaney 2001; Musser 1994; Musser and Heaney 1992) , as are Crunomys melanius and C. suncoides (Rickart et al. 1998) . Members of each of these pairs of congeners are closely related and represent probable sister species (S. A. Jansa in litt. ; Musser 1982a; Musser and Heaney 1992; Rickart et al. 1998 ; S. J. Steppan in litt.). Their elevational distributions suggest a pattern of vicariance speciation across isolated highland areas of Mindanao ( Fig. 1) and subsequent dispersal by some taxa coincident with elevational shifts in vegetation accompanying long-term climatic changes (Heaney 1991) . A similar pattern is apparent among murids endemic to Luzon Island (Musser and Freeman 1981; Rickart and Heaney 1991; Rickart et al. 1998) .",
