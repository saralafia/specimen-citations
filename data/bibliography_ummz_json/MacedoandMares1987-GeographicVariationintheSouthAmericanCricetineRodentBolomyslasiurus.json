    "abstract": "Variation in cranial morphology of Bolomys lasiurus was examined using univariate and multivariate statistical procedures to evaluate approximately 1,000 specimens grouped into seven samples. Sexual dimorphism was found for 20 of the 24 characters analyzed, and the extent of dimorphism is similar throughout the range of the species. Principal components and cluster analyses indicated the presence of two distinct groups: (1) the northernmost Amazonian specimens and (2) significantly smaller specimens from other parts of the species' range. There are approximately 214 species and 46 genera (Honacki et aI., 1982) of South American muroid rodents. In diversity of species and number of individuals, these mice surpass all other mammals of the Neotropical Region (Hershkovitz, 1972), and have been partitioned into eight tribes. One of these, the Akodontini, encompasses a group of closely allied, short-tailed, volelike genera distributed throughout the grassy regions of South America (Hershkovitz, 1972); most are broadly omnivorous, with some species specialized for an insectivorous diet (Meserve, 1981; Pearson, 1983). Past and present difficulties in establishing boundaries for genera and species groupings have led to disagreement on the composition of this tribe. Lack of detailed study has prevented the construction of a stable taxonomy for South American muroids. Their fairly recent invasion of South America via the Panamanian land bridge (Mares, 1985; Patterson and Pascual, 1972; but see Hershkovitz [1972] and Reig [1984] for an alternative viewpoint) may have been followed by rapid phyletic differentiation and an explosive diversification of species (Bianchi et aI., 1971). These events may be largely responsible for presentday difficulties in the recognition of akodont species. In this study, we examine the akodont, Bolomys lasiurus, a small rodent having a tail much shorter than the total head and body length and a generally dark brown color (Avila-Pires, 1958). The ears are short and covered with hair the same color as the body (see Taxonomic History for detailed discussion of other characteristics). Bolomys lasiurus occurs in many habitats south of the Amazon (Hershkovitz, 1962), but is mainly found in the cerra do and the caatinga of central and northeastern Brazil. The cerra do is an endemic savanna complex that covers approximately 1.5 million km 2 of central Brazil. The occurrence of a predictable dry season characterizes the region (Eiten, 1972; loly, 1975). The semiarid caatinga of northeastern Brazil is characterized by drought-deciduous forests and dry plant formations, interspersed with thorn woodlands and thorn scrub (Sarmiento, 1975). Although widely distributed in the cerrado and caatinga of central and northeastern Brazil (Alho, 1982; Mares et aI., 1981), B. lasiurus also occurs in a variety of other areas, such as the Amazon and Atlantic Forest regions (Mares et aI., 1985), as well as in the chaco and the pantanal. The chaco is a deciduous xerophytic forest covered with formations of palms, savannas, and saline steppes (Alho, 1982); in contrast, the pantanal of southwestern Brazil is a seasonal marsh, dotted with cerrado-covered hummocks (Eiten, 1982). Geographic variation in B. lasiurus has not been examined. The objectives of this study are to define the nature and extent of geographic variation in B. lasiurus using a morphometric analysis, as well as to examine sexual dimorphism and individual variation among the populations. TAXONOMIC HISTORY Bolomys lasiurus at various times has been considered to be a member of Akodon (Ellerman, 1941), Zygodontomys (included by Hershkovitz, 1962, in the phyllotines), and Bolomys (Reig, 1978). Thomas (1910) listed lasiurus Lund under Zygodontomys. Osgood (1912, p. 52 as cited in Tate, 1932) wrote of Zygodontomys: \"Although formerly associated with Oryzomys the species of this genus seem to",

Individuals in age categories 2 and 4 were corrected to this standard through the addition or subtraction of differences existing between means for all characters, when compared to the means of age category 3. The correction for age should provide a good approximation, as it was not a strictly linear correction (i.e., the amount corrected for each character from age category 2 to 3 was not the same amount as that from category 4 to 3). The mean percent correction over all characters for age categories 2 (subadult) and 4 (old adult) was 5.6 and 3.2% , respectively. Thus, growth changes were assumed to occur at a more rapid rate during younger age categories than among older animals. This assumption has been borne out in many studies (e.g., Mello, 197Ba, 1978b; Villafane, 1981a Villafane, , 1981b . Extensively damaged specimens yielding fewer than 17 of the measurements also were excluded from the analyses. For missing values on other specimens (which comprised approximately 5% of our total measurements) linear regression on characters that explained the greatest amount of variance was utilized to estimate missing data (\"Missing Data Estimator\" program, Dennis M. Power). Thus, 53% of all specimens had all measurements available. Most specimens with missing characters usually lacked only one or two values (32%); only 6 specimens lacked 7 measurements.",

Subroutines from the Statistical Analysis System (SAS; Barr et a!., 1976) yielded standard statistics for male and female specimens. A two-way analysis of variance (ANOV A) was employed to indicate differences between males and females in each locality, and among geographic areas. The percentage difference between males and females was obtained by computing the difference between sexes for each character over all localities (males minus females), multiplying the difference by 100, and dividing the resulting value by the average of the male and female means. A similar computation for percentage differences was employed by Schnell et a!. (1985) in a study of sexual dimorphism in spotted dolphins (Stumella attenuata). A Duncan's Multiple Range test (Duncan test, PROC GLM from SAS) was used to indicate maximally nonsignificant subsets among geographic localities. NT-SYS programs developed by Rohlf et a!. (1982) were used on standardized data (i.e., character means = 0, character variances = 1) to generate a matrix of average taxonomic distance coefficients. The UPGMA (unweighted pair-group method using arithmetic averages) clustering method was employed to construct dendrograms of phenetic distance. These phenograms were then compared to the original matrices to compute the coefficient of cophenetic correlation, which reflects the accuracy of the similarity values in the phenogram in relation to those in the original similarity matrix (Sneath and Sokal, 1973) . The first three principal components were extracted from the correlation matrix among characters, and projections (based on standardized data) of the OTUs (population means) onto the principal component axes were plotted.",

A stepwise discriminant function analysis was used to identify those characters that best distinguished these three reference samples. Significant overlap among these samples was apparent in the results. The central Bolivian specimens were completely separated from the Amazonian ones, but overlapped greatly with all other remaining specimens. Thus, two well differentiated groups were defined: an Amazonian cluster; and a large division containing the remaining populations. A second stepwise discriminant function analysis (Fig. 5 ) was then used to discriminate maximally between these two groups: (1) the Amazonian cluster; (2) and all remaining samples, including those from central Bolivia and the caatinga. The resulting function for the males included 11 characters (Table 4) . The most useful character for differentiating between the Amazonian and the other specimens was palatal width at M3.

As a result, although sexual dimorphism patterns are suggested, they are not statistically demonstrated. The percentage differences for external measurements, based on Avila-Pires' (1958) data, ranged from approximately 2 for tail length to 8 for hindfoot length. These values were substantially larger than those for cranial characters. The percentage differences in cranial characters ranged from -4.5 for rostrum length (suggesting that the rostrum is elongate in females relative to males) to 4.1 for palatal foramina. Males in Avila-Pires' (1958) study were larger in 85% of the 13 characters reported. It is likely that his report of females being larger in 15% of the characters is simply due to small sample sizes; our study indicates that females are never on the average larger than males in skull measures.",

The discriminant function analysis for both sexes (Fig. 5 ) uses discriminant scores, calculated from a linear function of characters within each group, to emphasize differences between the two groups. In spite of the fact that discriminant scores overlap for Amazonian versus other samples, the discriminant characters used for both males and females provide considerable distinction between the groups. Future research may show that the Amazonian population is specifically distinct. Our data do not warrant such recognition at this time; however, in \u2022view of the data presented, we conclude that there are at least two morphometrically distinct groups of rodents included in B. lasiurus. Our results suggest that there may be no more than two, however. These include an Amazonian group, and a second one that comprises the remaining localities from the rest of the species' range. The subspecific name, Bolomys lasiurus !uscinus, originally used by Thomas (1897) , should be applied to northern populations in the proximity of the I1ha de Maraj6 and near the mouth of the Amazon River. The subspecific name Bolomys lasiurus lasiurus Lund, 1841 should be employed for the remaining populations. These two subspecific designations thus reflect cranial morphometric differences between a group of larger B. lasiurus restricted to the lowland rain forests south of the Amazon River, and remaining animals of smaller proportions from throughout the species' range. Our results indicate that the non-Amazonian samples are uniform regarding cranial morphology. Further research, however, using pelage, post-cranial morphology, karyology, etc., could bring to light differences unrelated to cranial morphology.",

With respect to environmental selective agents of possible importance, locality 1 is the sole sample from the humid region of the lowland rain forest. All remaining populations are from drier habitats, ranging from the semiarid caatinga of northeastern Brazil to the centrally located savannas of the chaco. The possibility of cranial morphology being the result of selection for some adaptive trait cannot be discarded. However, as several authors have pointed out (Mayr, 1963 ; Rohlf and Schnell, 1971) , isolation by distance, especially in the case of peripherally located populations, will often produce geographic variation as a result of reduced gene flow. Chance patterns brought about by stochastic factors might persist if the population, as is the case of the Amazonian group, is on the edge of the species' range.
