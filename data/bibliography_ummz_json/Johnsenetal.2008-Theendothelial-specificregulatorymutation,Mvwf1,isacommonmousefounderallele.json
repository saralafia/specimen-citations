    "abstract": "Mvwf1 is a cis-regulatory mutation previously identified in the RIIIS/J mouse strain that causes a unique tissue-specific switch in the expression of an N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase, B4GALNT2, from intestinal epithelium to vascular endothelium. Vascular B4galnt2 expression results in aberrant glycosylation of von Willebrand Factor (VWF) and accelerated VWF clearance from plasma. We now report that 13 inbred mouse strains share the Mvwf1 tissue-specific switch and low VWF phenotype, including five wild-derived strains. Genomic sequencing identified a highly conserved 97-kb Mvwf1 haplotype block shared by these strains that encompasses a 30-kb region of high nucleotide sequence divergence from C57BL6/J flanking B4galnt2 exon 1. The analysis of a series of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenes containing B4galnt2 derived from the RIIIS/J or C57BL6/J inbred mouse strains demonstrates that the corresponding sequences are sufficient to confer the vessel (RIIIS/J) or intestine (C57BL6/J)-specific expression patterns. Taken together, our data suggest that the region responsible for the Mvwf1 regulatory switch lies within an approximately 30-kb genomic interval upstream of the B4galnt2 gene. The observation that Mvwf1 is present in multiple wild-derived strains suggests that this locus may be retained in wild mouse populations due to positive selection. Similar selective pressures could contribute to the high prevalence of von Willebrand disease in humans.",

Endothelial cell expression of B4GALNT2 leads to aberrant post-translational modification of endothelial-derived von Willebrand Factor (VWF) with subterminal GalNAc residues, resulting in accelerated clearance and low circulating VWF levels. This unique regulatory mutation was termed Mvwf1, for Modifier of VWF 1 (Mohlke et al. 1999) .",

The physiologic function of the murine B4galnt2 gene and its human ortholog, B4GALNT2, are unknown (Montiel et al. 2003) , and B4galnt2 knockout animals are viable and have no discernable phenotype under laboratory conditions (Lowe and Marth 2003) . Several spontaneous mutations altering the tissue specificity of a given gene's expression have been reported, generally resulting in either a change in developmental timing (Crossley et al. 1992; Cunningham and Jane 1996) or a shift from a spatially restricted to a more generalized pattern of expression (Bedell et al. 1995; Duhl et al. 1994; Duttlinger et al. 1993 ). To our knowledge, Mvwf1 is the only reported example of a regulatory mutation resulting in a switch in gene expression program from one tissue-specific pattern to another restricted tissuespecific pattern.",

An approximately 30-kb region of greater than 2-3% single nucleotide divergence from C57BL6/J was identified that flanks B4galnt2 exon 1 (indicated in red in Fig. 1 ). In addition to single nucleotide differences (SNPs), this region also contains size variation in simple and complex tandem repeats as well as larger insertions and deletions. The net effect of these larger genomic changes decreases the size of the RIIIS/J upstream intergenic interval by 10 kb compared to C57BL6/J. Survey of mouse strains for the Mvwf1 allele and tissue-specific switch Ponder and Wilkinson (1983) previously described a switch in DBA lectin staining pattern from bowel to vessel similar to Mvwf1 in several inbred mouse strains, including the RIII strain from which RIIIS/J is descended. Thus, Mvwf1 may be present in inbred mouse strains other than RIIIS/J. DNA from 59 inbred strains ( Supplementary Table  1 ) was screened for the Mvwf1 allele using two size polymorphisms 5 and 10 kb upstream of B4galnt2 exon 1, including all available descendants of the strains described by Ponder et al. (1985) . Thirteen unrelated (Beck et al. 2000) inbred strains carrying the Mvwf1 allele were identified (Table 1) , including five independent wild-derived strains. The presence of the Mvwf1 allele in wild-derived strains suggests that Mvwf1 may also be present in wild mouse populations. Alternatively, accidental genetic contamination, which has been documented to occur between conventional inbred strains (Naggert et al. 1995) , could explain distribution of a single rare mutant allele among multiple laboratory strains. To test this hypothesis, DNA from recently established wild-derived outbred mouse colonies maintained by Dr. R. Miller at the University of Michigan Miller et al. 2002) was screened for the Mvwf1 allele. Mvwf1 polymorphisms were found in individuals from two distinct wild-derived M. m. domesticus colonies, implying that the Mvwf1 allele is present in the wild mouse populations from which these mice were derived.",

DBA lectin detects B4galnt2-specific subterminal GalNAc residues, as demonstrated by the absence of DBA lectin staining in any tissues from B4galnt2 knockout animals. All 13 Mvwf1 strains exhibited a vessel(+), bowel(-) DBA lectin staining pattern identical to RIIIS/J (Table 1) . A homozygote for the Mvwf1 allele from Dr. Miller's wild-derived colony also exhibited the RIIIS/J lectin staining pattern. A survey of plasma VWF antigen levels from nine Mvwf1 strains and three non-Mvwf1 wildderived strains (Table 1) found that the Mvwf1 strains have low VWF levels relative to the three non-Mvwf1 wildderived strains, consistent with a decrease in VWF level due to vascular endothelial B4galnt2 expression, as previously demonstrated for RIIIS/J (Mohlke et al. 1996) .",

Nine Mvwf1 strains and wildderived inbred strains from the M. musculus clade (Tucker 2007) , M. spretus, and M. spicilegus were included in this analysis. All nine of the Mvwf1 strains surveyed were found to share a unique, highly conserved common haplotype block spanning the entire region that was distinct from all other strains tested (represented in Fig. 2 ; amplicons with Mvwf1 SNPs are yellow; the haplotype block is outlined by the solid black box). Refinement of the haplotype data effort by sampling sequence from ten additional regions (5 upstream and 5 downstream) determined that the shared Mvwf1 haplotype block is approximately 97kb in length and encompasses the entire upstream intergenic region and most of the B4galnt2 structural gene. Seven of 20 non-Mvwf1 mouse strains surveyed were found to share two or more contiguous SNP blocks identical to the Mvwf1 haplotype (highlighted in the red boxes in Fig. 2 ), suggesting recombined alleles partially derived from the Mvwf1 founder allele. To determine if these shared regions affect B4galnt2 tissue-specific expression, DBA lectin staining was performed on bowel from strains representative of each candidate recombined haplotype pattern (Table 1) . MOLF/ EiJ (Strain ID #37) and Id12b (Strain ID #28) both exhibit a wild-type gut(+), vessel(-) pattern, suggesting that the genomic region responsible for the Mvwf1 tissue-specific switch in B4galnt2 gene expression program lies upstream of the B4galnt2 structural gene and proximal promoter region (boundary indicated in Fig. 2 by the black dashed line within the Mvwf1 haplotype block). DBA lectin staining was absent in both bowel and vessel in WSB/EiJ (Strain ID #64), suggesting the presence of an independent B4galtnt2 loss-of-function mutation on this allele. 1A) with inserts derived from either the C57BL6/J (intestine+) mouse strain or the RIIIS/J (vessel+) mouse strain was used to identify a minimal genomic interval that contains intestine-and/or vessel-specific regulatory elements. All three C57BL6/J BAC transgenes restored an intestinal DBA lectin staining pattern in B4galnt2-deficient animals ( Fig. 3 ), suggesting that the critical regulatory elements required for intestinal epithelial-specific expression are contained within the 84-kb overlapping region shared by the three BACs. Both RIIIS/J BAC transgenes Fig. 3 BAC transgenic bowel DBA lectin staining. DBA lectin staining of small bowel; positive lectin staining is brown. A Lectinstained bowel from C57BL6/J and F 1 transgenic animals generated with each of the C57BL6/J BACs (vessels are positive from the endogenous B4galnt2 gene; F 2 transgenic B4galnt2-/-animals exhibit staining in bowel but not vessels, while B4galnt2-/-animals exhibit no staining in any tissue, data not shown). B Lectin-stained bowel from transgenic animals generated with the two RIIIS/J BACs and a transgene negative (Tg-) littermate. The endogenous gene confers intestinal staining in all animals. Arrows indicate serosal blood vessels Supplementary Table 1 ). Colors were assigned to similar sequences based upon PAUP phylogeny trees; missing data are white. The B4galnt2 exon 1 boundary is highlighted by the thick white vertical line. The Mvwf1 haplotype block is outlined in black. Shorter segments in seven additional strains (28, 64, 37, 38, 40, 31, 20) have two or more contiguous amplicons with sequence identity to the Mvwf1 strains (outlined in the red boxes) restored a vascular expression pattern (Fig. 3 ), suggesting that the critical regulatory elements necessary for the vascular endothelial-specific expression program are contained within the 108-kb overlapping genomic region shared by these two BACs. Taken together, these data suggest that a master regulatory region may be localized to the genomic interval shared by these five BACs.",

                "text": "The inbred mouse strain RIIIS/J exhibits a tissue-specific switch in the expression of b1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase, or B4GALNT2, from the intestinal epithelial pattern seen in most mice to a vascular endothelial cellspecific pattern (Mohlke et al. 1999) . Examples of regulatory mutations in other genes have been previously reported, which change either temporal or spatial gene expression programs. Although large genomic rearrangements such as those resulting from chromosome translocations can also result in tissue-specific switches in gene expression programs by moving genes from their native genomic context to another differentially regulated locus, previous work (Mohlke et al. 1999) and our current data exclude such a large genomic rearrangement as a mechanism for the Mvwf1 switch. In humans, diseases such as hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (Cunningham and Jane 1996) can result from mutations that alter the timing of gene expression during development, although tissue specificity generally remains unchanged. Spontaneous mutations have been reported in mice that specifically decrease gene expression in the ''normal'' tissue while upregulating gene expression in other tissues, including examples such as the W-sash allele affecting c-kit (Duttlinger et al. 1993 ) and the Steel-contrasted allele of the melanocyte growth factor gene (Bedell et al. 1995) . However, in these cases the gene expression pattern has been changed from a restricted tissue-specific pattern to a more ubiquitous pattern of gene expression. In contrast, the Mvwf1 regulatory mutation results in a unique switch in gene expression program from one tissue-specific pattern to another entirely distinct tissue-specific expression program. Previous work demonstrated that Mvwf1 results from a cis-acting mutation (Mohlke et al. 1999 ) genetically localized to a large 264-kb genomic interval surrounding the B4galnt2 gene and containing nine flanking genes (Mohlke et al. 1996) . Although the use of alternative tissue-specific promoters has been described as a mechanism for regulating tissue-specific gene expression (Morishita et al. 1995) , 5 0 -RACE analysis appears to exclude this explanation for the Mvwf1 regulatory switch. Taken together, the BAC expression data and multiple-strain analyses reported here (summarized in Fig. 4 ) refine the candidate interval for the Mvwf1 regulatory mutation from the previous 264-kb genomic segment to a 30-kb intergenic region upstream of the B4galnt2 structural gene. These results position the candidate region for the Mvwf1 regulatory mutation well outside of the B4galnt2 structural gene and proximal promoter region and suggest that the Mvwf1 mutation alters the function of one or more enhancer and/or repressor elements acting over a large genomic distance.",

This degree of sequence divergence is 3-to 30-fold greater than the sequence difference expected between modern laboratory strains (Wade et al. 2002) . This 30-kb segment lies within a conserved 97-kb haplotype block shared by all 13 inbred mouse strains shown to exhibit the Mvwf1 switch in DBA lectin staining pattern from bowel to vessel first described by Ponder and Wilkinson (1983) . Our data identify the cause of the Mvwf1 tissue-specific switch in the B4galnt2 gene expression program (and the resulting low circulating VWF levels) as a single, highly conserved Mvwf1 founder allele that is common among inbred laboratory mouse strains. Six of these Mvwf1 strains were included in a survey of coagulation parameters as part of the Mouse Phenome Database project (Peters and Barker 2006) , accounting for six of the seven longest activated partial thromboplastin times (aPTTs) reported in the database (Fig. 5) . Thus, Mvwf1 is a common allele among inbred mouse strains and the major cause of a prolonged aPTT in laboratory mice.",

Although there are differences in the sizes of tandem repeats within this region between the Mvwf1 strains, Mvwf1 single nucleotide differences are nearly perfectly conserved. The conservation of single nucleotide differences is also shared by the wild-derived Mvwf1 mouse strains. The existence of this highly conserved region within M. m. domesticus could be the result of selection, of suppression of recombination, or of a founder event. Indeed, the presence of a genomic region of such high nucleotide divergence is suggestive of balancing selection at or near this locus (Charlesworth 2006) . Alternatively, this divergent segment could have arisen as the result of an introgression event from a closely related species such as other members of the genus Mus (Lundrigan et al. 2002) . There is evidence that fragments of genomic DNA can be exchanged between mammalian species, including M. spretus, which is sympatric with M. m. domesticus (Hardies et al. 2000; Orth et al. 2002) . A recently introduced foreign allele would be expected to have had less time to accrue sequence changes and could account for the large size of the Mvwf1 haplotype block. If the Mvwf1 divergent region is the result of an introgression event, then the species from which this allele was originally derived might also exhibit the phenotype conferred by the Mvwf1 regulatory mutation.",

Taken together, these data suggest the possibility that the Mvwf1 phenotype may confer a fitness advantage, resulting in selective pressure that accounts for the prevalence of the Mvwf1 allele in wild mouse populations. Even if additional evidence for natural selection can be obtained, the underlying mechanism may be difficult to precisely define. A direct effect of reduced plasma VWF (perhaps via decreased thrombotic risk) is one possibility. However, the responsible protein could also be any of the large number of other endothelial protein products (in addition to VWF) that are likely to be altered by Mvwf1. It is also possible that loss of GI epithelial B4galnt2 expression, rather than gain of endothelial expression, confers a fitness advantage in wild mouse populations. If the underlying explanation is indeed reduced plasma VWF, then similar positive selective pressures may have contributed to the high prevalence of von Willebrand disease in multiple mammalian species, including humans. in the initial screen), Dr. Richard Miller and Jessica Sewald at the",
