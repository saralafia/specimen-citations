Upper and lower first molars tend to be the least variable in the toothrow; the canines, incisors, and posteriormost molars tend to be more variable. Variability of the cheek teeth is uncorrelatecl with sequence of tooth eruption, but rather appears to be inversely related to occlusal complexity, with teeth in the carnassial region being the least variable. Correlations and partial correlations of tooth length were calculated for all pairs of upper and lower teeth. Surprisingly, the tooth pairs that are most highly correlated aTe in the premolar series where no tooth-to-tooth oceiusion is possible. Reduced variability near occluding camassials in each toothrow is presumably related to the functional importance of precise oceiusion, but this is not reflected in the pattern of correlations and partial correlations.",

However, relatively little attention has been directed to the variability of individual teeth in the dentition of mammals. Mammalian teeth are ideally suited for detailed evolutionary study because, with few exceptions, the teeth are fonned before they erupt and they do not continue to grow. Tooth size is highly correlated with body size (Gould, 1975) , and it has high heritability (Bader, 1965) . In addition, teeth are relatively abundant and well preserved in the fossil record, adding an important historical dimension to the study of mammalian evolution.",

Gingerich (1974) summarized data available on the variability of the cheek teeth in mammals. Primates have been relatively well studied (Gingerich and Schoeninger, 1979) , but dental variability in other orders is still poorly documented. In beginning a systematic revision of some Paleocene and Eocene fOSSil carnivores, we needed to know the nature of dental variability in modern Carnivora. Kurten (1966) published data on variation of tooth size in the spectacled bear, Tremarctos, but to date no one has studied patterns of variability in a large sample of a species with a carnassial dentition. For this reason we began the present study of variability in Vulpes vulpes. In addition to providing a standard for use by mammalian paleontologists, the results reported here are interesting in their own right in showing that low variability in the center of the cheek-tooth field corresponds to the functional center of most complex occlusion in this field.",

In addition to studying variation, we have also analyzed patterns of correlation in the dentition of V. vulpes. Unexpectedly, the most highly correlated elements of the dentition are non-occluding premolars. Regions of high correlation do not, in this case, correspond to regions of the dentition that would be identified as functionally important based on morphology and the pattern of variability. show how mesiodistal tooth measurements (length) were taken, and truncated line segments show how labiolinguaI tooth dimensions (width) were measured.",

The upper and lower first molars remain the center of a distinctive cheek-tooth field oflow variability. However, even with the contribution of sexual dimorphism factored out, upper and lower canines remain highly variable (mean CV == 7.0 and 6.8 for uppers and lowers, respectively). The upper incisors appear to constitute a distinct field of lower variability relative to the canines, but this pattern is not so clearly developed in the lower incisors. A similar pattern has been observed in the dentition of primates (Gingerich and Schoeninger, 1979) . Dental fields. -Butler (1939) made a detailed shtdy of the crown morphology of adjacent teeth in the mammalian dentition, and emphasized the integrated nature of the dentition. He proposed that dental development and evolution could be explained by the existence of three underlying morphogenetic fields of incisivization, caninization, and molarization-individual teeth are only parts of larger morphogenetic units. The pattern of variability of cheek teeth in V. vulpes corresponds to that expected for a morphogenetic or functional field of molarization including all the cheek teeth as part of a single unit (Van Valen, 1970) . However, incisor and canine fields in V. vulpes are morphologically distinct as well, and these fields are not clearly reflected by patterns of variability. Gingerich (1974) advanced two hypotheses to explain why upper and lower first molars tend to be the least variable in the cheek tooth series in mammals: 1) they are the first teeth to erupt in the permanent dentition, and thus they may be less affected by sexual dimorphism or other later ontogenetic factors affecting variability; 2) they occupy a central position in the toothrow, and may be bettcr integrated functionally and thus less variable. We examined the first hypothesis by calculating Spearman's rank correlation coefficient for variability and order of tooth eruption. Using the order of cheek-tooth eruption for V. vulpes reported by Slaughter et al. (1974) , and CVs from Table 2 , the rank correlation of variability and eruption is 0.029 for upper teeth and 0.055 for lower teeth. The probabilities of these values arising by chance are 0.72 and 1.00, respectively, affording no support for the hypothesis that variability is a function of the sequence in which teeth erupt.",

Rather, it appears that variability is measuring the relative complexity of functional occlusion. Central cheek teeth are least variable because they have the most complex occlusion. Canines are most variable, even after any effect of sexual dimorphism is factored out, because they have the simplest occlusion. Our current working hypothesis is that occlusal complexity is the chief constraint limiting variability in mammalian dentition. This hypothesis also explains patterns of variation observed in the primate dentition (Gingerich and Schoen inger, 1979) .",

These correlations between teeth should give a measure of the morphological integration of the dentition as a whole and of fields within it (Olson and Miller, 1958; Van Valen, 1962 Could and Garwood, 1969) . Table 4 shows that adjacent teeth tend to be more highly correlated (values along the main diagonals) than nonadjacent teeth (Pearson's 'rule of neighborhood'; Lewenz and Whiteley, 1902) . The most highly correlated teeth in the lower dentition of V. vulpes are P~-P.1-P4' and in the upper dentition p2_p. 1. Correlations (r) between adjacent teeth for these non-occluding premolars ranged from 0.82 to 0.86. For comparison, correlations (r) between adjacent teeth in the occluding incisor-canine series ranged from 0.42 to 0.66, and correlations between adjacent teeth in the occluding carnassial- molar series ranged from 0.15 to 0.50. A priori, one would expect teeth in an occluding series to be more highly correlated than non-occluding teeth, but this is not the case in V. vulpes. Correlations between upper and lower teeth are listed in Table 5 . Again, upper and lower teeth in opposing positions (values along the principal diagonal) tend to be highly correlated. The highest correlations are between the non-occluding premolars pZ_P2_p3, where r ranged from 0.80 to 0.83. Occluding incisors and canines have correlations ranging from 0.24 to 0.57, and occluding teeth in the carnassial region have correlations ranging from 0.46 to 0.76 (the highest figure being for M c P4, the carnassial pair).",

These two occluding regions are separated by the non-occluding premolar series. Analysis of the pattern of dental variation in V. vulpes shows that it corresponds reasonably well to these functionally delimited regions of the dentition. The carnassial series, where occlusion is most complex, shows the lowest variability. Occlusion in the carnassial series includes cusp-to-cusp puncturing occlusion, shearing occlusion, and some planar grinding occlusion. Incisor occlusion, involving only edge-to-edge occlusion, is less complex, and the incisors are correspondingly more variable in size.

The first upper and lower molars, having lowest variability and unimodal size distributions, appear to be the best teeth on which to base diagnoses in fossil carnivores with a carnassial dentition. Gordon (1977) proposed the same criterion for distinguishing the closely related bears Ursus americanus and U. arctos, so the approach appears to have general utility for diagnosing closely related species of carnivores as well as other mammals. As a rule, the range of variation of Ln (L x W) of Mr or Mr is about 0.35 to 0.40 in living mammals (both are 0.35 in V. vulpes, see Table 2 ), although mammals with highly specialized dentitions may not conform to this rule and they deserve separate study.",

An additional measure of functional organization in dentitions, \"morphological integration,\" is based on the actual correlations between tooth measurements. We expected to find the incisor-canine region of the dentition to be highly correlated and the carnassial-molar region to be highly correlated, with a valley of low integration in the premolar region in between. Surprisingly this is not the case, for teeth of the non-occluding premolar series show the highest correlations, a pattern that Kurten (1953) had previously shown (but not discussed) in European Vulpes. Partial correlations with respect to skull length show that the high level of integration of the premolar series is not a general factor detennined by overall size, but a group factor related to a \"morphogenetic\" field of some kind occupying the premolar region of the dentition.",

There may be some import;\"lllt function, as yet unknown, of non-occluding premolars in Vulpes that favors a high level of integration. On the other hand, correlations may not accurately reflect underlying functional importance. The relationship of variation to correlation, and the use of these as measures of morphological and functional integration deserve further investigation.",
