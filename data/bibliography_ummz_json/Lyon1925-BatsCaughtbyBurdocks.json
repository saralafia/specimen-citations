The head is of avellaneous tint or pinkish cinnamon, the back darker (from mikado brown to verona brown). The flanks sayal brown or tawny-olive.

C., where Sorex longirostris, Sore\u00bb fontinalis and Microsorex winnemana have been found, intervenes a region that seems in need of systematic trapping for long-tailed shrews. Accordingly I record, as a beginning, a specimen .of the masked shrew (Sorex cinereus) which, on November 25, 1924, entered one of my traps set in a sphagnum bog at the northern edge ofa wooded slope about 3 miles east of Newark, Delaware. Newark is 78 miles, following the line of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, from Laurel, Maryland, where Sore\u00bb fontinalishas been recorded (Bailey, Mammals of the District of Columbia).-MoRRIS M. \u2022GREEN, Ardmore, Pennsylvania.",

Little (Auk, vol. 42, p. 284, 1925) on birds, and incidentally .one.bat, being caught by burdocks recalls a similar occurrence with regard to bats which I saw in 1892. In an old abandoned structure known as Benham's Mill, Rock Island Arsenal, Illinois, numerous bats of a small brown species, probably /l-!yotislucifugus, used to find their abode. Near the mill was a large clump of burdocks. On one occasion I noticed at least a dozen bats of apparently the same species that lived in the mill caught by the burdock burs. They were quite dry and mummified by the summer sun. No birds were caught with them.c-Mxncos WARD LYON, JR., South Bend, Indiana.",
