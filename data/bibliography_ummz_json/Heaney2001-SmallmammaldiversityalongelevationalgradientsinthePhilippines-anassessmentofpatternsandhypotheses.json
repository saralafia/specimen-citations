    "abstract": "It is widely accepted that tropical lowland rain forest holds the greatest diversity of organisms, and it is often implied that this general pattern is also true for virtually all individual higherlevel taxa. Standardized elevational transect surveys of non-flying small mammals (Insectivora and Rodentia) on geologically old, speciesrich islands in the Philippines consistently show maximum diversity and relative abundance in upper montane/lower mossy forest at 1500-2200 m, often exceeding lowland species richness and relative abundance by a factor of three or more. 2 On mountains where maximum elevation exceeds 2000 m, there is a decline in species richness above about 1500-2000 m, yielding a curvilinear pattern of species richness along the elevational gradient. The peak in species richness occurs at the area of transition from montane to mossy forest, which is also the point at which rainfall probably peaks. In parallel with species richness, relative abundance of small mammals in the Philippines also increases from the lowlands to 1500-2200 m, increasing by a factor from two to 10. 3 Twelve hypotheses concerning patterns of diversity along elevational gradients, plus the null hypothesis, are evaluated. The null hypothesis of no variation and the hypotheses that maximum diversity is in the lowlands, that diversity is highest in areas of least perturbation, and that diversity increases with increasing area, are rejected. There is weak or ambiguous support for the hypotheses that diversity is greatest in areas of community interdigitation, that diversity is highest in the area of highest productivity, that diversity is correlated with habitat complexity, and that diversity is correlated with habitat diversity. There is strongest support for the hypotheses that diversity is correlated with annual rainfall, with total abundance of individuals in the community, with food resource diversity, with areas of reduced competition from other organisms, and with areas characterized by high rates of speciation. 4 Causality is difficult to evaluate because many hypotheses make non-exclusive predictions, they probably represent non-independent aspects of causal factors (in other words, there is much interaction among the processes highlighted by the various hypotheses), and they represent the range from proximate to ultimate and from descriptive to causal. All the hypotheses probably represent phenomena that exist in nature, but few (or none) represent phenomena found in all taxa. The primary challenge in the future will not be simply to accept or reject individual hypotheses, but rather to determine the circumstances under which the various causal factors are most important, how they interact, and how they can be combined into a more comprehensive and general multi-factorial model.",

Developing an understanding of that variation has played a central role in biology for a century and a half (e.g. Darwin, 1859; Wallace, 1878; Pianka, 1966; MacArthur, 1972; Cody & Diamond, 1975; Schall & Pianka, 1978; McCoy & Connor, 1980; Brown, 1988 Brown, , 1995 Ricklefs & Schluter, 1993; Rosenzweig, 1995; Brown & Lomolino, 1998) . In recent years, the need to document and understand patterns of biological diversity has taken on new urgency as the current threats to biological diversity have become more widely recognized (e.g. Soul\u00e9, 1986; Wilson, 1988; Gore, 1992; Myers, 1993; Quammen, 1996) .",

Much less attention has been given in recent years to variation in species richness in non-fragmented habitats, especially along elevational gradients, even though montane ecosystems usually support the highest local concentrations of species within a biotic region, especially in the tropics (Kikkawa & Williams, 1971; Terborgh, 1977; Beehler, 1981; Graham, 1983 Graham, , 1990 Heaney et al. , 1989; McCoy, 1990; Rahbek, 1995) . Almost the only generally recognized aspect of variation along elevational gradients has been the virtually axiomatic claim that lowland tropical forest holds the maximum level of biological diversity (e.g. MacArthur, 1972, p. 199; Brown & Gibson, 1983: 502; Whitmore, 1984, p. 259; papers in Wilson, 1988; Patterson et al. , 1996 Patterson et al. , , 1998 , although some authors have noted the paucity of reliable data about elevational patterns (Colwell & Hurtt, 1994; Rahbek, 1995 Rahbek, , 1997 Brown & Lomolino, 1998) .",

Our efforts to date with this poorly known fauna have focused on documenting general ecological and evolutionary patterns and on seeking potential explanations that can then be investigated in detail. In this process, we have found patterns of diversity that we did not anticipate, and these have impact on both conceptual models of evolutionary biogeography and on appropriate actions concerning the conservation of the fauna.",

It is not the purpose of this paper to review exhaustively all hypotheses of factors that influence patterns of diversity. Rather, its purpose is to use the data as an opportunity to review the range of available hypotheses, to point out briefly their conspicuous strengths and weaknesses, and to draw preliminary conclusions regarding the most likely factors that influence patterns of diversity within the organisms under study. As noted by Brown (1988 Brown ( , 2001 , Rahbek (1995 Rahbek ( , 1997 , Brown & Lomolino (1998) , and Lomolino (2000) , the hypotheses are quite diverse; some deal with proximate causes, others ultimate, some descriptive and some causal. The paper concludes with an evaluation of the utility of the hypotheses, with the intent of providing direction and focus for future research.",

The elevational range of each habitat type is determined by local conditions of mean annual temperature and precipitation (Frahm & Gradstein, 1991) . On tall mountains (>3000 m), lowland forest dominated by the tree family Dipterocarpaceae (dipterocarps) usually extends up to about 1200 -1600 m, where it grades into montane forest. Montane forest, usually dominated by Fagaceae (oaks), Lauraceae (cinnamon), Myrtaceae (myrtles) and Theaceae (camellias) extends from 1200 to 1600 m up to 1800-2400 m. Mossy or upper montane forest extends from its lower limit at about 1800-2400 m up to 2800-3000 m, and is dominated by Symplocaceae (alum tree relatives) and Myrsinaceae (ardisias); this zone then grades into subalpine forest, dominated by Ericaceae (heather and heath) and Myricaceae (bayberries) (2800 m to 3200 m) and subalpine scrub, usually dominated by Rhododendron and Vaccinium , from about 3200-3500 m (Whitmore, 1984; Ohsawa, 1990 Ohsawa, , 1991 Frahm & Gradstein, 1991) .

Bryophytes increase abruptly in montane forest (30-50 g/m 2 and 25-50% coverage), and increase sharply again at the lower edge of mossy forest (80-200 g/m 2 and 70-80% coverage), where they become a conspicuous part of the ground cover; in mossy forest, light intensity at ground level averages 20% of daylight.

Traps were baited late each afternoon with fresh fried coconut coated with peanut butter, or live earthworms. They were checked each morning soon after dawn and late each afternoon. Traps were placed 5-10 m apart; most (95%) were placed on the ground, but about 5% were placed above ground on fallen trees, horizontal branches or large vines. Individual Heaney, 1986) . traps were placed in lines of 20-40, and were left in place for 3 (usually) or 4 (rarely) days. Given lines were set at least 20 m apart, and given sites were sampled over the course of 8-18 days. Relative abundance of small mammals was estimated as the number of animals captured per 100 trap-nights, using 700-1900 trap-nights per site. Species-accumulation curves (Fig. 2) were used to determine the likelihood that all species had been sampled at given sites and transects (Heaney et al. , 1989 (Heaney et al. , , 1999 Rickart et al. , , 1993 . These species-accumulation curves indicate that, at any given site, the relative species richness was apparent by about 500 trapnights. Almost all species had been captured by 750 trap-nights at the majority of sites where more extensive sampling (1200-1900 trap-nights) was conducted, so we used 750 trap-nights as our minimum sampling effort. The 1550 m site on Mt Isarog was exceptional in its long lagtime required to approach an asymptote, as well as in its unexpectedly low relative abundance and other features . We inferred the presence of a species at a given elevation on a transect when that species was present at higher and lower elevations along the transect; such inferences accounted for less than 5% of the totals reported here (Fig. 3) .",

Previous studies that have discussed mid-elevation (or mid-productivity) peaks in species richness have not included statistical analyses to document their claims of curvilinear relationships that peak at midelevations (e.g. McCoy, 1990; Parris et al. , 1992; Rosenzweig, 1992; Rosenzweig & Abramsky, 1993; Wood et al. , 1993; Olson, 1994; Rahbek, 1995) . I suspect that this is because analysis of curvilinear relationships is more fraught with difficulty than is linear regression analysis, especially when sample sizes are small, as is usually the case with transect studies. In this study the problem has been approached in a direct but somewhat simplistic fashion. For all relevant datasets, the relationship between species richness and elevation were evaluated by first using the LOWESS regression analysis procedure, which uses locally weighted sums of squares to identify the underlying trend in a dataset without requiring the specification of any given linear or polynomial model (Cleveland, 1979; Hintze, 1995) . If LOWESS analysis showed that a curvilinear relationship is present, polynomial regression was then used to determine the best fit among a first-order polynomial (i.e. linear; y = m x + b), a second-order (= quadratic) polynomial ( y = x 2 + m x + b) and a third-order (= cubic) polynomial ( y = x 3 + x 2 + m x + b) regression, where y = species richness, x = elevation, m = a variable describing the slope of the curve, and b = the y -intercept. The best fit was judged by comparison of the P -values and the r 2 values (Table 1 ; note that probability requirements are increasingly difficult to achieve with increasing polynomials).",

The distribution of the five native species at four sites ( Fig. 3c ; Table 1 ) shows no discernable pattern. The lack of pattern may be associated with the small number of species (which is correlated with the small size of the island), the low height of the mountain (1150 m) and the small number of sampling sites (four). Because of the small number of sites, there are too few degrees of freedom to permit either a LOWESS analysis or second-or third-order polynomial regression analyses. Species richness on Mt Isarog, southern Luzon, has been described in detail by and Heaney et al . (1999) . The distribution of the eight native species at six sites (Fig. 3b) shows a progressive increase in species richness with increasing elevation, with a slight drop at the top. LOWESS analysis showed this pattern clearly ( Fig. 5b) . Although a linear regression of elevation and species richness was significant ( r 2 = 0.75, P = 0.03), a third-order polynomial provided a substantially better fit ( r 2 = 0.99, P = 0.02; Table 1 ). The overall pattern ( Fig. 3b ) is one of maximum diversity (all species present) near the top of the mountain (peak at 1966 m), with progressive attenuation with declining elevation. Species appear to fall into two groups: elevational generalists that are present at nearly all sites (three species) and highland species (five species) that do not occur below 1000 m, which is the transition area between lowland and montane forest .",

Roughly three species are lowland species (1600 m and below), two are montane specialists (roughly 1600-2250 m), four are mossy forest specialists (from 1800 m or more to near the peak), three are elevational generalists (from near sea level to near the peak) and two are montane and mossy forest generalists (1600 m to near the peak). There is much variation, however, and it is apparent that there are no sharp elevational boundaries between communities when all Mindanao records are grouped in this fashion, as might be expected when geographically diverse records are combined. LOWESS analysis showed a clear curvilinear pattern (Fig. 5b ) that is very similar to that on Mt Kitanglad. The first-and secondorder regressions of species richness on elevation are not significant, but the third-order polynomial is significant (r 2 = 0.97; P = 0.04; Table 1 ). It should be noted that, relative to the transect data, this dataset has the advantage of including a larger number of records gathered over many years and thus probably represents a more general picture of patterns in the native Mindanao mammal fauna than do the transect data. Conversely, the general data set has the disadvantage of lumping together records from mountains with different heights, different amounts of rainfall and different levels of disturbance. This probably exaggerates the degree of overlap that actually exists between various species, and therefore inflates the estimates of total species richness at any given elevation.",

The mountain where the Leyte transect was conducted differs from the other two in having a maximum elevation of only ca. 1150 m. At the highest elevation, some aspects of mossy forest were present (heavy epiphyte load and thick organic soil), but temperatures were higher, tree height greater, and understorey vegetation less well developed than was the case in primary mossy forest on Luzon and Mindanao, and many elements of lowland forest were present: leaf size was larger than in typical mossy forest, and there was less development of the heavy moss layer that occurs typically above 1800 m in southern Luzon and above 2000 m on Mindanao (see descriptions in Heaney et al., 1989 Heaney et al., , 1999 Rickart et al., , 1993 .

This pattern is interpreted as providing some support for the hypothesis. When the summary data for all of Mindanao (Fig. 4) are considered, the same general pattern is evident: several species appear to be lowland species, several are mid-elevation species and several are high-elevation species. Maximum small mammal species richness occurs in the interval 1500 -2000 m where low, middle and high-elevation species all occur. However, most of the variation in species richness is due to the addition of species at middle and high elevation, rather than to interdigitation of two communities that are equal in richness, and there is gradual attenuation away from the elevation of maximum richness, rather than an abrupt shift from one small mammal community to another.

In general, temperatures declined during glacial episodes, causing elevational vegetation bands to move down to lower levels. On a shorter time scale, perturbations due to storms and earthquakes are probably common, but there is currently no reason to believe that the degree of disturbance is related to elevation. Thus, no clear prediction seems possible in this case, so no test can be made, and I suspect that this causal factor may not be relevant.

Moreover, several authors (Janzen, 1973; Janzen et al., 1976) have argued that net accumulation of production is highest at middle elevations. McCoy (1990) found a mid-elevation peak in both insect diversity and plant production along a transect in the southern Appalachian Mountains. Although he concluded that his data supported Janzen's hypothesis of a mid-elevation peak in productivity, he cautioned that the data were incomplete and tentative. Additionally, Tilman (1982) , Owen (1990) , and Rosenzweig (1992 Rosenzweig ( , 1995 Rosenzweig & Abramsky, 1993) have argued that the relationship between productivity and diversity is typically curvilinear, peaking somewhere near the mid-point of measurable levels experienced by the taxon or community under study.",

Alternatively, if productivity peaks at middle elevations, as proposed by Janzen (1973) and tentatively supported by McCoy (1990) and Rahbek (1995) , then the hypothesis is supported by data presented here. The ambiguity about the elevational pattern of productivity poses a serious problem, however, and I conclude that support for the hypothesis must be regarded as ambiguous.

The prediction for Leyte is rejected (where there is no significant variation), but is accepted for the other cases. In other words, on islands where there is an elevational gradient that exceeds about 1800 m, the pattern of small mammal species richness is correlated with the amount of rainfall at any given elevation. I conclude that there is strong support for the hypothesis.

When data from all three transects are lumped, the correlation is significant (see Results); the correlation is not significant for the Leyte or Luzon transects taken separately, but is significant for the Mindanao transect taken separately. The correlation between abundance and species richness specifically predicted by the hypothesis (Fig. 7) is significant when all transects are lumped, but only the Mindanao transect shows a significant correlation when considered individually. I interpret these analyses as representing moderately strong support for the hypothesis. There is a consistent tendency for species richness in Philippine small mammal communities to be correlated with overall relative abundance in any given community: when the total number of individuals increases the number of species increases. H 8 : diversity increases with increasing resource diversity Discussions of differences in levels of biotic diversity often make mention of the possible impact of changes in the diversity of resources (especially food) that the organisms may use. This hypothesis is closely related to the hypothesis (H 5 ) that diversity is controlled by productivity (which in turn is related to H 6 concerning rainfall). In this case, the hypothesis focuses on that portion of the total productivity that is (or can be) used by a given set of species. Graham (1990), for example, argued that fruit and insect abundance probably decrease with increasing elevation in the Peruvian Andes, causing decreasing diversity and abundance of frugivorous and insectivorous birds and bats. Unfortunately, such discussions can easily become circular, because the presence of important resources may be identified only by the fact that the animals are using them, and use of the resources may then be used to explain the presence of the animals.",

In general, earthworms on high tropical mountains are scarce in the lowlands, increase somewhat in montane forest, are most abundant in mossy forest and decline in abundance as one progresses upward to the alpine zone (Collins, 1980; Fragoso & La velle, 1992) . We found a significant increase in earthworm abundance with increasing elevation at our Luzon site (rank correlation, r s = 1.0, P < 0.05; , with highest densities at 1350-1550 m (Fig. 8) . Several of the species of rodents at the Luzon site (Archboldomys luzonensis, Chrotomys gonzalesi, Rhynchomys isarogensis) feed heavily on such animals , and we have evidence of an equivalent set of vermivorous species at the Mindanao transect site. As shown in Figs 7 and 8 , the sites where earthworms are abundant have substantially higher levels of species richness than those where earthworms were scarce or virtually absent. The increase in species richness of small mammals is found even when relative density is held constant; in other words, addition of a certain food resource results in an increase in species richness, even if there is no increase in relative abundance.",

                "text": "On this basis, I consider the hypothesis to be supported, but again emphasize the problem with identifying resources a priori and the potential for circularity in definitions. However, there is a further potential problem as well. It is clear that earthworms and other soft-bodied soil invertebrates are most abundant in areas with large amounts of organic matter in the soil, moderate temperatures and high rainfall (Fragoso & La velle, 1992) . On tropical mountains, it is declining temperatures that cause the production of large amounts of rain at middle elevations, and the combination of high rainfall and cool temperatures that result in the development of mossy forest. Thus, this hypothesis may be a result of the variation in rainfall and temperature discussed in H 6 above, i.e. a correlate of one of the proximate manifestations of the phenomenon that is described in that hypothesis, and thus not an independent hypothesis. H 9 : diversity increases with increasing habitat complexity This hypothesis is most often associated with MacArthur (1964 MacArthur ( , 1972 , usually refers to structural complexity (including foliage height diversity) and/or microhabitat diversity, and is often cited as a prime factor associated with variation in diversity (e.g. Karr & Roth, 1971; Patterson et al., 1989; Rahbek, 1995) , although Terborgh (1977) and Rosenzweig (1992) have suggested that the correlation may be either spurious or inadequate as a sole explanation. Unfortunately, this hypothesis often suffers in application from the same problems with circularity that were mentioned above: often only those aspects of habitat complexity that pertain to the study organism are measured, and this may yield a biased estimate of the total environmental complexity (Rosenzweig, 1992: 722) . In the case of South-east Asian small mammals, I would be reluctant to argue that lowland forest has less structural complexity than mossy forest, or vice versa. Both are highly complex, although in very different ways. In lowland forest, much of the structural complexity is in the canopy, and some is associated with the high total plant diversity with the attendant diversity in growth forms. In mossy forest most structural diversity is on the ground, where high plant diversity and extremely complex soil stratigraphy (often 2-5 m deep) provides a heterogeneous environment. Soil conditions in the lowlands are simpler than in the mossy forest, and canopy complexity is much lower in the mossy forest than in the lowlands. For tropical small mammals that live on the ground, it is not surprising that it is possible to define more habitat complexity in mossy forest than in lowland rain forest (e.g. Heaney et al., 1989; Patterson et al., 1989; .",

In the case of the Philippine Islands, the major natural habitat types are lowland, montane and mossy forest ( pine savanna, limestone forest and ultrabasic forest are present in other regions that we have not sampled).

Thus, this hypothesis is not independent of several of the hypotheses discussed above.

We noted early in our studies that the frequency with which ants consumed the bait in our small mammal traps was near 100% in lowland forest, near zero in mossy forest, and that the frequency varied in a progressive fashion between the two extremes (Heaney & Rickart, unpublished data) . Data from the southern Luzon transect show that ant species richness and relative abundance are highest at the bottom of the transect and decrease steadily with increasing elevation (Samson et al., 1997) , and a similar pattern has been noted on Borneo (Collins, 1980) and in Costa Rica (Olson, 1994) . Ants are usually the first organisms to find and consume bait in the lowlands throughout the Philippines, and small mammal density is high only in places where ants are rare or absent. It has been suggested that arthropod competitors and prey species of ants exhibit increased abundance at high elevations because of the greatly reduced abundance of ants in cool, moist forest (Janzen, 1973; Stork & Brendell, 1990) . The hypotheses that ants and mammals compete for food resources, and that ants are the superior competitors when present, has been supported in recent studies in northern Borneo by Md. Nor (1997) .",

For example, there are at least four cases in which species found in highland regions in southern Luzon have their closest relatives in the mountains of northern Luzon (Musser & Freeman, 1981; Rickart et al., 1998) . The mossy forest in which these species are now found is limited to the tops of mountains, and so they exist as isolated patches. However, during the periods of glacial advance in the Pleistocene, cooler conditions and lowered sea level allowed mossy forest habitat to descend in elevation throughout much of South-east Asia, so that the currently isolated populations probably were contiguous during those periods. Subsequent warming resulted in habitat shifts upward in elevation (Heaney, 1991a) , and consequently led to genetic isolation and speciation (Musser & Freeman, 1981; Heaney & Rickart, 1990; Rickart et al., 1998) . Species that live in the lowlands have not been isolated in this manner, and so had reduced opportunity for speciation. Thus, speciation on Luzon has been most frequent in high-elevation areas, where today the levels of species richness are highest. In other areas, over-water colonization has also contributed to speciation, so that vicariance of highland habitats should be viewed as one of several important processes that have contributed to speciation in Philippine small mammals (Heaney, 1986 (Heaney, , 1991b Heaney & Rickart, 1990) , not the sole process.",

When maximum elevation is about 2000 m, only the increase phase of the curve is clearly evident. When the mountain peak is 1200 m or less, there is virtually no variation in species richness. Variation in species richness appears to be more strongly associated with the vegetation type at a given site than with elevation per se.

Current data sets on Philippine mammals lack information on relative abundance above 2250 m, but based on the strength of the curvilinear species richness pattern, I predict that future studies will find a decline in abundance that parallels the decline at upper elevations in species richness. The existence of these patterns would best be tested in places that have few species in common with southern Luzon and Mindanao, i.e. samples that are independent of our observations reported here. Such places in the Philippines would include northern Luzon (which has a fauna fairly distinct from that of southern Luzon), Mindoro and Palawan. Elsewhere in tropical Asia, transect studies on high mountains on Sulawesi, in Indochina and along the southern front of the Himalayas would be especially interesting because of their distinctive faunas. A preliminary analysis of rodents from New Guinea found a pronounced mid-elevation peak at ca. 1800 m (Rahbek, 1995) . A detailed, standardized transect on Mt Kinabalu, Borneo showed a pronounced mid-elevation peak in species richness (Md. Nor, 2001) , and a similar pattern of relative density (Md. Nor, 1997) .",

This pattern has often been found in tropical leaf-litter and soil invertebrate communities at locations around the globe (Janzen, 1973; Janzen et al., 1976; Gagne, 1979; McCoy, 1990; Olson, 1994) . Studies of individual taxa have found similar patterns (Melastomataceae in Peru: Terborgh, 1977 ; ferns on Borneo: Parris et al., 1992 ; orchids on Borneo: Wood et al., 1993; Lepidoptera in Indo-Australia: Holloway et al., 1990; beetles on Sulawesi: Hammond, 1990; Stork & Brendell, 1990; Andean birds: Rahbek, 1997; non-volant small mammals: Md. Nor, 2001; Rickart, 2001; S\u00e1nchez-Cordero, 2001 ). Olson (1994) suggested that the failure of some surveys of tropical arthropod diversity to detect a mid-elevation peak is due to small sampling area, although he noted that current data are limited. McCoy (1990) also argued that different sampling regimes may determine the outcome of insect diversity surveys, a point also emphasized by Rahbek (1995) .",

Leaf-fall may be greatest in montane forests (Leigh, 1975) , and there is some evidence that tree species richness may be highest at intermediate elevations (Proctor et al., 1988; Heaney & Proctor, 1990 ). However, this remains controversial. Gentry (1982, 1988) showed strong evidence of a correlation between precipitation and species richness of all large (>2.5 cm) woodystemmed Neotropical plants; however, he also demonstrated a regular decline in species richness of these plants along the elevational gradient, and noted specifically the absence of a mid-elevation bulge along the Andean front from the lowlands to over 3000 m.",

                "text": "However, this simplistic approach would not do justice to the many studies that have found support for the given hypotheses. There undoubtedly are places where there is no significant variation along a given transect (H 0 ), as was the case along our Leyte transect, and there are many cases of declining diversity with increasing elevation among birds (Terborgh, 1977; Goodman & Gonzales, 1990; Graham, 1990; Hunter & Yonzon, 1993; Goodman, 1996) and bats (Graham, 1983; Heaney et al., 1989; Utzurrum, 1995; Patterson et al., 1996 Patterson et al., , 1998 and these cases are consistent with the hypotheses of declining area (H 4 ) and declining productivity (H 5 ). Increases in diversity associated with community interdigitation (H 2 ) are so well-known that the term 'ecotone' is nearly always associated with increased diversity, at least on a local scale (e.g. Ricklefs, 1979: 672; Brown & Gibson, 1983: 93) . Similar arguments could be advanced for the other hypotheses that were not supported in the case of Philippine small mammals. It would appear that all of the hypotheses presented here represent phenomena that are real in nature. The relevant issues are, first, which hypotheses help to understand a given instance (e.g. small mammals in the Philippines), and second, on what set of organisms and under what circumstances a given phenomenon (described by given hypothesis) has an evident impact. In other words, rather than focusing on accepting or rejecting simplistic, unifactorial hypotheses, we need to determine the circumstances under which the various causal factors are important, how they interact and how they can be combined in to a more comprehensive and general multi-factorial model (see also Brown, 1988; Rahbek, 1997) .",

Declining temperature permits organic detritus to accumulate faster than bacteria and invertebrates can break it down. Deep soil, high rainfall and moderate temperatures at middle elevations create optimal conditions for soft-bodied soil invertebrates. The decline in temperature and increasing rainfall create conditions that are unsuitable for ants, which are highly successful competitors under conditions of high temperature and moderate to low rainfall in the lowlands. The variation in temperature, rainfall and soil conditions create conditions that favour different groups of plants at various elevations, and these form moderately distinct types of vegetation along the elevational gradient, but grade into one another in some places. Terrestrial small mammals are able to use the deep, complex soil and litter layers for refuge, and encounter abundant soil invertebrates on which to feed. The abundance of this resource allows them to reach high densities, and allows them to specialize on food resources that are highly stable over time because of the stability of the climate, thus permitting many species to coexist. Global fluctuations in climate cause the conditions that characterize mossy forest to shift in elevation, causing expansion at some times and contraction and isolation at other times, resulting in many opportunities for speciation, relative to conditions in the lowlands.",

For other organisms, different scenarios would have to be drawn, but it is not the development of such scenarios that I argue for. Rather, I believe that the development of an explicit, testable multifactorial model is necessary, one that recognizes the existence of multiple causal factors operating at different scales among different groups of organisms. Such a model would have to recognize the fact that organisms differ in their ability to utilize various resources and in their response to various climatic parameters, and so each would be influenced differently at a given site with a given set of resource and climatic parameters. Thus, I concur strongly with the call by Lawton (1996) , Ricklefs & Schluter (1993) and Rahbek (1995 Rahbek ( , 1997 for synthesis, integration and recognition of the common ground that exists among all of the many hypotheses concerning patterns of biological diversity.",
