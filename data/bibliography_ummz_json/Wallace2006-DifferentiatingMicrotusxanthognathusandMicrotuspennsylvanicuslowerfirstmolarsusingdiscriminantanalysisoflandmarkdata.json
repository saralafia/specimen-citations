                "text": "Specific identification of Quaternary micromammals (with relatively well understood ecological requirements) is essential for interpreting paleoecological conditions and for recognizing biogeographical shifts based on fossil data. However, the identification of arvicoline (''microtine'') molars often is complicated by the lack of diagnostic characters between closely related species. Within the vole genus Microtus for example, classification of isolated teeth is difficult without a large sample (Bell and Mead 1998; Bell and Repenning 1999; Graham and Semken 1987; Guilday 1962; Hallberg et al. 1974; Martin 1968; Semken 1984; Smartt 1977; Zakrzewski 1985) . This is particularly problematic when dealing with fossil material because teeth typically separate from their alveoli and are recovered as isolated specimens. Formerly, such Microtus molars were identified (in part) based on the extant taxa endemic to the collection area (Martin 1968) or on the closest living species. Distant species were not considered, especially if their ranges were relatively small or restricted. However, the geographic distribution of many arvicoline species (with similar tooth morphology) was significantly different during the late Pleistocene than today. These range differences resulted in broad sympatric relationships between many currently (or nearly) allopatric species (''disharmonious'' faunas as summarized by Bell et al. [2004] ), further complicating classification. Moreover, studies such as those of Bell and Glennon (2003) or Bell and Repenning (1999) have shown that characters previously thought to be diagnostic are highly variable within Microtus.",

                "text": "Microtus pennsylvanicus (meadow vole) and M. xanthognathus (yellow-cheeked vole or taiga vole) exemplify some of problems inherent to the genus. Although they are currently sympatric over much of the range of M. xanthognathus, M. pennsylvanicus tolerates a much broader range of habitats, and consequently ranges significantly farther south, east, and west ( Fig. 1) . Moreover, traditional methods (e.g., length and width) for differentiating lower 1st molars (m1s) of these 2 taxa are unreliable (Schubert 2003) , particularly for large specimens of M. pennsylvanicus. Typically, m1s that measure less than 3.2 mm are considered M. pennsylvanicus and those that are equal to, or longer than, 3.2 mm are considered M. xanthognathus (Rhodes 1984; Semken and Wallace 2002) . However, this occlusal length cutoff has varied from as low as 3.1 mm (Rosenberg 1983) to as high as 3.4 mm (Foley 1984) , and one does not have to look far to find samples that negate any of these occlusal boundaries. For example, living individuals of M. pennsylvanicus on the central Great Plains (e.g., Nebraska) approach and often exceed the size of M. xanthognathus (Davis 1987 ). In addition, the m1s of Recent M. xanthognathus from Alaska and Quebec that I measured for this study have an average occlusal length of 3.16 mm ( Fig. 1 ; Appendix I). Moreover, 44 m1s found in an archaeological site from about AD 1200, the Schmidt site, in Howard County, Nebraska (Satorius-Fox 1982) , which I assume are from M. pennsylvanicus because this site lies within the present geographic distribution of the large ''morph'' M. pennsylvanicus, and because the teeth exhibit a suite of characters (described below) typically considered diagnostic of the species, exhibit an average occlusal length of 3.25 mm ( Fig. 1 ; Appendix I). All of these specimens would be misidentified using occlusal length only ( Fig. 1 ), suggesting that some fossil records of M. xanthognathus have been missed because of a failure to recognize small, likely young, individuals, and also that large specimens of M. pennsylvanicus have been misidentified as M. xanthognathus. Such taxonomic misidentifications have significant paleoecological and biogeographical implications.",

These southern populations of fossil M. xanthognathus have been interpreted as compatible with a mixed boreal forest to tundra parkland habitat based on faunal associations (Guilday 1971; Guilday et al. 1977; Hallberg et al. 1974; Richards 1988 ). Today, M. xanthognathus inhabits essentially the same type of environment, preferring tundra parkland (ecotone between boreal forest and tundra- Banfield, 1974) and disturbed boreal forest in early successional stages (Wolff 1980; Wolff and Lidicker 1980) over closed boreal forest. Such tundra parkland conditions would not have been dominant in the Midwest until just before, and shortly after, the glacial maximum (Baker et al. 1986; Schwert 1992; Schwert et al. 1997) .",

However, specimens from the Wapsipinicon (25,470 6 350 14 C years B.P.; Rafter Radiocarbon Laboratory no. NZA 10445- Wallace 2000) and Peccary Cave (11,430 6 90 14 C years B.P.; Center for Accelerator Mass Spectrometry, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory no. CAMS 20848-H. A. Semken, pers. comm.) local faunas of eastern Iowa and Arkansas, respectively, show that M. xanthognathus was present in Iowa well before the onset of full glacial conditions (Wallace 2000) and remained as far south as Arkansas long after the glacial maximum. Moreover, the southernmost living populations of this vole do occur in semiclosed boreal forest (as opposed to the more open environments in the northern reaches of their range). For these reasons, it is important to distinguish fossils of M. pennsylvanicus from those of M. xanthognathus to better understand the northwestern retreat of M. xanthognathus from southern late Pleistocene localities and to accurately reconstruct the paleoecosystems that sustained southern populations of either taxon at that time. Qualitative characters have been proposed for distinguishing M. pennsylvanicus from M. xanthognathus (Guilday 1982; Hallberg et al. 1974; Semken and Wallace 2002) , but Bell and Repenning (1999) demonstrated the need for statistical testing of any ''diagnostic'' characters within the genus Microtus. Smartt (1977 ), van Dam (1996 , and Marcolini (2002 Marcolini ( -2003 have shown the potential of multivariate approaches for differentiating species of Microtus and other rodent genera. Unfortunately, the majority of these studies were limited in the number of taxa examined or by the use of nonhomologous characters. Consequently, Bell and Glennon (2003) stressed that such techniques are valid only if applicable to all members of a genus.",

Triangles are considered ''closed'' when the enamel of a re-entrant angle nearly (or completely) meets the opposing re-entrant angle with a separation of less than the width of the thickest enamel band (T1; Fig. 2 ).

Bookstein (1991) classifies 3 landmark types, based on subjectivity. Type I landmarks are those that are defined by the discrete juxtaposition of tissues. In 3 dimensions, this includes the intersection of 3 or more structures, or in 2 dimensions, the intersection of 2 or more linear features. These landmarks are most easily defined and reproduced; therefore they carry the greatest weight in any analysis. Type II landmarks are placed at maximum points of curvature, tips of excursions, or other morphogenetic features. Finally, type III landmarks are defined in terms of farthest, closest, perpendicular, tangential, and so on. These landmarks are referred to as deficient (Bookstein 1991) because they typically involve 1 feature only and, consequently, contain less information and are more difficult to place or define consistently. Although they are the weakest in terms of reproducibility and placement confidence, type III landmarks are by far the most common because many morphological features used in descriptive taxonomy cannot be defined in terms of multiple structures.",

This definition would suffice if the 2 enamel bands intersected at a single point; however, this is not always the case. In examples where the intersection is rounded (landmarks 12, 16, and 20) , the corresponding landmark should be redefined as the point of maximum enamel curvature at the boundary. This does not change the location of the landmark, but does change its classification to type II. An alternative location for these landmarks would be the outer edge of the showing location of homologous points chosen as landmarks. Points 3, 5, 7, and 9 are at intersection of leading and trailing edges of enamel on triangles 1, 3, 5, and 7, respectively, and are placed at the border of enamel and dentine; points 2, 4, 6, 8, 11, 15, and 19 are at most medial point of the re-entrant angles at the boundary between enamel and cement; points 10, 13, and 17 are at intersection of the leading and trailing edges of enamel on triangles 2, 4, and 6, respectively, and are at the border of enamel and dentine; points 1 and 21 are at terminal ends of enamel band on either side of the posterior loop; points 14 and 18 are at the most posterior position along the boundary of dentine and enamel of trailing edges of triangles 4 and 2, respectively; and points 12, 16, and 20 are on outside edge of the enamel band at point of maximum curvature along the leading edges of triangle 4, triangle 2, and the posterior loop, respectively. Scale bar equals 1 mm. salient angles. However, given that the outer edges of the triangles are typically damaged or incomplete on fossil specimens, the loss of relative value from (occasionally) reclassifying these landmarks is outweighed by increased utility of the inner portion of triangles, which have a greater frequency of preservation. Lastly, although 9 of my landmarks are classified as type III (2, 4, 6, 8, 11, 14, 15, 18, and 19) , they are essential to this analysis because they characterize the reentrant angles, which are preserved more frequently than other features of the tooth, are easily observed features commonly used in descriptive taxonomy, and are often species specific within Microtus (Martin 1991; van der Meulen 1978) .",

To remove problems associated with size from the data set, I transformed the variables into shape coordinates by scaling the data to a standard baseline using GRF-nd (''generalized rotational fitting of n-dimensional data,'' a computer program written by Dennis E. Slice, Department of Ecology and Evolution, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York). By scaling the data in this way, each tooth had an effective length of 1 unit with all other coordinates recalculated relative to that length (baseline). Accordingly, differences in point location more closely correspond to differences in shape rather than size. Because of their placement confidence, likelihood of preservation, and conformation to Bookstein's (1991) requirement of the longest possible baseline, I chose landmarks 2 and 9 ( Fig. 3) as the baseline ([0, 0] , [1, 0] ) from which all other shape coordinates were generated. Although I removed damaged modern specimens in order to generate a more refined discriminant function, paleontological applications could include all specimens that preserve (at least) the baseline.",

In addition, the teeth of M. pennsylvanicus have been shown to exhibit spatial and temporal clinal (continuous between populations) variation in length and morphology (Barnosky 1990 (Barnosky , 1993 Davis 1987) . Occlusal length overlap between species (Fig. 1 ) and the results of the stepwise analyses also show that m1 occlusal length and the size variable produced by GRF-nd have little diagnostic value for discriminating M. pennsylvanicus from M. xanthognathus.

Seventy-two of 76 Recent m1s were correctly identified to species, but with confidence levels as low as 40% (18 , 75%, only 37 . 95%). Nonetheless, these results suggested that identification of isolated molars is possible using multiple variables. However, although linear variables are successful, landmarks are a more direct measure of true morphologic difference, and hence offer greater support for (confidence in) subjective observations. Selecting landmarks for my study was difficult because it required a balance of practicality and utility. The logical choice would be placement along the outer edge of the enamel band that surrounds the tooth. However, landmarks at the more interior boundary between enamel and dentine of salient angles (3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 13, and 17; Fig. 3 ) are more likely to be preserved on fossils than those on the external side of the enamel (1 and 21; Fig. 3 ), which is often chipped or broken. Additionally, the intersection of leading and trailing edges is more easily recognized on the inside of a curve relative to the outside. Selection of landmarks with higher preservation frequency allows my discriminant analysis to be applied across a broader range of fossil and archaeological material.",

Undoubtedly a subjective measure of confidence is required for classifications derived from these functions.

This is expected, because some landmarks likely have no diagnostic value (either too little or too much variation), or are strongly correlated with other characters. However, some taxa may be morphologically similar enough to warrant use of all variables to achieve consistent identification.

This procedure can be applied to specimens from sites where these 2 taxa are (or were) sympatric, preventing misidentification of isolated m1s from archaeological and paleontological samples.
