Here Baiomys was associated with Peromyscus maniculatus, Perognathus flavus, Reithrodontomys montanus, Onychomys torridus, O. leucogaster, Sigmodon minimus, and Perognathus baileyi, in order of decreasing abundance. Dipodomys merriami and D. spectabilis were taken from nearby areas of sparse grass. In August, 1956, in the Sulfur Springs Valley, 4 miles west of Pearce, 4,700 ft., Cochise County, I collected the pigmy mouse from a small strip of Hilaria iamesii approximately 30 yards wide and several times as long. Perognathus flavus and Onychomys torridus were also taken from .the heavy grass. at this locality, while the surrounding relatively bare areas yielded Dipodomys merriami, Perognathus penicillatus, Onychomys tOrridU8 and Peromyscus sp. Baiomys remains were found in barn owl pellets collected by E. Lendell Cockrum near Dos Cabezas, Cochise County, also in the Sulfur Springs Valley. In September, 1956, six pigmy mice were taken from mixed heavy grasses on the eastern alluvial fan of the Santa Rita mountains, 6 miles north of Sonoita, 4,600 ft., Pima County. The only other rodent trapped here was Sigmodon minimus. This locality represents a new northwestern limit to the ranges of both Baiomys taylori and Sigmodon minimus. At all these localities traps set in dense grass yielded more Baiomys than any other species of rodent.",

Here no traps were set in heavy grass along the road to Hereford and in an ungrazed field just north of Nicksville. Although Blossom collected Baiomys, Sigmodon minimus and S. hispidus here in 1941, I obtained only Sigmodon hispidus, Onychomys torridus and Perognathu8 baileyi. Hoffmeister and Goodpaster (Illinois BioI. Monogr., 24( 1), 1954) also failed to collect Baiomys taylori and Sigmodon minimus in this area in 1950, after approximately 600 trap-nights. I agree with their opinion that the grass appears dense enough to provide good cover for these rodents. Perhaps these two species were exterminated by a factor such as drought or overgrazing and have not re-invaded the area. The possibility exists, however, that some currently operating but unrecognized factor is preventing their re-establishment.",
