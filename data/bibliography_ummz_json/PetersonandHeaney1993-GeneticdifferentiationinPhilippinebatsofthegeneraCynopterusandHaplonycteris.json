The effect of historical connectedness of populations is simple: longer time since separation should be associated with greater genetic differentiation (Kimura, 1983) because substitution rates of neutral characters should be roughly uniform through time. Vagility of organisms, in the form of long-distance dispersal, translates into higher gene flow and consequently to reduced isolation by distance and differentiation of populations (Wright, 1938 (Wright, , 1978 . In contrast, differences in effective population size (where population size is constant) should affect rates of evolution only of characters under natural selection (Kimura, 1983) . Other factors, such as natural selection, can also produce progressive genetic differentiation of populations. Because detailed studies of survival and lifetime reproduction have not been conducted, however, these factors are not addressed in this paper.",

Still fewer studies have compared the relative importance of two or more such factors. In this study, we compare the roles of historical connectedness, vagility and population size in producing intraspecific genetic differentiation in two species of pteropodid bats in the Philippines: Cynopterus brachyotis Muller and Haplonycteris jscheri Lawrence. Comparisons across islands that differ in historical connection and area allow assessment of the effects of historical connectedness and population size. Because the two genera appear to differ sharply in their habitat use and vagility, they provide an indirect test of the effects of vagility on differentiation. Data presented herein represent one of the first biochemical genetic investigations of any mammal from south-east Asia (e.g. Fooden & Lanyon, 1989; Heaney & Ruedi, 1991) , and one of a very few investigations of the genetics of bats of the suborder Megachiroptera (McCracken & Wilkinson, 1988) .",

It is an off-rider of the Asian continent that first appeared as dry land above sea water during the late Eocene or early Oligocene (references in Heaney, 1986 Heaney, , 1991a Mitchell, Hernandez & De La Cruz, 1986) . One portion of the archipelago, the Palawan group, was joined to the Asian mainland during the middle Pleistocene period of low sea level, c. 160 000 years BP. All other portions of the archipelago were thrust above sea level by volcanic and tectonic activity associated with the many subduction zones that bracket the archipelago; none had any dry-land connections to the Asian mainland. Most of the growth of the islands has occurred since the beginning of the Miocene, and much since the Pliocene, with most current topography probably close to its maximum level. Because the islands are on a high but shallow platform, they were heavily influenced by repeated Pleistocene changes in sea level that were associated with the development of continental ice sheets. During the most recent period of low sea level in the Pleistocene (from c. 20 000 to 10 000 BP), existing islands merged for the most part into four islands: Greater",

During late Pleistocene climatic fluctuations, Luzon and Catanduanes merged to form part of Greater Luzon, and Leyte and Biliran merged to form part of Greater Mindanao. Each of the Pleistocene islands has been documented as a centre of endemism; for example, Greater Luzon and Greater Mindanao have 72 and 79% endemism among nonvolant indigenous mammal species, respectively (Heaney, 1986) . The fruit bat Cynopterus bruchyotis, which weighs about 30 g, is widespread in south-east Asia, ranging from Sri Lanka to Sulawesi (Honacki, Kinman & Koeppl, 1982) . It is strongly associated with disturbed habitats, including urban areas, orchards and second-growth, where it is often the most abundant fruit bat species. It also occurs at low density in primary forest (Heaney et ul., Heideman & Heaney, 1989) .

The sole species, H-Jischeri, is often the most abundant fruit bat in primary forest, but is rare or absent outside of primary or lightly disturbed forest and avoids large clearings in forested regions (Heaney et ul., 1989;  Heiderman & Heaney, 1989) . Haplonycteris Jischeri is moderately widespread in the Philippines, but is absent from small and isolated islands (Heaney et al., 1987; Heaney, 1991a) . These observations suggest that bats of this genus may have limited dispersal abilities. For example, Maripipi Island, which lies 9 km north of Biliran and was part of Greater Mindanao, has habitat that seems identical to that on Biliran. O n three occasions (1981, 1984, 1987) , Huplonycteris has been sought without success on Maripipi using the same techniques that were successful on Biliran and Leyte (Rickart et ul., 1993) . Hence, we believe that Huplonycteris is absent from Maripipi, in spite of suitable habitat and close proximity (9 km) to a source population.",

Allele frequencies and indices of variation (heterozygosity H , percent of loci polymorphic at any frequency POLY, number of alleles per locus NALL) were calculated. Departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was tested using a x2 test with Levene's correction for small sample sizes (Swofford & Selander, 1989) . The following genetic distance measures were calculated: Nei's (1978) and Rogers' (as modified by Wright, 1978) distances, and the Cavalli-Sforza & Edwards ( 1967) arc-distance. Simple F-statistics were calculated, and a hierarchical F-statistic analysis (Swofford & Selander, 1989) was conducted by grouping islands according to their Pleistocene connections ( Fig. 1 ) : (Sibuyan), (Negros), (Biliran, Leyte), (Catanduanes, Luzon). Rates of gene flow among populations (Nm) were estimated using the 'private alleles' method of Slatkin (1985) ; confidence levels for these estimates were obtained by jackknifing across populations (Slatkin, 1985) . An index to level of differentiation (DZFF, Table 2 ) was calculated for each population as the mean modified Rogers' genetic distance to the other five populations. A crude summary of effective population sizes was obtained by ranking populations by island size, on the assumptions that total population size is correlated with island area and that effective population size is influenced by the total number of individuals on the island. Current geographic distance matrices were constructed based on great-circle distances between latitude-longitude coordinates of collection localities; geographic distances separating Pleistocene islands were estimated from 120 m bathymetric contours on navigation charts of varying scale published by the Defense Mapping Agency (Heaney, 1986 (Heaney, , 1991a . Comparisons of distance matrices were made using Mantel's test (Mantel, 1967) procedures in NTSYS-pc, version 1.40 (Rohlf, 1988) .",

This contrast may be confounded by differences in recency of colonization. Cynopterus, which has conspecific populations in mainland south-east Asia, may be a more recent immigrant to the Philippines than the endemic Haplonycteris, and for this reason may possess less genetic structure. However, an alternative is that the reduced vagility and greater habitat specificity of Haplonycteris has caused more rapid differentiation than in the mobile, eurytopic Cynopterus (e.g. Peterson, 1992) . Our estimates of rates of gene flow among populations are two orders of magnitude lower in Haplonycteris than in Cynopterus. The estimates of the gene flow parameter N m for Haplonycteris meet the condition N m < 1 of Wright (1938; Slatkin, 1985) for differentiation under genetic drift alone, whereas estimates for Cynopterus do not. Hence, Haplonycteris populations receive little enough gene flow that either genetic drift or natural selection may easily lead to differentiation between populations, whereas Cynopterus populations receive enough gene flow to retard differentiation by drift, potentially accounting for the difference in the structure of genetic variation between the two species. These alternatives are not mutually exclusive; so, in the present study, the effects of reduced gene flow and recency of colonization cannot be separated.",

This result may indicate that the bat populations of the six islands under study have been influenced by similar historical factors. However, trees resulting from this study have several limitations. Because outgroups by which to root the trees could not be included in the study, the trees are midpoint-rooted. This approach assumes that rates of allozyme evolution are relatively homogeneous, and hence that the longest branch in a network represents the oldest split. Also, because our phenetic analyses are sensitive to the many problems of non-cladistic approaches of phylogeny estimation (Swofford & Olsen, 1990) , we consider them to be more than preliminary indicators of relationships.",

On the basis of the distributions of Philippine mammals and their mainland relatives, the most likely sequence of colonization events can be reconstructed for Asian mainland species entering the Philippine archipelago (Brown & Alcala, 1970; Heaney, 1991a) . No evidence suggests that any mammal (except humans and commensals) has successfully entered the main body of the Philippines from the north (Taiwan or China; Heaney, 1986 Heaney, , 1991a . Similarly, only limited or ambiguous evidence suggests that mammals (Heany, 1986) , reptiles or amphibians (Brown & Alcala, 1970) have entered the main body of the Philippines by way of the Palawan group. In nearly all well-studied cases, colonization appears to have taken place by way of Borneo and Mindanao, possibly related to the narrowness of the sea channels to be crossed on this route (Fig. 1) . Therefore, a most conservative colonization sequence for the populations under study would have Greater Mindanao (including modern Biliran and Leyte) as the probable first island colonized, and Greater Luzon (including modern Luzon and Catanduanes) and Negros as secondary colonizations. The populations of Sibuyan represent either another secondary colonization or a tertiary colonization via Greater Negros.",

First, because the slope of the species-area relationship in fruit bats is shallower than that of non-volant mammals, Heaney (1991a) proposed that fruit bats either have lower extinction rates than do non-volant mammal populations, or that periodic recolonization of small islands takes place. The extensive genetic differentiation between islands in Haplonycteris (and to a lesser degree in Cynopterus) documented in this study suggests a long period of residence on each island without substantial gene flow from other populations, hence supporting the hypothesis of reduced extinction rates. Second, Heaney (1991a) documented a relatively large minimum island size (c. 12 500 km2) for the presence of endemic species of fruit bats. Two alternative explanatory hypotheses were proposed: that fruit bats require large islands to maintain populations in the long term, or that additional endemics remain to be discovered on small islands in the archipelago. The presence of a population as strikingly differentiated as the Sibuyan Haplonycteris on such a small island indicates that fruit bats can maintain genetically isolated, stable populations on small islands, and supports the second hypothesis.",

However, the great majority of these studies have treated rodent populations, and other mammalian orders have gone largely unstudied (Kilpatrick, 1981) . Similarly, studies of genetic differentiation in insular mammal populations have largely focused on peripheral populations of widespread continental species, and few have treated endemic insular radiations (Berry, 1983; Patton, 1984) .
