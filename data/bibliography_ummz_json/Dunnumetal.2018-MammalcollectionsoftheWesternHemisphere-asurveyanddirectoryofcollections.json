The SCC surveyed 429 collections and compiled a directory of 395 active collections containing 5,275,155 catalogued specimens. Over the past decade, 43 collections have been lost or transferred and 38 new or unsurveyed collections were added. Growth in number of total specimens, expansion of genomic resource collections, and substantial gains in digitization and web accessibility were documented, as well as slight shifts in proportional representation of taxonomic groups owing to increasingly balanced geographic representation of collections relative to previous surveys. While we find the overall health of Western Hemisphere collections to be adequate in some areas, gaps in spatial and temporal coverage and clear threats to long-term growth and vitality of these resources have also been identified. Major expansion of the collective mammal collection resource along with a recommitment to appropriate levels of funding will be required to meet the challenges ahead for mammalogists and other users, and to ensure samples are broad and varied enough that unanticipated future needs can be powerfully addressed.",

This deep association between collections and natural sciences dates to the earliest period of collecting and classifying nature and continues to this day, as collections contribute to research across an array of critical disciplines including biodiversity studies, emerging diseases, biological invasions, environmental contaminants, and global climate change (Suarez and Tsutsui 2004) . In mammalogy specifically, collections represent essential infrastructure for research, training, and education that continue to play vital roles in longestablished fields (systematics, taxonomy, and natural history) while also contributing to new research areas (e.g., genomics, stable isotopes, pathogen discovery). Looking into the future, it is easy to visualize collections as a physical nexus for environmental informatics and big data synthesis (McLean et al. 2016; Funk 2018; Cook and Light in press ). However, achieving this goal will depend on whether or not current collections remain adequately positioned in terms of taxonomic, temporal, and spatial coverage to address new questions in a period of unprecedented environmental change (Malaney and Cook 2018) . As stewards and builders of these invaluable resources, mammalogists must critically evaluate specimen holdings, their accessibility, and the overall health of the infrastructure to direct growth and develop plans to meet future challenges. With these aims in mind, over the course of its history, the American Society of Mammalogists (ASM) has undertaken periodic evaluations of the mammal collections held in the Western Hemisphere.",

Combined with 306 collections in the United States, a total of 391 collections was included, an 18% reduction from the 474 collections reported by Yates et al. (1987) . This decline was attributed, in part, to inclusion in the 1983 survey of many collections which did not respond and likely were no longer operating, thus resulting in an overestimation of active collections. Notably, private collections were essentially absent from the 1997 survey. Despite the dramatic decrease in overall number of collections, the total specimens reported for that survey increased to 4,194,305. The growing trend of computerized catalogues was evident in the 1996 survey, with one-half of the collections from Canada and the United States and 37% of Latin American collections digitized to some extent (Hafner et al. 1997) .",

Taxonomic holdings from these collections were summarized at the ordinal level, and ordinal taxonomy of specimens was updated as necessary. Geographic scope of collections was summarized at the country level, as not all digital specimen records contain geocoordinates. To provide perspective on representation of global mammal diversity contained in Western Hemisphere collections, the digital specimen records were summarized according to their country of collection. These data were then paired with information from the IUCN on species endemicity within countries (IUCN 2017; accessed at http://www.iucnredlist.org/about/summary-statistics), allowing visualization of how effectively Western Hemisphere collections have targeted mammal diversity both locally and globally.",

The total number of active collections has remained between 390 and 395 over the past 20 years (Fig. 1 ). However, this perceived equilibrium actually masks an underlying state of flux, because we detected large numbers of collections as defunct or transferred, and many newly created or previously unsurveyed collections were added. Since the 2007 survey, 9 collections are missing and their dispositions unknown, 34 were fully or partially transferred to other collections, and 38 new or unsurveyed collections were added. Over the 2 decades since Hafner et al. (1997) published a list of defunct or transferred collections, 45 additional collections have closed or have been transferred (Supplementary Data SD1). A troubling statistic is that the majority of these (31) were university-based collections, indicative of a trend of decreasing institutional support for such resources within universities (Dalton 2003; Gropp 2003 Gropp , 2004 Schmidly 2005 ). This is a significant problem for mammalogy, as fewer young mammalogists are exposed to museum specimens and their value and centrality in biological science (Cook and Light, in press) . Other areas also have not been immune to contraction, as 7 federal or state agency collections were transferred or lost and private collections further declined in number since the last survey. Only a few privately held collections remain active and at least 2 prominent collections of this type (the Robert and Virginia Rausch and the E. Thomas Seton collections) were recently transferred to university-based collections. We view the incorporation of private collections into public collections as a positive trend as their accessibility and physical security are greatly increased.",

The higher growth rate over the most recent decade reflected in our survey includes approximately 150,000 specimens (20% of total growth) reported by 38 collections not previously surveyed, and thus does not entirely represent new material collected over the last decade. The specimen growth we recorded also was not evenly distributed across collections. About 58% of the overall growth since 2007 was in the 20 largest collections (those with > 50,000 specimens), which added 449,823 specimens (ca. 45,000/year). The remaining 337 collections accounted for 22% of the decadal growth. Therefore, growth trends across decades (Table 1) should be viewed with some caution due to variation in reporting methods, inclusion of uncatalogued specimens in some reports, and the inherent issues concerning precision of data related to surveys.",

Mammal collections not only have the specimens and samples required for research, but also possess the rigorous archival and database standards that ensure best practices in pathogen discovery, designation and deposition of host symbiotypes, and robust linkages between host specimens, their pathogens, genetic sequences, and any other derived data (Dunnum et al. 2017) .",

As new questions and technologies arise, the limiting resource often will be availability of quality samples with associated temporal and spatial data. An encouraging development is the enhanced DNA extraction and high-throughput next generation sequencing techniques that are now allowing successful utilization of a variety of historic dry and fixed specimens for genome level molecular research (e.g., Rowe et al. 2011; Burrell et al. 2015; Hykin et al. 2015; McDonough et al. 2018 ). This extremely positive advance points to the increasing value of museum specimens through time, and will certainly increase use of specimens in the future. However, high-quality tissue, when available, remains the gold standard for many current research areas (e.g., transcriptomics, pathogen discovery). Natural history collections are already leaders in traditional specimen and data archiving infrastructure. In the future, curators and collection managers need to enhance our capabilities as major tissue biorepositories capable of not only addressing traditional questions but also imminent issues concerning emerging zoonotic diseases, human health, and environmental change (Dunnum et al. 2017 ). Because collections provide the physical infrastructure, knowledgeable personnel, and protocols necessary to carefully curate specimen vouchers and their associated molecular vouchers (e.g., DNA, tissue), they are ideal places to establish and build large-scale biorepositories (Astrin et al. 2013) .",

In 2007, approximately 36% of collections and 77% of specimens were digitized in at least some form (Fig. 8 ). Since that survey, an additional 100 collections have been digitized, resulting in 62% of collections and 94% of specimens being digitized in some format. While a substantial number of collections remain undigitized, these are predominantly smaller collections, and only account for 6% of all specimens (Fig. 8) . However, these smaller collections typically document regional and local faunas that may not be represented in larger, digitized collections. Thus, despite their relatively low numbers of specimens, these collections could add great value to the overall resource if digitized and made available to the global research community. Digitization would also allow the status of smaller collections to be monitored more efficiently (e.g., in SCC surveys). Indeed, accurate data on smaller collections will be critical given that these comprise the majority of Western Hemisphere collections and in view of existing data deficiencies and rates of collection transfers that we observed for these types of collections.",

                "text": "Although initial digitization is a critical first step in enhancing access to, and redundancy of, collection data, the most significant gains in accessibility and research usage come through data standardization (e.g., with use of Darwin Core terms), precise georeferencing of localities, and especially web accessibility of the data through searchable, relational databases (e.g., Arctos.db, specifysoftware.org). Distribution of these databases to larger data aggregators (e.g., VertNet, GBIF, SpeciesLink) is also key, and should be accompanied by direct links to specimen records and the various data already derived from them (e.g., GenBank, Isobank, Morphobank). Once standardized and accessible, researchers, students, educators, and the general public alike can easily investigate mammalian biology and biogeography through a host of applications and web-based tools (e.g., Google Earth, BerkeleyMapper, Map of Life, Tree of Life, Encyclopedia of Life). Many new initiatives are integrating digitized museum data and specimen-based research directly into education (Cook et al. 2014 (Cook et al. , 2016c Lacey et al. 2017) . These new uses of collections and associated data can be instrumental in training the next generation of specimenbased mammalogists as well as engaging teachers, students, and the public to help address scientific questions and societal issues such as climate change, biodiversity loss, and emerging pathogens (Cook et al. 2016c) . Additionally, digitization allows a collection to provide efficient and accurate documentation of use and research impact to administrators or funding agencies. An effective mechanism for tracking research impact is the creation of a Google Scholar profile for studies involving use of a collection's specimens (Winker and Withrow 2013; Cook and Light, in press ). Taxonomic and geographic holdings.-Seventy-nine mammal collections (20% of all collections) reporting 3,691,406 specimen records (70% of all estimated specimens) were located in GBIF and SpeciesLink searches. That figure is comparable to, but slightly lower than, the number of specimen records reported to be web-accessible in our survey results (i.e., 73%). To use aggregated data as a broad proxy for the taxonomic and geographic scope of specimens contained in Western Hemisphere collections (i.e., in this and future surveys), it is necessary to ensure that major sampling biases do not exist. Because our analysis is limited to the level of mammalian orders, as well as to broad geographic regions above the level of individual countries, we believe taxonomic and geographic biases should be limited. It is more difficult to determine the taxonomic and geographic distribution of the 30% of specimens not available via GBIF and SpeciesLink. Based on physical locations of the unavailable collections, about onethird are from collections in Latin America and the Caribbean and two-thirds from US and Canadian collections. Under the assumption that specimen localities are, for the most part, from the country in which the collection is based, approximately 531,000 specimens held in Latin American and Caribbean collections and 911,000 in Canadian and US collections are missing from our analyses. Because these percentages are not drastically different than total collection representation, we do not think our analyses based on available data should be heavily biased. Taxonomic summary.-Taxonomic representation of the digitized specimen data roughly reflects the species diversity of mammalian orders in the Western Hemisphere at large. Rodentia is by far the most highly represented order (60% of all specimens), followed by Chiroptera, Carnivora, and Eulipotyphla. The orders Artiodactyla and Lagomorpha make up an additional 5% of specimens, while the remainder of mammalian orders comprise 3% of the total (Fig. 10) . However, some smallerbodied taxa (rodents, shrews, bats) are likely overrepresented in collections relative to their actual species diversity due to an easier ability to collect multiple specimens per species. For example, when compared to their proportion of extant mammalian species diversity (~40%-Burgin et al. 2018), rodents are significantly overrepresented (60%) and most other orders are underrepresented, a pattern seen specifically in US specimens as well (Malaney and Cook 2018) .",

To achieve highest standards in deposition and maintenance of specimens, we must work to increase the number of accredited collections both nationally and internationally.

As traditional specimen types are augmented with new materials (e.g., genomic resources, associated parasites, microbiomes), our concept of voucher specimens evolves (Kageyama et al. 2007) , and as all of these materials are increasingly digitized and discoverable to the broader research community, their potential to contribute to biodiversity science and important societal questions related to our changing planet and human health increase significantly (Cook and Light, in press ). Several caveats related to methodologies and available sampling notwithstanding, the present survey documents growth in the number of specimens, large increases in genomic resource collections and digitization and web accessibility, slight shifts in proportional representation of taxonomic groups, and increasing geographic balance relative to previous surveys.",

Total numbers of specimens were not only extremely low but the majority of specimens were also from very early expeditions, with very few specimens having been collected over the past 40 years. Thus, we lack both spatial and temporal coverage in these biologically rich and heavily impacted areas.

The coarse and time-averaged metrics of collections growth used in our survey therefore belie a more precipitous decrease in specimen acquisition for some taxa and geographic areas. The masking of this trend can be partially attributed to inclusion of previously unreported collections to the survey and perhaps a shift to collecting in non-US locales as opposed to monitoring of biodiversity within the United States. We see a pattern of relatively low specimen growth across the larger and historically active collections (Table 2 ) and note issues with decreased funding that not only impede growth, but threaten the sustainability of even our most prominent of collections, the Biological Survey Unit at the United States National Museum of Natural History (Sikes et al. 2018) .",

An example is the recently initiated National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON; http:// www.neonscience.org/). This network was established to create a nationwide (continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico) web of environmental monitoring sites (Kao et al. 2012) to be sampled over the ensuing 30 years. This presented a unique opportunity to build high-quality collections of holistic mammal specimens (e.g., full vouchers, tissues, and associated parasites and pathogens-Cook et al. 2016a) from across the United States, spanning this critical period of environmental change. The collections community was involved in early discussions on the objectives and desired products of this project, but upon implementation, environmental monitoring trumped building robust specimen-based infrastructure. Mammal collecting is part of the NEON sampling protocol; however, current methods (primarily mark-recapture with minimal sampling of hair, blood, and DNA) result in either volumes that are too small for multiple uses or sample types that are inadequate to address the majority of specimen-based research questions. Protocols stressing a more rigorous, voucher-based sampling regime of the small mammal communities, and thus their associated parasite and pathogen communities, have been proposed and endorsed by mammalogists and parasitologists (Cook et al. 2016b) . The mammal research community must continue to encourage funding agencies to require that sampling be conducted in a manner that ensures usefulness of specimens for a breadth of research questions (e.g., Suarez and Tsutsui 2004) .",
