In many cases, acoustic systems have been developed for automated species classification of huge volumes of call data. In the case of bats, echolocation calls are not songs, making the identification to species from bat calls a challenging exercise that requires suitable cross-testing of results using reliably identified calls, e.g., from captured and released individuals (Barclay 1999; Taylor et al. 2013; Monadjem et al. 2017; Rydell et al. 2017) . Similarly, camera traps have enabled efficient and comprehensive surveys of medium and large-sized mammals and other groups (Stein et al. 2008; Tobler et al. 2008; Rovero and Marshall 2009; Rovero et al. 2014) .",

Subsequent to this publication, Angola has been largely neglected in terms of mammal survey effort. For example, those who led the Smithsonian Institution's ambitious African Mammal Project (1961 -1972 , which collected 63,213 voucher specimens from throughout Africa and led to the definitive \"Mammals of Africa: An Identification Guide\" (Meester and Setzer 1971) , did not visit Angola at all (Schmidt et al. 2008) .

Another important museum in Angolan history is that established in Dundo. This was a relatively well-stocked museum and was in an important location (in the far northeast) for tropical species. There are at least two important papers by A Monard in 1931 and 1935 (cited in Hayman 1963 ) that detail the bat species in that collection (as well as other mammals). The small mammals in this collection were reviewed by Hayman (1963) and he mentioned 602 specimens that he examined (apparently these were shipped to him in London) belonging to 91 species and subspecies (including some 14 not previously reported for Angola).",

Of the taxa described by Bocage, although most have been relegated to synonyms or subspecies in current lists, at least eight currently recognized Angolan mammals were named by him: the Angolan fruit bats Epomophorus angolensis and Epomops dobsoni, the murid rodents Myomyscus Figure 1 .

Call analysis and identification was undertaken independently by three observers (PJT, MK and DP) although consensus was later obtained on the definition of call parameters for each species after extensive consultation and comparison of calls by PJT. Based on this, a final species list was derived by PJT (Table 1 ). Using Kaleidoscope Pro software (Wildlife Acoustics), the wave files collected with two SMBAT2+ detectors during the early 2016 season (February to April 2016), both from the Cuanavale River transect and from recordings by PJT in the Cuanavale and Cuito source areas, were firstly converted to zero-crossing (ANABAT) files and then identified manually by PJT using AnalookW software (version 4.1t, Chris Corbin, www.hoarybat.com), for comparison with zero-crossing ANABAT calls obtained directly from ANABAT SD1 and SD2 detectors. The latter included recordings from a SD2 bat detector from the Cuanavale and Cuito source lakes area and Cuchi Gorge in early 2016, as well as those from an Anabat SD1 detector during the 2017 transect of the Cubango River. Identifications were based on reference calls obtained both from ANABAT calls from captured and field-identified individuals that were subsequently released, as well as from standard references (Monadjem et al. 2010 (Monadjem et al. , 2017 Happold and Happold 2013; Taylor et al. 2013) and unpublished call data (Taylor, unpublished, Monadjem, unpublished) . Using the same identification criteria, calls recorded from the Cuanavale and Saliakembo source lakes in late 2016 using EM3, SM2+ and Anabat SD2 detectors were identified by MK, while calls recorded with the EM3 detector during the 2015 transect of the Cuito and Okavango Rivers were identified by DP using a different software (Sono-Bat). After extensive comparisons of calls and consultation between PJT, MK, and DP, PJT derived a standard list of putative bat species. This library of identified calls is available on request from PJT.",

To ensure independence of capture events for each camera trap, images of individuals of the same species were ignored if captured within one hour of a previous sighting (O'Brien et al. 2003) . For each photograph we recorded the site, date, time, and species. We excluded sightings of birds, small (< 1 kg) mammals, domestic animals, people, and any unidentifiable images. The total number of capture events (n) per species was tallied and their percentage contribution (spp %) to the total number of photographs was calculated.

However, the estimate of terrestrial small mammal richness is probably grossly under-estimated as a GBIF search of central Angola yielded 42 species, compared with our list of 13 species of shrews and rodents based on captures. Many of the small mammals recorded in our survey such as shrews, Anchieta's vlei rat and fruit bats are habitat specialists which would be adversely affected by deterioration of wetlands due to anthropogenic effects such as extensive fires, tree clearing, wetland drainage and overgrazing, typical in the Miombo woodlands (Syampungani et al. 2009; Jew et al. 2016) . Fruit bats provide valuable ecosystem services through seed dispersal and pollination, Anchieta's broad-faced fruit bat possesses whiskers which are thought to be involved in pollination (Monadjem et al. 2010) . Bats of the genera Eidolon, Epomophorus, and Rousettus are known to pollinate baobab trees (Adansonia digitata) over much of Africa (Baum 1995) .",

The species H. leucorhina is classified as Data Deficient and is known from just 10 scattered Table 3 .

If a species was recorded in both camera-trapping surveys, the values for both surveys are separated by a backslash (i.e., C1/C2). This order is represented by seven terrestrial families in Africa: Canidae (dogs), Mustelidae (weasels, polecats and allies), Nandiniidae (palm civet), Felidae (cats), Viverridae (genets and civets), Hyaenidae (hyenas and aardwolf ) and Herpestidae (mongooses). Five canid species have been recorded in Angola.

However, our field data indicates that the largest of these obligate carnivores (the lion Panthera leo) occurs at much lower densities than the other felids. The lion is often one of the first species to be lost from the large carnivore guild when prey becomes limiting and/or conflict with humans escalates (sensu the effects of war). Thus, their presence in the south-east of Angola (albeit patchy) suggests some post-civil war recolonization.

The taxonomic history of H. flavescens is very confusing. It has been included as a chestnut-coloured race of different species included in either H. pulverulentus or H. ochraceus but these two last-mentioned species are now considered to have much more restricted distributions in South Africa and S Namibia and Somalia and Ethiopia respectively. Crawford-Cabral (1996) demonstrated that flavescens was conspecific with the blackish-coloured nigrata race from north-east Namibia, a view that we follow. Mustelidae. The Zorilla, Ictonyx striatus, ranges across a broad range of habitats of sub-Saharan Africa, and is common throughout its range, yet reported to be locally uncommon (Stuart and Stuart 2013b) . Our upper Okavango catchment study of 2016 recorded this species by visual sightings and camera trap surveys. African clawless otters, Aonyx capensis, are medium sized otter species, and occur widely, associated with seasonal rivers, and can occur in fresh and marine water. The clawless otter is reported to have a distribution range in the central and southern parts of Angola (Somers and Nel 2013 ), yet was not recorded in the 2016 assessment. The spotted necked otter, Hydrictis maculicollis appears to be closely linked to permanent freshwater systems with abundant food resources (fish) and shoreline cover. Their continental distribution is considered to be wide. However, there is a paucity of information for this otter species in Angola (Reed-Smith et al. 2015). The ratel, Mellivora capensis, occurs across Africa in most habitat types, from deserts to forests. This species is reported to exist in low densities, and is often regarded to be rare throughout its range (Begg et al. 2013) . This species was recorded in the Okavango catchment expedition through visual observation and camera trap survey. African striped weasels, Poecilogale albinucha, are thought to be uncommon and rare, throughout their extensive range in sub-Saharan Africa (Stuart and Stuart 2013c) , and are delineated to occur in the northern parts of Angola.",

This species was recorded from visual observation and through camera trap surveys in our upper Okavango catchment expedition. The Miombo genet, Genetta angolensis, originally known from three adult specimens, lost in a fire in 1978 (Crawford-Cabral 2013) has a broad distribution from Angola, Democratic Republic of Congo, Mozambique, Malawi, Zambia and Tanzania. This species is reported to be similar in size to the common genet, and occurs in \"open miombo woodlands\" and is reported to be locally common in some areas (e.g., the Luando Strict Nature Reserve (Central Angola) (Crawford-Cabral 2013, . The common genet, Genetta genetta, is a widespread and locally common genet, and in its southern distribution range occur from central and south Angola through Botswana, Namibia, Zimbabwe and South Africa, replaced to the east by the large spotted genet (Delibes and Gaubert 2013). Genetta maculata, along with G. tigrina and G. pardina form part of the 'large spotted genet complex' (Gaubert and Dunham 2013) . The species is very common and widespread with over 50 localities recorded by GBIF records. Based on camera trap images and visual sightings, G. maculata was present during the Okavango catchment expeditions in 2016. The servaline genet G. servalina is depicted as occurring in Cabinda by Van Rompaey and Colyn (2013c) but without any specimen or sighting records, its occurrence there is dubious albeit possible.",

Following the taxonomy of Kingdon and Hoffman (2013b) , a total of 32 artiodactlys are recognised in Angola, of which 26 are bovids (Suppl. material 1). Following the taxonomy of Groves and Grubb (2011) , the list would result in 35 Angolan Artiodactyla including 29 bovids. This increase of three bovid species is because these latter authors regard Lichtensteini's harbertebeest Alcelaphus lichtensteini as a separate species from the red hartebeest A. buselaphus; further-more, two species (a tropical forest Kabinda species and a southern savanna species) are recognised each within the African buffalo (Syncerus nanus and S. caffer respectively) and the bushbuck (Tragelaphus ornatus and T. phaleratus respectively) populations from Angola. The taxonomy of Groves and Grubb (2011) doubled the number of recognised African ungulate species. This species-splitting process would raise several local Angolan subspecies to species rank and result in name changes for several of the Angolan ungulates. It would make two bovid species endemic to Angola, the Angolan blue duiker Philantomba anchietae and the Angolan springbok Antidorcas angolensis. The klipsringer Oreotragus tyleri would become near-endemic to Angola, extending marginally to north-west Namibia.

These records provide valuable insights into the historical distribution of the larger ungulates, some of which have become extinct or almost extinct in the wild in Angola. For example, the GBIF database provides 13 georeferenced records of Lichtenstein's hartebeest from 13 localities throughout E Angola, whereas this species is now thought to be extinct in Angola (Gosling and Capellini 2013) . The GBIF database contains 213 records (including 25 museum specimens dating back to 1925) of the blackfaced impala (Aepyceros melampus petersi) from 78 georeferenced localities throughout S Angola whereas the status of the species in Angola is currently uncertain. It occurs at Iona National Park and possibly two other national parks (Fritz and Bourgarel 2013) . The case of the three sable subspecies, the nominate form (Hippotragus niger niger), Kirk's sable (H. niger kirkii) and the giant sable H. n. variani is also remarkable. All three subspecies were widespread in central, south-eastern, and eastern Angola (Figure 3 ) but are currently much more restricted. The giant sable came close to extinction during the Angola civil war and is currently known from just two reserves in central Angola, the Cangandalo National Park and the Luando Reserve (Figure 3) where its survival continues to be threatened by poaching and hybridization with roan antelope Hippotragus equinus (Vaz Pinto 2006 Estes 2013 ). In the case of Kirk's sable from eastern Angola, (Figure 3 ), there have been no observations for 40 years (Cabral and Ver\u00edssimo 2005) . However the nominate race (H. n. niger) is still known to occur in the region between the Cuito and Cuando Rivers in southeastern Angola, including the Luengue-Luiana and Mavinga National Parks (Funston et al. 2017, Figure 3 ). However no sable were detected in the present camera trap survey or ad hoc observations conducted in the upper Okavango catchment.",

The current survey added one new Angolan species record based on captures (Pipistrellus rusticus) and three tentative species records based on acoustic identification (Kerivoula argentata, Mops midas, Pipistrellus hesperidus; Table 2 ). Happold and Happold (2013) added one species (Triaenops afer). Merging these three sources resulted in a combined list of 71 species (Suppl. material 1). Over 220 species of bats have been recorded in mainland Africa of which over 75% occur in Sub-Saharan Africa (Happold and Happold 2013) . Of these, 116 species occur in southern Africa defined by Monadjem et al. (2010a) , a region which includes Angola. Within this region, the more diverse countries have bat species richness typically between 60-70 species (Monadjem et al. 2010b) . For example, 67 species have been recorded in Mozambique, 65 species in Zambia, and 62 species each in Malawi and Zimbabwe (Monadjem et al. 2010b) . Therefore, the current total of 71 species that we report for Angola in this study, is on the higher end of richness for the region, in spite of the fact that Angola remains one of the most poorly known southern African countries with respect to bats (and mammals in general). For example, during the course of just a few weeks of fieldwork we were able to add a new species of bat to the country list, as well as additional (possible) new records of a further three species, based on echolocation calls, which would bring the total up to 71 species (making it the most diverse country in the region). We suspect that there are numerous species of bat that still await discovery in Angola, and we further predict that a number of new (and possibly endemic) species will be eventually recorded from the western escarpment region that is high in bird endemism (Mills et al. 2011 (Mills et al. , 2013 . To the best of our knowledge, no recent bat (or other small mammal) surveys have been conducted in any of the remaining Afromontane forests and adjacent grasslands along this escarpment, and this must remain a critical zone for future surveys.",

To the best of our knowledge, Cabinda has not been surveyed specifically for bats before. We suspect that a large number of tropical rainforest species (e.g., Myopterus whitleyi, Mops annulus, Mops thersites and Nycteris grandis) will be shown to occur in Cabinda. The second is the extreme south-western arid zone on the Namibian border (part of which is included in Iona National Park). This region has also not been the focus of dedicated bat surveys, but may harbour arid zone specialist species (e.g., Sauromys petrophilus and Rhinolophus denti) that have not yet been recorded from Angola. We suspect that these three regions (western escarpment, south-western arid zone and Kabinda) will also harbour new country records of other mammal groups, and therefore encourage mammalogists to specifically target these areas.",

We suspect that future research will uncover endemic bat species to Angola, most probably along the western escarpment, and particularly on isolated mountain tops coated in forest. By way of example, Rhinolophus eloquens has been collected from Jau, Huila Province, a location that is over 2,000 km away from the closest records in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Rwanda. These specimens from the American Museum of Natural History are worth re-examining as we suspect that this may refer to a new species within the R. eloquens/R. hildebrandtii group.",

Frechkop are labelled as C. torquata. Although the species is known to occur near to the Cabinda border, for the moment we treat this record as uncertain. Although the Kinda baboon Papio kindae from Angola was included as a synonym of the yellow baboon P. cyanocephalus by Butynski et al. (2013) , it was shown to be distinct by Mittermeier et al. (2013) . Therefore P. kindae and not P. cyanocephalus is found in Angola. One species not included in the GBIF database but validated by Goossens et al. (2002) and Butynski et al. (2013) as occurring in Cabinda, is the robust chimpanzee Pan troglodytes. Considering the above, we consider there to be 16 species of primates occurring in Angola.",

                "text": "Gliridae. A high diversity of five species of dormice has been recorded in Angola. Muridae. Muridae comprises by far the largest family of rodents and 42 indigenous murid species occur in Angola. The species list from the GBIF database corresponded closely with that of Monadjem et al. (2015) . Our current trapping survey of the Okavango source lakes region added two murid rodent species to the list for Angola, Mus setzeri and Zelotomys woosnami (Table 1) . As both of these rodents are associated with sandy soils in arid savannas it was surprising to record them from mesic miombo woodlands in the Angolan highlands. However, the rivers and source lakes of the upper Okavango catchment are bordered by sandy habitats that form obvious corridors for the dispersal of these species from the lower catchments of the Okavango Basin where they have hitherto been recorded in Botswana and Namibia. Given that two murid species were added to the country after just two weeks of survey effort in a limited area, it is highly likely that more species of murid rodents will be shown to occur in Angola by future collecting. For example tropical species such as Deomys ferrugineus, Lophuromys ansorgei, Hybomys univitattus, Hylomyscus aeta, H. anselli, Mylomys dybowski, Praomys petteri and Stochomys longicaudatus occur close to the border of Kabinda or north Angola. On the other hand, species from arid savannas associated with the Okavanga River in Botswana and Namibia, such as Dasymys cabrali, may also be found to occur in the upper Okavanga catchments. Although the desert pygmy mouse Mus indutus was shown to occur in south-east Angola by Happold (2013) , identification of this species is difficult and no molecular sequences are available of this species from Angola (Lamb et al. 2014 , Monadjem et al. 2015 . Hence, this species is included in the checklist as a dubious record. Another semi-arid habitat murid species that extends into extreme south-west Angola is Rhabdomys bechuanae (Du Toit et al. 2012) .",

(2015) but the species does not appear to occur as widely in north Angola as indicated in Happold (2013) . The banana African climbing mouse Dendromus messorius was recorded by three specimens from the Field Museum from Dundo in the extreme north-east Angola collected by A. Barros Machado in 1948, but there are no known records close to this (Monadjem et al. 2015) . We suspect this is a misidentification, and it is interesting that Hayman (1963) commented on a series of five Dendromus from the Dundo Museum as follows: \"This unstriped Dendromys of the Lubda District appears to represent ansorgei rather than messorius Thomas of the Cameroons, under which name Sanborn (1952) listed a series from the Dundo region examined by him\". Since ansorgei is a synonym of mystacalis, it seems very likely that specimens from Dundo refer to the chestnut African climbing mouse D. mystacalis. Vernay's African climbing mouse D. vernayi is endemic to the central highlands of Angola and only known from the type locality. The monotypic Dendroprionomys (velvet climbing mouse) is known only from the type locality Brazzaville which is close to Cabinda and may be shown to occur there. The long-eared mouse Malacothrix typica was not recorded in the GBIF database but is known from extreme south-west Angola (Hill and Carter 1941; De Graaff 1981) .",

The C. denti record was an undated record from the Natural History Museum with no recorded locality. The C. silacea record was from the Field Museum of Natural History, collected in 1954 from near Quela in north Angola by G. H. Heinrich. Given its location many hundreds of kilometers from other known records, and difficulties in identification of this species, we believe this to be a misidentification and this record is regarded as highly dubious. The heather shrew C. erica and the blackish shrew C. nigricans are both endemic to Angola. Ansell's shrew C. ansellorum and the moonshine shrew C. luna have both been collected from the border region of Zambia and Angola, and probably occur in Angola.",

Throughout most of the twentieth century, Angola was largely neglected in terms of mammal research, particularly during the period of the civil war in the late twentieth century , but recent decades have seen renewed research efforts. For example, through the National Geographic Okavango Wilderness Project, acoustic, camera trap and trapping surveys carried out between 2015 and 2017 in the upper Okavango catchment, a previously neglected area, has added valuable new data on mammal occurrences. While estimates of bat species richness for the upper Okavango catchment based on combined acoustic and capture data from our study (33 species) correspond closely with predicted bat diversity for the region based on modelling studies (e.g., Herkt et al. 2016 ), our survey under-estimated non-volant small mammals species richness (13 species compared to 42 species predicted based on GBIF records for the central Angola plateau). Rodrigues et al. (2015) identified four biogeographical subdivisions in Angola based mostly on ungulate distributions. In the north, the Zaire-Lunda-Cuanza region was mainly associated with Congolian forests. In the south, the Namibe and Cunene-Cuando Cubango regions were mainly characterized by ungulates widespread in south-western and southern Africa. In between these regions, the Central Plateau region was mainly characterized by a few widespread ungulate species that are relatively common in dense miombo woodlands. These patterns were largely determined by a north-south gradient of decreasing humidity, from mesic tropical forests in the north to savannas and then more arid regions in the south. Patterns corresponding to this rainfall gradient are also evident in bats (Monadjem et al. 2010 ) and rodents (Monadjem et al. 2015) . Angolan is known for a fairly high number of endemic or near-endemic species, particularly in the case of rodents and shrews, where our study identified one shrew and six rodents endemic to the central and western Angolan highlands. The western escarpment Afromontane forests of Angola are particularly important as a centre of both species richness and endemism of plants and vertebrates including mammals (Carleton et al. 2015) . We suggest that future work should target more intensive surveys of small mammals in the central and western Angolan highlands to verify the presence and conservation status of threatened and/or endemic small mammal taxa.",

Although the Cuito-Okavango River trip of 2015 extended beyond Angola into Namibia and Botswana, there were no species identified in Namibia and Botswana that were not also detected in Angola. Matching of calls with species was based on release calls from bats captured and released in Angola (for Laephotis angolensis, Neoromicia capensis, Pipistrellus rusticus and N. zuluensis) as well as Monadjem et al. 2010a, Happold and Happold 2013, Taylor et al. 2013a and unpublished data from PJT and AM. Known occurrence of species in Angola is shown based on previous evidence from specimens (based on the current survey,GBIF records or listed as such byMonadjem et al. 2010)  or only from the literature. The occurrence of a species is shown as \"predicted\" where records are known from adjacent countries and high probabilities of occurrence were indicated for any part of Angola in Maximum Entropy Modeling (MaxEnt for short) species models depicted inMonadjem et al. (2010a). R = River.",
