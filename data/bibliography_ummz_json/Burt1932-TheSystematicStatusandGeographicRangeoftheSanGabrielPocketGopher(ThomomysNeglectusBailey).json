Dickey collection at the California Institute of Technology, I noticed that certain specimens from Mount Pinos, Kern County, California, labeled Thomomys bottae pascalis Merriam, differed perceptibly from topotypes of that race taken at Fresno, California. Bailey, in his revision of the genus Thomomys (North Amer. Fauna, no. 39, 1915, p. 54) , listed specimens from Mount Pinos under T. b. pascalis, and in his remarks under that species stated that \"Specimens from Tehachapi, Old Fort Tejon, and San Emigdio Canyon and Mount Pinos, at the south end of the San Joaquin Valley, vary from typical pascalis in smaller bullae and larger auditory meatus, showing probable intergradation with bottae of the adjoining chaparral-covered ranges.\" Upon comparison of the Mount Pinos specimens with Thomomys botiae bottae, T. bottae pallescens, and T. bottae mohaueneis from the lowlands, and T. neglectus from the San Gabriel Mountains, it was found that they did not agree with any of the lowland forms of bottae, but were similar both in skin and skull characters to neglectus. Inasmuch as no comparisons between neglectus and pascalis were made in the original description of neglectus (Proc. BioI. Soc. Washington, vol. 27, p. 117, July 10, 1914) nor in Bailey's revision of the pocket gophers (op. cit., pp. 65-66), a short comparison of the two forms may not be amiss. In coloration neglectus is, on the average, distinctly more grayish (less fulvous) than pascalis and the pelage is noticeably softer to the touch (this varies somewhat with the season, summer-taken specimens being less grayish in color and having a some-",
