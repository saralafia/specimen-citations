This cannot be accomplished by examining a single taxonomic group, as communities comprise a plethora of interactions across species and trophic levels. Here, we examine the patterns and relationships among plant, mammal, and bird diversity in Madagascar, a hotspot of biodiversity and endemism, across taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional axes. We found that plant community diversity and structure are shaped by geography and climate, and have significant influences on the taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity of mammals and birds. Patterns of primate diversity, in particular, were strongly correlated with patterns of plant diversity. Furthermore, our findings suggest that plant and animal communities could become more phylogenetically and functionally clustered in the future, leading to homogenization of the flora and fauna. These results underscore the importance and need of multi-taxon approaches to conservation, given that even small threats to plant diversity can have significant cascading effects on mammalian and avian community diversity, structure, and function.",

However, species do not exist in vacuum, and different groups may influence each other's diversity through various biotic interactions, such as trophic cascades (Reiss et al. 2009 , Cardinale et al. 2012 . In particular, plant diversity has been demonstrated to influence animal diversity in terrestrial ecosystems Porter 2003, Haddad et al. 2009) , as most animal species are largely dependent upon plants for key resources (e.g. shelter, food). Along these lines, it has been shown that communities with a higher diversity of plant species display higher productivity and provide a greater quantity of resources for consumers (Tilman et al. 2001) . However, sufficient evidence of these associations at large scales is lacking Porter 2003, Hawkins and Pausas 2004) . Such knowledge can provide useful insights for understanding the consequences of diversity loss at the producer level on associated consumer species (Haddad et al. 2009) .",

Considering phylogenetic and functional diversity in addition to taxonomic diversity enables the inference of processes that underpin biodiversity across multiple axes (Safi et al. 2011 , Swenson 2011 , Daru et al. 2017 ) and can provide a better framework for explaining potential linkages between plant diversity and animal diversity (Swenson 2011 , Schuldt et al. 2014 . For example, phylogenetic and/or functional clustering of species may indicate environmental filtering, whereas overdispersion can point to competition driving community assembly (Webb et al. 2002 , Cavender-Bares et al. 2009 , but see Mayfield and Levine 2010) .",

The geopolitical regions of Madagascar tend to largely correspond to bioclimatic zones. We expected that communities in harsher, resource poor environments, which impose strong environmental filters, such as the dry spiny forests in western Madagascar, would display higher phylogenetic clustering compared to more resource rich environments. We then identified the extent to which plant diversity explains mammalian and avian diversity in Madagascar. We expected that areas harboring high levels of plant diversity also host similarly high degrees of animal diversity across taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional scales. Finally, we explored how these patterns of diversity may change with species extinctions and biological invasions. We predicted that the continued loss of native species, and the introduction of invasive ones, will further degrade Malagasy ecosystems and alter patterns of diversity and community structure. Our datasets comprise a total of 11 642 species of vascular plants, 205 species of mammals, and 234 species of birds, representing the most comprehensive examination of the biodiversity in Madagascar to date. We uncover both commonalities and differences in patterns of, and threats to, plant and animal diversity. Our study further demonstrates relationships between plant and animal diversity and structure, underlining the importance of multi-taxon approaches to conservation.",

The island is characterized by geographic and climatic variability, with a broad east-west divide (Tattersall and Sussman 1975, Ganzhorn et al. 1997) . The east comprises high-elevation humid evergreen forests and a coastal belt that is mostly rainy year-round, while the west comprises lower elevation dry deciduous forests (Du Puy and Moat 2003, Jury 2003 ). Madagascar's 6 provinces and 22 regions encompass 5 bioclimatic zones and a network of protected areas (Fig. 1a,  b ). Madagascar's bioclimatic zones comprise humid, subhumid, montane, dry, and subarid environments with distinct geographic features and vegetation patterns (Humbert 1955 , Cornet 1974 , Schatz 2000 . These five broad climatic zones have been widely adopted and incorporated in numerous insightful taxonomic, evolutionary, ecological, conservation and biogeographic studies (Megson et al. 2009 , Buerki et al. 2010 , Irwin et al. 2010 , Brown et al. 2014 , Blair et al. 2015 , Vieilledent et al. 2016 , Crowley et al. 2017 , Wahlert et al. 2017 . Although the montane bioclimate is fairly limited in area ( Fig. 1a ), we consider it as a distinct bioclimatic zone in our analyses because nearly 20% of the taxa in our datasets occur in this zone.

                "text": "Assessments of biodiversity depend upon reliable species distribution data. However, fine-scale, comprehensive presence-absence data are unavailable for many of the plants, mammals, and birds of Madagascar. Furthermore, point occurrence (presence) data are often subject to numerous biases and uncertainties (Meyer et al. 2016 , Park and Davis 2017 , Daru et al. 2018 . Thus, to accurately infer patterns of biodiversity and community structure, we generated presence-absence matrices at the scale of administrative provinces (n = 6) and regions (n = 22), using species checklists, documented observations, and verified range distributions. These data can be subject to biases as well, but are more comprehensive (i.e. less missing data), and are often verified and supported by surveys, natural history collections, and literature, much of which have not been mobilized in online databases in the form of point occurrence records. We gathered information on the distribution of Malagasy vascular plants from the Missouri Botanical Garden's catalogue of the plants of Madagascar (Madagascar catalogue 2017, < www.efloras.org/madagascar >). The Catalogue is a work in progress, but represents the most comprehensive database of Malagasy vascular flora to date (Callmander et al. 2013) . For each species listed, we supplemented the information on their ranges using records of species occurrence within Madagascar from global biodiversity information facility (GBIF, < www.gbif.org/ >). We excluded records with coordinates failing to match the locality description, and those of species that were not included in the catalogue. We obtained range distributions for mammals from the international union for conservation of nature (IUCN, < www.iucnredlist.org/ >), and range distributions for birds from BirdLife International and NatureServe (BirdLife International and NatureServe 2015). These datasets were subject to further cleaning to remove duplicate records and to correct taxonomic inconsistencies. In total, we assembled data for 11 642 vascular plant species (including 9082 native endemics and 433 naturalized species), 205 mammal species and 234 bird species (animal species list in Supplementary material Appendix 1 Table A1 ). Species were categorized by their IUCN endangerment status, where threatened species were defined as those that were 'Critically Endangered' (CR), 'Endangered' (EN), or 'Vulnerable' (VU) (IUCN Red list, < www.iucnredlist.org/ >).",

PD, SES.MPD) using the 'PhyloMeasures' (Tsirogiannis and Sandel 2016) package in R ver. 3.2.0 (R Core Team). Standardized effect sizes account for effects of species richness, and are calculated as: (observed value -expected value) / standard deviation of the expected value. Expected values of PD and MPD were calculated from a null distribution of 1000 random assemblages of species drawn without replacement from the species pool of Malagasy taxa. The identities of species within communities were randomized but species number was held constant. Positive values of SES.PD and SES.MPD indicate phylogenetic overdispersion, whereas negative values indicate clustering. In order to examine how the compositions of communities in different areas vary, we also estimated the beta diversity versions of these metrics, with the addition of Sorenson's similarity index, which represents the taxonomic turnover and/or nestedness between communities (S\u00f8rensen 1948 , Harrison et al. 1992 , Baselga 2010 . We repeated these analyses for Madagascar's five bioclimatic zones (i.e. humid, subhumid, montane, dry and subarid). In addition to the overall diversity of vascular plants, mammals, and birds in Madagascar, we also examined angiosperms and primates separately as these monophyletic groups represent the vast majority of Malagasy vascular plants and mammals, respectively. Migratory and non-migratory birds were also examined separately, because they have been shown to exhibit contrasting phylogenetic signals in their behavior and ecology (Barnagaud et al. 2014) .",

The multivariate trait distances required to compute this index were calculated using Gower's distance, which can accommodate continuous, ordinal and nominal data (Podani and Schmera 2006) . We standardized continuous trait variables to center on zero with a unit standard deviation. FD values were calculated in R using the package picante and ade4 (Dray and Dufour 2007, Kembel et al. 2010) . We also examined how the observed values of FD deviate from random expectations, by calculating standardized effect sizes of FD. Null expectations were estimated from 9999 randomly generated communities, using the 'richness' option implemented in the package 'picante' (Kembel et al. 2010) in R (in which the identities of species within communities were randomized but species number was maintained). The species pool from which null communities were drawn comprised all taxa in Madagascar. While animal functional diversity may be influenced by plant functional diversity (Kissling et al. 2008) , we were unable to examine such relationships in this study because plant functional trait data are unavailable for the majority of plant species present in Madagascar.",

                "text": "Different groups of organisms displayed contrasting patterns of phylogenetic community structure. As with patterns of species diversity, plant community structure was highly influenced by climate. Plant communities in dry and subarid habitats tended to be phylogenetically clustered. The western dry deciduous forests and spiny thickets are subject to harsher selection pressures of a seasonal climate with an extended dry season (Ganzhorn et al. 1997 , Razafindratsima et al. 2013 . Environmental filtering may thus facilitate the occurrence of relatively closely related species that are adapted to drier climates (Lebrija-Trejos et al. 2010 , Razafindratsima et al. 2013 , Park and Potter 2015a . This pattern holds true at deeper nodes (SES.PD) as well as shallower ones (SES.MPD). The patterns in humid and subhumid regions were more complex. Taking into account the observed species richness, some provinces and regions in humid and subhumid areas represented less phylogenetic diversity than expected by random chance (SES.PD). At the same time, the values of MPD and SES.MPD are higher in these areas, displaying phylogenetic overdispersion. This suggests that while plant communities in the subhumid and humid lowland forests are somewhat phylogenetically clustered overall, very close relatives (e.g. sister species) tend to not co-occur. Thus, phylogenetic clustering is present at the deeper nodes, but not at the shallower nodes. This separation indicates the presence of broad environmental filtering coupled with more local effects of competition. Tropical rainforests have been shown to promote the coexistence of diverse organisms (Valladares et al. 2015) , and phylogenetic overdispersion has been reported in angiosperm tree communities in the tropics of Africa and Madagascar (Carlucci et al. 2017) .",

First, at the regional scale, differences in the composition of plants and animals are not as pronounced as when comparing provinces, since we are comparing smaller areas that are often closer on average in terms of geography, climate, and as a result, species composition. In addition, while plant species are not mobile, animals can migrate to nearby regions that provide sufficient resources and climate. Second, it could be possible that general climate, in addition to trophic interactions and mutualisms, is driving correlations of plant and animal turnover. With the exception of the northern province, Antsiranana, provinces tend to largely correspond to distinct bioclimatic zones, while many regions can occur in the same bioclimatic zone. Finally, our sample size is relatively small and thus it may be difficult to accurately detect correlations.",

                "text": "While our analyses are correlative, and thus cannot infer causality, it is reasonable to assume that given the close ties between plant species and the animals that rely on them, the diversity and composition of plant communities is likely to determine, in part, which animal species co-occur (Watson et al. 2004 , Scott et al. 2006 , Ballhorn et al. 2016 , Herrera 2016 ). In particular, patterns of mammal diversity were strongly associated with plant diversity. The majority of mammal species in Madagascar are arboreal primates that rely heavily on plants for food and habitat. Thus, their distributions are more likely to be structured around plant richness and diversity. Indeed, we find that changes in the composition of primate communities track changes in angiosperm community composition and phylogenetic turnover especially well. Primate communities have been shown to be influenced by temporal changes in climate (and by proxy, vegetation) more closely than other mammals in Africa (Rowan et al. 2016) , and the diversification of primate clades has been attributed to primates' mutualistic interactions with plant taxa (G\u00f3mez and Verd\u00fa 2012) . This is also supported by the fact that we find positive correlations between the phylogenetic clustering (SES.MPD) of plant communities and mammal communities. These associations are likely driven in part by diet. Differences in the diet and species composition of primate communities in drier vs wetter habitats have been reported (Ganzhorn 1998 , Kamilar 2009 . The dry, lower elevation habitats have lower fruit availability, and primates in these areas tend to consume more leaves (Ossi and Kamilar 2006) . Among primate dietary traits, folivory has been found to exhibit the strongest connection to phylogeny, possibly due to the need for specialized morphological features for processing leaves (Kamilar and Cooper 2013) . Thus, the phylogenetically clustered dry forests of the west comprise less overdispersed mammal communities that rely on leaves for much of their diet, while the overdispersed, plant species-rich humid forests of the east provide a diversity of food sources to a wider phylogenetic range of mammal species. Indeed, high vascular plant richness, diversity, and overdispersion corresponded to high mammal functional diversity, indicating that diverse plant communities attract an array of functionally diverse mammals that utilize them. Assessing plant functional traits, and examining how their diversity directly affects those of animal taxa in Madagascar, would be an invaluable next step. Similar to other systems (Kissling et al. 2008 , Zellweger et al. 2017 , we also found that bird community patterns in Madagascar were affected by certain metrics of plant diversity. The lack of correlation of certain plant diversity patterns and bird functional diversity may be due to the larger ranges and mobility of avian taxa, which enable them to utilize resources from distant habitats. It may also be due to the large proportion of carnivorous bird species on the island (58%). Plant diversity has been shown to have strong bottom-up effects on trophic interactions, affecting taxa at lower trophic levels more so than carnivorous taxa, whose density and richness is independent of vegetation structure (Scherber et al. 2010) . Interestingly, the degree of phylogenetic clustering in bird communities differed in its relationship with the degree of clustering in plant communities depending on migratory status. Both the phylogenetic structure of migratory bird communities and their compositions tended to strongly correspond to those of plant communities (Supplementary material Appendix 1 Fig. A3 ). However, non-migratory birds did not follow patterns of plant species turnover, and the phylogenetic clustering of non-migratory birds was negatively affected by the clustering of plants in a region. The evolution of migratory behavior is associated with low flexibility in habitat, nesting phenology and physiological constraints (B\u00f6hning-Gaese et al. 1998) . Thus, migratory birds may be more likely to track plant diversity patterns than their non-migratory counterparts. More in-depth examinations of bird species and their habitat requirements are needed along these lines.",

Madagascar has already lost up to 80% of its primary vegetation (Harper et al. 2007) and at least 34 large endemic vertebrate species (Pedrono et al. 2013) . Currently, 1076 vascular plant species, 115 mammal species and 33 bird species are on the brink of extinction (IUCN 2017) . We demonstrate that the potential extinction of these threatened taxa will increase the overall degree of phylogenetic clustering present in natural communities. We also show that the loss of threatened animals will significantly decrease current animal functional diversity, potentially affecting key ecosystem functions and services (Flynn et al. 2009 (Flynn et al. , 2011 . Such loss of animal functional diversity could also negatively impact plant diversity, especially given that frugivorous primates play critical roles in structuring plant communities in Madagascar Dunham 2015, 2016) .",

These invasive plant species are on average more closely related to the natives than the natives are amongst themselves, suggesting environmental filtering is driving the establishment of exotic aliens Potter 2013, 2015a, b) . Thus, further introduction and spread of invasive species are likely to further increase the phylogenetic clustering of plant communities. Additionally, climate change is predicted to increase aridity across Madagascar (Supplementary material Appendix 2), which may not only increase the clustering of plant communities, but will decrease their overall diversity and richness as well, based on our findings that drier climates tend to house more clustered, depauperate plant communities. As plant community diversity and structure is intertwined with those of animals, the combination of species loss, biological invasions, and climate change will have cascading effects on migratory birds and mammals (primates in particular), decreasing the phylogenetic and functional diversity present in communities. More than 90% of the Malagasy primate species are already threatened with extinction (IUCN 2017), making this a major concern.",

We also demonstrate that conservation efforts focusing on single groups of taxa may not be sufficient, and that even small threats to plant diversity can have intertwining effects on mammalian and avian community diversity, structure, and function. However, our current knowledge of biodiversity patterns is far from complete, and subject to potential sampling biases, necessitating finer-scale examinations as more high-quality data become available. Nonetheless, our broad findings emphasize the importance of taking a multi-faceted approach and considering species interactions and evolutionary relationships in examining biodiversity patterns and emphasize the need of comprehensive biodiversity studies for efficient conservation.",
