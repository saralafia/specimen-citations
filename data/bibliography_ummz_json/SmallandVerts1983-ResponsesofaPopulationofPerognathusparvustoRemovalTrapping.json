French et al. (1968) recorded dispersal movements in four species of heteromyids but reported sex and age characteristics only for Perognathus formosus. Schroder and Rosenzweig (1975) found populations of two species of Dipodomys contained large numbers of transients that quickly replaced residents removed. They did not report ages of residents, those removed, or immigrants, but they suggested that both sexes \"were equally prone to move about\" (p. 22), The apparent paucity of information on sex and age characteristics of resident and immigrant heteromyids prompted us to attempt to ascertain the dispersal strategy for a population of Great Basin pocket mice (Perognathus parvus).",

Other vegetation on the study plot consisted of 'icattered cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), buckwheat (Eriogonum sp.), Sandberg bluegrass (Foa secunda), and matchweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae) On 30 June 1980, 100 Sherman live traps were set in a 10-by lO-station grid with IS m between stations. Traps, baited with rolled oats and set on 15 consecutive evenings, were examined and dosed each morning. Sex, weight to the nearest 1.0 g, and the toe-dip mark used to distinguish each individual were recorded; P. parous that weighed 14 g or less were considered juveniles, Animals caught during the first 7 days were released at their respective points of capture; by 7 days, the proportion of unmarked individuals in the daily catch approached an asymptote suggesting that most residents were marked ( Fig. 1 )_ In an attempt to speed removal of residents, an additional trap was set at each station on days 8, 9, and 10. On day 8, all mice captured, both marked and unmarked, were considered residents and were removed from the study area; on days 9 and 10, only mice marked during the first 7 days were removed, and newly captured mice were marked and released as before. During days 11-15, newly-captured animals were marked and released as before the removal period.",

The latter situation would be more common on study plots such as ours where a large proportion of traps were occupied each night because of the relatively dense population. If a large proportion of the population were prevented from entering traps either because traps were occupied already or because of scent marks left at traps by behaviorally dominant individuals (Summerlin and Wolfe, 1973) , the addition of 100 traps should have revealed this otherwise inconspicious portion of the population even if there were initial avoidance of the newly placed traps. Yet, few mice were caught in traps added during the removal phase even though increasing numbers of unmarked mice were trapped immediately after commencing removal (Table 2 ). In addition, the proportion of unmarked mice caught on days 9, 10, and 11 composed of adult, and presumably dominant, individuals (Summerlin and Wolfe, 1973) was greater than caught later in the postremoval period; thus, we suggest that the unmarked mice that appeared in the catch immediately after removal trapping, indeed, were immigrants.",

During the 7-day preremoval period, 49 (82%) of 60 pocket mice caught three or more times and 22 (79%) of 28 caught twice did not move more than one between-station interval. The nearly identical proportions that did not move more than one between-station interval (X\" = 0.121, d.L = 1) suggests that P. parvus populations may not contain a similar transient component. During days 9-15, 38 (72%) of 53 previously unmarked mice caught three or more times did not move more than one between-station interval, suggesting that immigrants established residence quickly.",

In Ollr study, the initial influx after removal was comprised of nearly equal numbers of adults and juveniles, and later immigrants were so predominantly juvenile that the entire postremoval sample was biased toward juveniles. Whether the dispersal strategy of our population of P. parvus was truly uniquE' or derived its apparent uniqueness from other investigators failing to analyze for temporal shifts in age ratios among immigrants is uncertain.",
