Wild, pregnant females were captured and brought to the laboratory, where the size, weight, and sexual composition of their litters were recorded. Females that experienced unusually warm springtime temperatures in the field during early pregnancy gave birth to approximately 0.4 more young per litter than other females, and female embryos appeared to be most strongly affected. Females experiencing warm temperatures in the autumn gave birth to approximately 0.5 fewer young than other females in that season, with male embryos most affected. Exposure to heavy rainfall (over 0.1\" in 24 h) during early pregnancy in any season also cost females approximately 0.5 young per pregnancy. Young born to mothers exposed to rainfall weighed 7-9% less than young in other litters. Unusually cold temperatures did not affect the mean number of young born per litter, but reduced the variance in litter size by selecting against especially large and small litters. Laboratory exposure of newly impregnated females to 12 h of high temperatures (33-35\u00b0C) led to decreased litter size, but the embryonic sex most affected depended on the timing of exposure. Male embryos suffered the greatest losses when pregnant females were exposed just after implantation of their litters, whereas earlier exposure led to mortality of female embryos.",

                "text": "Variation in characteristics of mammalian litters such as number of young, size of young, and sex ratio are usually attributed either to genetic differences among populations as a result of natural selection on reproductive performance (e.g., reviews by Eisenberg, 1981; Millar, 1977 for number and size of young; Williams, 1979 for sex ratio) or related to qualities of mothers such as their age, parity, and weight (e.g., Myers and Master, 1983 ). Here we report the results of field and laboratory investigations to test the hypothesis that a third class of factors, the immediate environment experienced by pregnant females (represented by ambient temperature and rainfall), can also influence the size and sexual composition of litters of prairie deer mice, Peromyscus 11Ulniculatus bairdit. We also consider whether this variation represents an adaptive response by wild female mice to short-term environmental fluctuations.",

The gestation period of nonlactating females, or females whose previous Inter is removed at birth, is 23 days (Layne, 1968; Myers and Master, 1983) , with implantation occurring 3-5 days after conception unless delayed by lactation (Layne, 1968) . Females that are lactating when they conceive usually delay implantation from 1 day to a week or more (Myers and Master, 1983) . The length of the postimpiantation period, however, is probably fairly constant and lasts 16-18 days (Layne, 1968) . Therefore,",

Temperature and rainfall recorded at a weather station are expected to be correlated imperfectly with the conditions actually experienced by mice. Nevertheless, use of these data is unlikely to result in falsely positive results (i.e., demonstration of an effect when none exists). Further, microclimatic differences within the home range of an individual mouse are probably large enough so that more accurate measurement of weather could only be made by exact knowledge of a mouse's position and microclimate at all times.

The variance in litter size in spring, however, was much reduced in litters exposed to low temperatures compared to litters not so exposed (method 3; Fig. 1 ). The difference was highly significant (P < 0.001, F = 3.117, d.f. = 95,30) and suggested that mortality in the smallest and largest litters correlated with exposure to cold. Heavy rain during both seasons led to reduced litter sizes ( Table 3) . The difference was strongly significant statistically when spring litters from all years were examined simultaneously, and significant (1976) or in the right direction (1980 and 1982) for the other years for which testable samples were available. Two-way analyses of variance, performed to test for an interaction between temperature and rainfall, revealed no significant interaction terms (rainfall x temperature: spring and autumn; number of male young, number of female young, litter size, and sex ratio. in each case (eight tests, P > 0.15).",

Exposure to unusually cold temperatures (as defined above) had no detectable effect on the mean number of young, but in the spring appeared to be correlated with reduced variance in litter size (Fig. 1) . Rainfall and rapidly rising autumn temperatures also tended to be associated with small young, in spite of the general trend in this species for smaller litters to be composed of larger young (Myers and Master, 1983) . These results were obtained in spite of three sources of error that tend to mask any effect of field conditions on wild mice. (1) The weather records used in the analyses were taken from a weather station up to 15 km from the most distant field. These records are certainly correlated imperfectly with the microclimates experienced by mice, as noted above. (2) The laboratory experiments described above suggest that the timing of exposure to high temperature following conception may be critical. Due to delayed implantation in lactating females, the date of conception of wild-conceived litters was not known; as a result, two females, each, for example, 17 days before the birth of their litters, may have conceived on different dates, and therefore may have different susceptibilities to environmental stress. Thus, some females in the sample of females exposed on days 17-23 probably were in a phase of development sensitive to stress, while others were not. (3) Laboratory work on domestic animals has shown that exposure to heat sometimes leads to failure of gametogenesis or the loss of entire litters (e.g., Yamauchi et aI., 1981;  this was not seen, however, in our experiments). Wild females that had failed-to ovulate or had aborted or resorbed entire litters could not be distinguished from other nonpregnant females. If present, this kind of extreme mortality was missed entirely in our treatment of field observations. No significant differences in any reproductive parameter were found when fixed cutoff points were used for all days to define hot and cold temperatures. This finding, contrasted with a considerable effect when methods 2 or 3 were used, suggests that acclimatization to changing environmental temperatures is probably important in determining a litter's sensitivity to environmental temperature.",

Method 3 emphasizes sensitivity to rapid change irrespective of \"expected\" temperatures.

Under either of these conditions a female might profit by terminating her present attempt to reproduce, and awaiting more favorable conditions. The benefit of this behavior to females would be increased if embryonic mortality occurred early in gestation, so that a female lost relatively little investment through each embryo dying, and if she were able to compensate the cost of a lowered litter size through increased future ovulation rate, or, in a different sense, larger young (Myers and Master, 1983) .",

We found no or slight effect of extreme field temperatures experienced early in gestation by Peromyscus embryos, except for those experiencing rapid increases in temperature during the autumn. These young tended to be lighter than those in other litters, despite a simultaneous decrease in litter size. Similarly, exposure to rainfall in excess of 0.1\" during early pregnancy appeared to result in both smaller and fewer young.

In our study present temperature trends were poor predictors of future ones; not surprisingly, the deviation of the maximum temperature on a given day from the smoothed mean, for example, is only weakly correlated with the deviations 10-20 days in the future (P > 0.10 in most cases; calculated for each season from [1976] [1977] [1978] [1979] [1980] . Females might, however, use climatic conditions in early gestation to predict future resources or habitat suitability (e.g., Field and Blankenship, 1973; Hoditschek and Best, 1983; Ojeda et aI., 1982) . Rain in SE Michigan, for example, usually signals increased growth of ground cover, leading to conditions poorly suited to species such as P. m. bairdii that favor more open habitat (Master, 1977, who further observed that spring rainfall was significantly, inversely correlated with the density of deer mouse populations in the summer and autumn). Another possible adaptive significance of embryonic mortality is suggested by a female's ability to control (to some extent) her microclimate. If, for example, it were to a female's advantage to invest heavily in male offspring (or not invest in females), she could do so by seeking out a warm microclimate soon after mating. On the other hand, embryonic mortality may simply be an unavoidable penalty to females unluckily pregnant at the wrong time. Environmental conditions probably often operate indirectly on reproduction through their immediate effect on nutrition (Van der Merwe and Skinner, 1982) . They may have other, more direct, effects, however. In an artificial setting, Gunn and Doney (1973) found that non-nutritional environmental factors (including simulated heavy rainfall) led to reduced ovulation and increased embryo loss in ewes. If present, such mortality would represent strong selection on female P. m. bairdii to avoid breeding during unusually warm periods (perhaps explaining the midsummer \"lull\" in breeding sometimes reported for this species; Howard, 1949) , or to seek areas of favorable microclimate (placing a premium on well-buffered nest sites and affecting daily patterns of activity).",
