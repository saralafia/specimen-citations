    "abstract": "Over eight kilobases (kb) of sequence from eight genes including two mitochondrial loci, Cyt b and 12S, and six nuclear loci, B2m , Zp3 , Tcp1, Sry, Smcx and Smcy , were used to investigate phylogenetic relationships among 11 taxa representing eight species within the rodent genus Mus. Particular attention was given to discerning relationships among species within the subgenus Mus including members of a Palearctic clade (M. musculus , M. spicilegus , M. macedonicus and M. spretus) and members of an Asian clade (M. caroli , M. cookii and M. cervicolor), as previous studies using different datasets have produced different topologies for taxa within these two groups. While parsimony analyses of the combined eight-gene dataset yielded a single, fully resolved tree, support values were lower for nodes resolving relationships within the Palearctic and Asian clades than they were elsewhere in the tree. In addition, a maximum likelihood analysis of the same eight-gene dataset yielded different topologies for both the Palearctic and the Asian clades. Both observations are indicative of clade instability. The nature of this instability was explored through a comparison with our previous study in which we included the two mitochondrial loci and only four of the six nuclear genes, and through an analysis of partitioned data, specifically mitochondrial vs. nuclear genes. This study underscores the importance of considering among-site rate variation in phylogeny reconstruction.",

                "text": "The rodent genus Mus (family Muridae, subfamily Murinae), comprising approximately 30-40 species of mice (Musser & Carleton, 1993) , has been the subject of numerous phylogenetic investigations over the last two decades (see Berry & Scriven, 2005, this issue) . These studies focused primarily on taxa in the subgenus Mus and incorporated comparative data from allozymes (Sage, 1981; Bonhomme et al ., 1984; She et al ., 1990) , mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) (Ferris et al ., 1983; She et al ., 1990) , RFLPs of nuclear rDNA spacer regions (Suzuki & Kurihara, 1994) , single-copy nuclear DNA (scnDNA) hybridization (She et al ., 1990; Catzeflis & Denys, 1992; Chevret, Jenkins & Catzeflis, 2003) , mtDNA sequences (Fort et al ., 1984; Sourrouille et al ., 1995; Prager, Tichy & Sage, 1996; Prager, Orrego & Sage, 1998; Lundrigan, Jansa & Tucker, 2002; Chevret et al. , 2003) and nuclear sequences (Jouvin-Marche et al ., 1988; Lundrigan & Tucker, 1994; Lundrigan et al ., 2002; Auffray et al ., 2003) . species are due to rate differences (Lundrigan et al ., 2002) . Unlike each one of the nuclear genes, Cyt b is evolving rapidly enough to contribute a considerable number of informative characters to resolve relationships among these closely related taxa. However, the Cyt b data were homoplasious; for example, the sistergroup relationship between M. caroli and M. cookii in the mitochondrial parsimony tree was weakly supported. We concluded that homoplasy in one data partition, specifically Cyt b , may be obscuring phylogenetic signal in the combined data.",

The origins for all samples were provided in the appendix of our earlier study (Lundrigan et al., 2002) . Three of the species used in the earlier study were excluded from this study because additional sequence data from Smcx and Smcy were not available. All of the species are members of the rodent family Muridae and the subfamily Murinae, the Old-World mice and rats. Muridae is the largest mammalian family, containing 281 genera and 1326 species (Musser & Carleton, 1993) . The sister group to Mus is unknown, although there is evidence from DNA hybridization (Catzeflis & Denys, 1992; Chevret et al., 1994) and nuclear gene data (Jansa & Weksler, 2004) for a sistergroup relationship with the Praomys group.

Each analysis was initiated with random starting trees and was run for 2 \u00a5 10 6 generations, sampling every 100th generation. Four continuous chains were run. To check that stationarity had been reached, the fluctuating value of the likelihood was checked graphically. The initial 1000 trees were discarded as burn-in. The effective sample size of all parameters as determined in Tracer (Rambaut & Drummond, 2003) was greater than 100. This indicated that parameters were sampled appropriately. The simulation was conducted twice.",

However, there was no compelling evidence to support the hypothesis of a different history for the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes because the position of M. cervicolor as basal was weakly supported in the mitochondrial tree (bootstraps of 54% and 72% for maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony trees, respectively, Fig. 3 ). In the combined eight-gene parsimony tree ( Fig. 2A ) M. cervicolor was basal but bootstrap/Bremer support values (54%/1) were also low. In contrast, the basal position of M. caroli was more strongly supported in the eightgene likelihood tree (bootstrap of 85%, Fig. 2B ) and in the combined nuclear tree (bootstraps of 99% and 100% for maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony trees, respectively, Fig. 3 ). Because the mitochondrial gene Cytb contributed the greatest number of informative characters for any single gene, with transition substitutions, especially at first-and thirdposition sites, exhibiting considerable homoplasy (Table 1) , we explored the contribution of transition substitutions in Cytb to the phylogenetic signal through successive down-weighting in a combined eight-gene parsimony analysis. A slight decrease in weighting, from 1.0 to 0.9, resulted in the repositioning of M. caroli to a basal position in the Asian clade. This suggests instability for the topology in which M. caroli is sister to M. cookii in the eight-gene parsimony tree ( Fig. 2A ) and the two-gene mitochondrial tree (Fig. 3 ) and is consistent with the observed low bootstrap and Bremer support values for that arrangement in those two trees.",

The repositioning of M. spretus from a basal position within the Palearctic clade to a sister relationship with M. spicilegus/ M. macedonicus when transitions were downweighted from 0.9 to 0.3 is more difficult to interpret. While Cytb transition substitutions appeared largely responsible for the basal position of M. spretus in the Palearctic clade, this signal was congruent across Cytb and 12S as support values were high for this arrangement in the combined two-gene mitochondrial trees (bootstraps of 93 and 95% for maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony trees, respectively, Fig. 3 ). Two explanations for this observation can be given. First, there are real differences in the mitochondrial and nuclear genome histories for some of the Palearctic taxa. The difference in the position of M. spretus in the mitochondrial vs. nuclear trees could possibly result from historical introgression of nuclear genes between M. spretus and M. spicilegus/M. macedonicus, provided the ranges of these taxa overlapped historically; the range of M. spretus does not currently overlap with either M. spicilegus or M. macedonicus.",
