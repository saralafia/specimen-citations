An alternative strategy is to make wildlife an integral part of urban development and thereby create a new habitat in the built-up area. Here we address the challenge of choosing target species for such wildlife-inclusive urban design. The starting point of our conceptual framework is the regional species pool, which can be obtained from geo-referenced species data. The existing habitat types on and around the development site and dispersal barriers limit the species numbers to the local species potential. In the next step, the site's potential for each species is analyzed-how can it be upgraded to host species given the planned development and the life-cycle of the species? For the final choice of target species, traits related to the human-animal interaction are considered. We suggest that stakeholders will be involved in the final species selection. Our approach differs from existing practice, such as expert choice of priority species, by (1) representing an open process where many species are potential targets of conservation, (2) the involvement of stakeholders in a participatory way.

Indeed, many species frequently occur in cities and some species may even thrive in urban areas (e.g., peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus) [3] ). In addition, cities have often been built in naturally biodiverse areas [4, 5] . As humans and animals share common spaces, cities have an important role in the nature experience of city dwellers, including decision-makers [6] .

For new developments, the involvement of residents during target species selection is not possible, however, later involvement is crucial, e.g., through environmental education programs and stewardship. For redevelopment projects, residents can be already involved during target species selection to promote understanding and stewardship early on [29] .",

Here, we develop a framework for selecting target species for wildlife-inclusive urban design. It considers both ecological and socio-cultural criteria for development projects in the built environment. Our conceptual framework involves the use of big data, structured decision-making, expert opinion, and participative approaches. We believe that this framework can broaden the scope of conservation projects in the urban environment and make them more acceptable to city dwellers. The use of big data on species occurrences will increase the range of species that can be targeted including more common species that are declining in the urban environment, as well as rare species that would normally not be targeted. When a participatory approach is used, conservation projects are likely to meet with more support by city dwellers. This is different from most current conservation processes where only conservation experts decide on what species need to be prioritized. In our proposed approach, conservation experts can make suggestions, but the stakeholders ultimately decide on target species.",

This is because current species occurrences are often constrained by a lack of habitat features that could be added during development. Thus, it is the regional species pool, which can be obtained from geo-referenced species data, that needs to be searched when target species for a particular urban development project are sought. The available habitat types on and around the development site, the dispersal potential of species, barriers in the environment, and the living requirements of the species all limit the species number to the local species potential. For the final choice of target species, traits related to the human-animal interaction are considered. We suggest that experts, e.g., ecologists or environmental consultants, make some recommendations, but that there is a participatory process so that stakeholders will be involved in species selection (Figure 1 ).

Publicly available species monitoring data can be analyzed to create a list of species that have been recorded in the city of interest. Such data are available in most countries, even though the way such data are available differs from country to country and between regions within countries. Differences may occur with respect to which taxa are contained in the database, data sources and the information stored in each record. In Germany for example, the 16 German states (Bundesl\u00e4nder) each have their own database (or none), and differ widely in how and which species data are available, ranging from having no public database yet (state of Berlin), recording only certain vertebrate taxa (state Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg) to data on all taxa (e.g., Bavaria, Hamburg). In addition, there are global databases such as the Global Information Facility (GBIF) [30] , which offers a huge database of global species monitoring data. Other potential resources are data from authorities from a variety of sources, such as environmental impact assessments (EIAs), publicly funded monitoring schemes or volunteers, such as birders. With the rise in global, national and regional databases, such species occurrence data are becoming more and more available.

Differences may occur with respect to which taxa are contained in the database, data sources and the information stored in each record. In Germany for example, the 16 German states (Bundesl\u00e4nder) each have their own database (or none), and differ widely in how and which species data are available, ranging from having no public database yet (state of Berlin), recording only certain vertebrate taxa (state Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg) to data on all taxa (e.g., Bavaria, Hamburg). In addition, there are global databases such as the Global Information Facility (GBIF) [30] , which offers a huge database of global species monitoring data. Other potential resources are data from authorities from a variety of sources, such as environmental impact assessments (EIAs), publicly funded monitoring schemes or volunteers, such as birders. With the rise in global, national and regional databases, such species occurrence data are becoming more and more available. While such data are routinely used in research projects, e.g., to calculate species distribution maps for research on the effects of climate change, they are not frequently used for local conservation projects.",

First, there are those species that have been recorded close to the project site so that it appears likely for them to reach the site by their own means, assuming there are no dispersal barriers (species of the focal area). Second, there are species that have been recorded only further away from the project site, at a distance too far to reach it (species outside the focal area, Figure 3 ). To which of these categories a particular species belongs does not only depend on the location where it has been located, but also on its dispersal power. The distance a species can move varies between species and, in particular, between modes of dispersal. A species that can fly will be able to travel further than species that need to walk or to crawl. For migrating birds, for example, a distance of 50 km does not represent a challenge, except for migration barriers, while for a toad a distance of 1500 m may be the maximum it can disperse (e.g., [33] ). Thus, the focal area will be species-specific. To facilitate the analysis, we suggest to pool species of the same taxon and dispersal mode when deciding on the focal area. For example, a single circular focal area for all songbirds with a radius of 50 km around the project site, as well as a (separate) focal area for all amphibians with a radius of 2 km around the project site [34] .

Importantly, species of the regional species pool should not be discarded at this stage, even when they occur only outside their respective focal area. Indeed, these species may occur within the focal area but have not been recorded there (false absence data). We suggest to check whether the typical habitat of these species exists within the focal area. If so, there is the possibility that the species does, in fact, occur in the focal area and the species should be kept as a potential target species. For example, a species that has been recorded in remnants of small forest outside the focal area, but not in similar remnants within the focal area, should be kept as a potential target species, as it is possible that it was not recorded in these remnants due to lack of monitoring. Thus, in addition to point locations of species, it is necessary to use the information on the distribution of habitats in the area surrounding a project site. Again, such information is generally available but differs in quality and detail (see Figure 3 for an example). Whether or not such an approach is appropriate for a particular species will depend on how closely the species is associated with a particular habitat.",

Here, we need to distinguish between habitat requirements that cannot be achieved unless they are already present and conserved and those that could be implemented by the developer through landscaping. For example, old mature trees with cavities provide important habitat for birds, bats, and other mammals and arthropods in urban areas [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] , but cannot be provided if not already present. On the other hand, vegetation cover and structure, which are also important determinants of species richness and abundance of birds and arthropods in urban landscapes [10, 42, 43] , can be included in landscape plans. Which habitat structures are required depends on the life-cycle of the target species. For example, diet [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] , foraging mode and strata [51] [52] [53] , and the location of breeding and resting places [44] [45] [46] 48, 54] influence whether a species is able to live in a particular urban area. Another important factor to consider is pollution, including noise and light [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] .

In addition to these limitations imposed by the urban structure, species-specific traits also determine the ability of species to reach suitable habitat in urban areas. These include home range [47, 66] , dispersal ability [47, [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] and sensitivity towards barriers [47, 54, [71] [72] [73] .",

Still, not all of these species may be suitable target species as we have not yet considered the human factor, which is important in urban environments. To this end, the attitude of humans towards the species needs to be assessed. We suggest analyzing those species traits that determine the attitude of humans towards them. These include their observability, potential benefits that humans may derive from a species, and potential conflicts between a species and humans ( Table 2) . Consideration of these traits will further limit the number of species that can be chosen as target species. The final step is the participative selection of target species for the development, where stakeholder demands play an important role. Table 2 . Socio-cultural aspects to evaluate the relationship between animals and humans. Examples are given that may influence how well a species can be observed, of benefits that urban citizens may experience when interacting with animals, and of potential conflicts. Human perception of animals is complex and may elicit positive or negative feelings, like joy, but also fear and disgust [74] . In addition, some species are rated highly, because they provide important ecosystem services. For example, biodiversity may provide regulating ecosystem services, may contribute to the wellbeing of city dwellers [75] , or may have high cultural or symbolic value [76, 77] . On the other hand, disservices may also exist as some species, e.g., parasites or large carnivores, may impair human health or lead to dangerous encounters for humans [78, 79] . Some species may also be considered a nuisance because they are perceived as noisy or dirty [80] . Thus, human values limit the acceptance of urban nature. Not all animals that could live in the city for biological reasons are approved or tolerated by urban inhabitants. Rats or pigeons are generally undesired even though they can cope very well with the conditions in the city, while squirrels or small songbirds, for example, have a positive record [81] . Perception of species and the ability to identify them depend on the taxonomic group and on how evenly species are distributed, i.e., rare species and species hard to detect may not be perceived by most people [74, 82] . Species that are easy to perceive and observe, for example with colorful patterns, have a high recognition value and contribute to nature experience by urban citizens [83] . These considerations need to be taken into account when choosing target species for urban development projects, in order to maximize positive human-wildlife interactions and to minimize human-wildlife conflict. Three major aspects that influence human-wildlife interactions in urban areas emerge. These are (a) the observability of a species or taxonomic group, (b) potential benefits to human health and other ecosystem services and (c) potential conflicts or disservices ( Table 2) .",

Observability mainly includes outward species traits, such as size, color, patterns or song. Potential benefits of species or taxonomic groups consider positive effects on humans or open spaces and are classified into regulating and cultural benefits according to their function as ecosystem services. Conflicts explore potential negative effects of species or taxonomic groups on humans or open spaces. This also considers the potential of a species to elicit negative feelings in humans and attitudes towards different species [81] . At the end of this step, it should be clear which species may be generally better or less well-suited as target species for a project from a human point of view. Because this evaluation will depend on the cultural context in which the evaluation takes place, e.g., in Western Europe [84, 85] , but not necessarily on the specific urban development, this step needs to be done only once for each species and the results can be assembled in a database that can be used in further projects. Exceptions may be situations where the development concerns an area with a different or mixed cultural context, e.g., the building of an apartment block where tenants may also come from outside Europe, or the business site of a foreign, e.g., Asian company.

In a consequence table, the identified ecological, socio-cultural and project-specific requirements are unified to facilitate participatory target species selection (Table 4) . Specifically, the objectives of the project with respect to wildlife inclusion are listed and each species is evaluated according to predefined criteria. For example, economic feasibility is evaluated, e.g., what are the costs to implement and maintain specific habitat structures? In the context of wildlife-inclusive design, it is also important to consider potential conflicts between habitat structures required by certain species and humans using the open space, i.e., not only the species has to be desirable, but also its required habitat structures. At the same time, potential solutions for these conflicts should be offered, e.g., pollution of facades by birds may be avoided through the application of excrement boards. Color-coding can then be used to identify species that have been positively evaluated with respect to most objectives. These are the most promising target species. The final selection of target species is based on the consequence table and the involvement of all project stakeholders. In a final step the expert professionals that are in charge of the selection process, e.g., planning offices or nature conservation authorities, will select target species together with the developer and the project-specific stakeholders, such as residents, architects, maintenance companies or housing associations. The extent of participation will depend on the specific project. The main goal of participation within wildlife-inclusive design is to increase the acceptance of wildlife and necessary measures to support wildlife within urban areas. Whether participation will be successful in increasing the acceptance of wildlife-inclusive design will mainly depend on the degree of empowerment of stakeholders.",

The foundation for any kind of participation in the sharing of information. When participation remains at this level, it is also referred to as 'tokenism' as those affected are not able to contribute to the decision making itself. In the context of wildlife-inclusive urban design, this may include access to information about the functions of different habitat structures for target species. A further stage of participation is consultation, where stakeholders have the possibility to comment on plans. In the context of wildlife-inclusive urban design, the consequence table developed in the previous step may be discussed with the stakeholders, but the final selection of species would lie with the experts and the developer. The highest level of participation is reached when stakeholders can use the shared information to actively engage in decision-making or in joint development of ideas. For wildlife-inclusive urban design, this would mean the pros and cons of different species are not only discussed with stakeholders, but the final choice would be made jointly. As the scale and context of wildlife-inclusive urban design projects will vary, the realizable degree of participation may vary too. The degree of participation that can be realized in a specific project may also depend on the time scale of the project and its available budget. The participation of stakeholders goes beyond the overall coordination of the selection process with the developer, which is not considered participation in this context. Distinct expectations are often responsible for the failure of participation. While stakeholders often expect joint decision-making, those in power often equate participation with information sharing [90] . Therefore, to avoid conflicts and misunderstandings, it is necessary to be clear about the degree of participation early on.",

In addition, through structured decision making the pros and cons of different potential target species are transparently presented and based on objective and clear criteria. Thereby, stakeholders are given a true choice between different potential species and the best possible conditions for a successful agreement on a set of target species are given.

In these cases, post-construction information for example through educational programs may be applied [92] .",

Most habitat maps are based on vegetation types and do not necessarily reflect all habitat types that are relevant for animals. In addition, they often do not cover the whole city area, but only selected biotopes and traditional classifications may be inappropriate in urban environments [95] . New promising ways of capturing spatial heterogeneity of urban areas through remote sensing approaches have been proposed [96] . Whether they can predict the distribution of animals across urban landscapes still needs to be tested. Nevertheless, associations between land cover, block-scale vegetation, and bird communities have been found [28] .

The selection of the surveyed cities was based on the availability of monitoring data from local authorities and adjusted to represent a cross-section of different federal states. All records of animal occurrences in a circular buffer of 50 km around the project-sites were requested from federal authorities. If the area of investigation stretched across more than one federal state, data for these parts was requested from the local authorities respectively. Additionally, we downloaded publicly available animal records from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF, https://doi.org/10.15468/dl.dyw3ux) and requested data from the Arachnologische Gesellschaft e.V. (AraGes). Data from federal authorities and the AraGes cannot be published because of restriction set within the user agreement.",
