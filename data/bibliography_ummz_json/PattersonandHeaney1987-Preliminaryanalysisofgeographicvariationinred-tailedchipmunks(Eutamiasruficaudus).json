                "text": "The systematics of western chipmunks (subgenus Neotamias) has long been the subject of confusion and debate. Whereas other chipmunk subgenera are monotypic, extending over continent-sized areas with slight known differentiation, Neotamias is highly polytypic, with complex patterns of distribution and variation in western North America. Some 23 species of Neotamias are currently recognized (Callahan, 1980; Hall, 1981; Patterson, 1984) , although the rank of some taxa is contested (Levenson and Hoffmann, 1984; cf. Sutton and Nadler, 1974) . Chipmunk affinities are unclear at supraspecific levels as well, with some authorities uniting all three subgenera under Tamias (Levenson et aL, 1985; Nadler et al., 1977) , whereas others (Ellis and Maxson, 1979, 1980; Hafner, 1984) maintain the traditional use of Tamias and Eutamias (including Neotamias; White 1953a). Here we follow the latter course, recognizing that the entire assemblage is in need of revision; currently, any arrangement of subgenera is contradicted by at least some characters.",

Traditional cranial characters appear to be \"peculiarly susceptible to environmental influences\" (Merriam, 1885:28) , and thereby obscure underlying phyletic patterns (see also Allen, 1890:53; Pocock, 1923) . Chipmunk taxonomists employed a loosely defined complex of characters to delimit chipmunk species until Sutton (1953) and White (1953b) showed that otherwise poorly distinguished species could exhibit radically different bacula. Subsequent use of the baculum as a taxonomic tool has revolutionized chipmunk taxonomy: Hall and Kelson (1959) recognized only 16 species of Neotamias, while today 23 are recognized. Few other North American taxa, and none so conspicuous and diverse, can be so poorly known.",

Bacular differences and variability (e.g., Table 1 ) suggest that our sample sizes are probably adequate for diagnosis (Le., characterizations of mean differences), but are clearly inadequate for estimating or comparing populational variability. Distinction of ruficaudus and simulans would also be better substantiated if distinctive differences between the forms could be shown in other character sets. Nonetheless, bacular differences can be indicative of specific differentiation, even if the species are similar enough in other characters to qualify as \"cryptic\" or \"sibling\" species. As is true in other animal groups, \"Once discovered, and thoroughly studied, sibling species are usually found to have previously overlooked morphological differences\" (Mayr, 1969:183) . We anticipate that future research will identify additional differences between ruficaudus and simu[ans, perhaps including biochemical and ecological characters. Although Levenson et al. (1985) reported no fixed allelic differences between ruficaudus and simulans, their samples represented a single bacular morph (Le., typical ruficaudus).",

Univariate analyses of variance show the baculum to be an especially useful taxonomic character, showing highly significant differences between species but relatively minor variations within them. Comparisons of population means within species either lack significance or else describe relatively little character variation, while comparisons between species are highly significant and descriptive (Table 1) . Comparable analyses of cranial characters show a different pattern of variation, one of extensive variation both between and within groups. Five of the 22 within-taxon comparisons tabulated in Table 3 are significant. Because of such geographic and nongeographic character variation, it is more difficult to describe and diagnose chipmunk taxa using mensural cranial characters. This accounts for the limited reliance that taxonomists customarily place on cranial characters in keys to chipmunk taxa (e.g .. Hall, 1981: 340-342; Howell, 1929,30-33) .",

This was shown for Eutamias umbrinus and E. quadrivittatus by White (1953b;  see also Long and Cronkite, 1970) , for E. canipes and E. cinereicollis by Fleharty (960) , and for E. quadrivittatus and E. rufus by Patterson (1984) . It could be argued that, relative to cranial characters, the baculum is evolutionarily plastic, becoming \"fixed\" according to species in the absence of differentiation in other characters. However, Patterson (1980) showed Vol. 68, No.4 that chipmunks from the Organ Mountains of south-central New Mexico did not represent cinereicollis or canipes, as had been previously supposed, but instead represented a disjunct population of E. quadrivittatus. In this case, bacular morphology (corroborated by karyology) proved to be conservative compared to the external and cranial characters that caused this form to be confused with E. cinereicollis cinereU8 for 80 years. For this species complex and for other chipmunks (notably Howell's townsendii group; Callahan, 1977; Sutton and Nadler, 1974) , bacula appear to exhibit levels of within-group constancy and between-group variability that are useful for species diagnosis. For other chipmunks (e.g., members of the minimus group), in which the baculum is much smaller and possibly even vestigial, geographic variation of the baculum appears much more extensive and continuous (Sullivan, 1985) , and its value in diagnosing species limits may be correspondingly impaired.",

According to prevailing paradigms, Neotamias might be expected to produce hybrid zones, being specifically diverse and exhibiting numerous situations of congeners in parapatry. However, no study of contact among species of Neotamias has yet identified a hybrid zone. Although more detailed field studies will be needed to document the lack of hybrids in this and other areas of parapatry, we believe the pattern will only become more conspicuous under scrutiny.",
