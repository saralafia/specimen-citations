    "abstract": "NOTES ON MAMMALS FROM WESTERN AND SOUTHERN MEXICO The following notes on distribution and morphology of Mexican mammals are based on specimens contained in the University of Michigan Museum of Zoology. Most of the new records of occurrence are from. the coastal sierra of Michoacan, which is the southwestern segment of that state situated south of the Rio Tepalcaltepec and east of the rios Coahuayana and Tuxpan, From a zoogeographical standpoint the region is important, but not until recently have there been serious attempts to sample its fauna. Among late reports on some of its vertebrate species are papers by Peters (Occ, Papers Mus. Zoo!' Univ. Mich., 554, 1954) and Hooper (ibid., 565, 1955). The mammalian species listed below constitute new records for the region and, in addition, there are new data for other parts of Mexico. The specimens are from the following localities: Barolosa (Rancho), Michoacan: A ranch, in open pine forests, on the western slopes of the Cerro de Barolosa, about 11 hours by mule east of Coalcoman; probably near 18 0 50', 103 0 00'. Specimens were obtained at three stations on the Cerro, each designated by the collector (L. D. Beatty) as muleback time from Rancho Barolosa: (1) 20 min. SW, elevation 7,600 ft.; mature, open, pine forest bordering a natural meadow. (2) 30 min. SW, elevation 7,800 ft.; mature pine and oak forest. (3) 1 hr. 20 min. NE, elevation 8,900 ft., mature pine and oak forest, the floor with rotting logs and leaf litter. Carrizo (EI), Sinaloa: A ranch that includes a large earthen water \"tank\" bordered by tall cane-grass (carrizo) located 'h mi. east of the Nogales-Guadalajara Highway (No. 15) and~or :lh mi. south of the Sonora state line in Sinaloa; elevation approximately 50 ft.; mesquite-cactus plains. Coalcoman, Michoacam The principal town in the coastal sierra of Michoacan, situated at an elevation of approximately 3,500 ft. in the valley of the Rio de Coalcoman, cultivated fields, grassland, riparian forests, and hyacinth-choked ponds on the valley floor; dense brush, thorny trees, and oak on the lower hillsides, giving way to oak and pine at higher elevations.",

In coloration and in length of head and body (415 mm ), hind foot (96) and ear from notch on fresh skin (62), this specimen agrees with examples of S. f. restrictus from the vicinity of Cerro Tancitaro, Michoacan, but its skull is as large (basilar length, 61.9 mm ) as crania of S. cunicularius from that area of Michoacan.-EMMET T. HOOPER, Museum of Zoology, Univ. of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Received 15 December 1959. SMALL MAMMAL RECORDS FROM WESTERN UTAH Additional collecting, most of it subsequent to a previous report (Shippee and Egoscue, J. Mamm., 39: 275-277, 1958) has extended the known ranges of three mammals to include, Tooele County. New locality records for mammals already known or suspected to occur in western Utah also were obtained. Field work was supported in part by U.S. Army Chemical Corps contract DA-18-064-CML-2639, with the University of Utah. J. G. Bittmenn, Jay Linam and Stephen de St. Jeor assisted with the collecting. Specimens mentioned are in the collections of Ecological Research. Unless otherwise noted, all localities are in Tooele County. Measurements are in millimeters. Sorex vagrans vagrans Baird, vagrant shrew.-This small, rather brightly colored sub- species of the vagrant shrew previously has not been reported from desert valleys of the Bonneville Basin. Specimens from the north end of Skull Valley extend the known area of occurrence approximately 50 miles westward from several localities near Salt Lake City (Findley, Univ. Kans. Publ., Mus. Nat. Hist., 9: 57, 1955). The shrews were secured in tin-can traps baited with grain and set in runways of montane voles (see account of Microtus montanus nexus). Measurements of two females and one male are, respectively, as follows: Total length, 100, 100, 102; length of tail, 40, 39, 40; length of hind foot, 13, 12, 12; length of ear from notch, 5, 5, 5. Each female weighed 4.0 grams; the male weighed 3.5 grams. All were in the reddish-brown summer pelage. Although these speci-",
