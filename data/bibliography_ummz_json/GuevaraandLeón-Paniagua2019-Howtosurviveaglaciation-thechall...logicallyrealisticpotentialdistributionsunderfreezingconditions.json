Several species shifted ranges toward lower latitudes or elevations in response to extreme cold conditions (Davis and Shaw 2001) . These distributional shifts, coupled with subsequent warming, had consequences throughout the species' distributions, such as the fragmentation and isolation of populations, reduction of range size, local extinction and the need to persist in refugia for subsequent recolonizations. For this reason, considerable attention has focused on this major glaciation in order to better understand species' current distributional patterns (Peterson 2009) .",

Maxent (Phillips et al. 2006) has come to be one of the most commonly used algorithms (Booth et al. 2014) . It relies on the comparison of environments of sites where species occur with the range of environmental conditions presented across the study area (Elith et al. 2010) . The environmental variation available across the study area, typically referred to as the background, is crucial to characterize the response curves for each predictor variable (Merow et al. 2013) . A widely used strategy to generate this background is to sample conditions within the area that has been accessible to the species via dispersal over relevant time periods (Barve et al. 2011) , avoiding areas where species may be absent for reasons other than unsuitable climatic conditions (Anderson and Raza 2010) .",

If a geographic prediction is required for areas holding these non-analog conditions, the model should extrapolate the response curves. In the case of reconstructed distributions during the LGM, this issue is particularly relevant since the calibration of the model usually does not include extremely cold environments like those that existed during the ice age. If the niche model is transferred into the LGM when cold conditions were more common than in the present, then the prediction will depend on how the response curves are extrapolated into these non-analog conditions, which is hazardous and may not guarantee a biologically realistic prediction (Hirzel and Le Lay 2008 , Fitzpatrick and Hargrove 2009 , Nogu\u00e9s-Bravo 2009 , Guevara et al. 2018a ).",

Explicit comparisons to assess which extrapolation method is most appropriate to predict into non-analog LGM conditions have been largely overlooked (Guevara et al. 2018a) . Another way to deal with the problem of non-analog conditions is to capture a wider environmental range of species to calibrate models, characterizing the whole of the response curve and reducing the need to extrapolate (Thuiller et al. 2004 ). An example of how the range of environmental conditions can be increased is using a multi-temporal calibration approach, which can capture the different set of climatic conditions that a species has been exposed to over time (e.g. through the Quaternary; Nogu\u00e9s-Bravo 2009).",

The American pika occurs from close to sea level to about 4000 m, but its elevational distribution varies with latitude. Pikas are typically found in relatively cool and moist montane habitats (Hafner and Smith 2010) . The species has a widespread but discontinuous geographic distribution throughout mountainous areas of the western United States and southwestern Canadian provinces (Smith and Weston 1990) . In this region, high mountains and low intermountain basins were deeply influenced by cold-dry conditions corresponding to the LGM, with continental ice sheets engulfing areas in more northern latitudes (> 48\u00b0N in western Unites States, Ehlers et al. 2011) . Fossil data suggest that pika populations occupied lower elevations and latitudes during the LGM (Hafner 1993) , and genetic evidence indicates that the most northern populations are the result of postglacial expansions (Galbreath et al. 2009) . Consequently, an ecologically credible niche model for the American pika projected to conditions for the LGM should predict areas at high elevation and latitude to be unsuitable.",

We used filtered datasets at 10, 20, and 30 km to assess the potential effect of spatial bias and alternative scenarios of high to low sample sizes on the estimation of the niche (see Data accessibility). As potential niche predictors, we used six bioclimatic variables that reflect aspects of temperature and precipitation and represent surrogates for factors limiting the distribution of cold-adapted species: BIO 02 (mean diurnal range), BIO 03 (isothermality), BIO 05 (max temperature of warmest month), BIO 06 (min temperature of coldest month), BIO 13 (precipitation of wettest month), and BIO 14 (precipitation of driest month). We delimited the area to calibrate and project models by drawing a 2.5\u00b0 circular buffer around the localities before thinning. Given its extremely limited dispersal ability (Smith 1974) , we consider this area as a reasonable hypothesis of the accessible region via dispersal that minimize the inclusion of regions to which this species does not have access to (Barve et al. 2011 , Kubiak et al. 2017 .",

By doing this, we avoided artifactual truncation that can result from inadequate representation of the environmental background in a random sample (Guevara et al. 2018a) . To estimate the potential distributions during the LGM, we used the general circulation model from the Community Climate System Model (CCSM3; Collins et al. 2006) . We downloaded all current and LGM climate date at a spatial resolution of 2.5 min from the WorldClim dataset (Hijmans et al. 2005 ; <https://worldclim.org>). Importantly, we kept the same input data in our two experiments (see below) to reduce the contribution of confounding variables on the effect of restricted background datasets to calibrate models and transfer it into LGM conditions. In addition, it is not our objective to focus on the spatial variation that could be caused by the use of different general circulation models (Guevara et al. 2018b ).",

In Experiment 1 (hereafter, E1) we calibrated models in the context of only present-day climate conditions, which is the most common practice in Maxent. We then tested whether choosing an appropriate extrapolation method can improve geographic predictions onto LGM conditions by comparing two extrapolations methods available in Maxent (clamping versus unconstrained). In Experiment 2 (E2) we calibrated models using both present-day and LGM conditions associated with the background points, which is a variant of the multi-temporal calibration approach (Nogu\u00e9s-Bravo 2009) . For presence data, we also used the five fossil localities. Here we did not use pooled niches, but we calibrated single niche models using the environmental values of both the present and those that presumably existed during the LGM according to the CCSM scenario, which we call cross-time environmental background. Hence, each background point within the calibration area has two environmental values, one from current climate conditions and another from the climate during the LGM. In E2, we excluded background points from inaccessible areas that were covered by glaciers during the LGM (Supplementary material Appendix 1 Fig. A1 ). In E2 we also compared two extrapolation methods available in Maxent. In order to use the same background points in each experiment, we used the 'samples with data' (SWD) format (see tutorial in Maxent; Phillips 2017). As part of Maxent runs, we also obtained the multivariate environmental similarity surface (MESS) to indicate areas where non-analog conditions occur with respect to the conditions used in the calibration of the model and quantified the percentage of area with non-analogous conditions. MESS also provided information about which variable is driving this difference, which can be mapped as the most dissimilar variable (MoD) at any given pixel (Elith et al. 2010) .",

We applied a spatial block approach to data partitioning in order to yield model evaluation statistics, which is especially relevant in cross-time model transfer (Roberts et al. 2017) . Optimal settings were selected based on the model with the lowest AICc (Akaike information criterion corrected for small sample sizes; Warren and Seifert 2011), but we also inspected thresholddependent (omission rate for testing points, or OR10, using a threshold set by the 10% training omission rate) and threshold-independent (AUC for testing points, or AUCtest, and the difference between calibration and evaluation AUC, AUCdiff) evaluation statistics to validate performing in terms of overfitting and discrimination, respectively.

To facilitate the interpretation of niche overlap values we used the following classes (R\u00f6dder and Engler 2011) : no or very limited overlap (0-0.2), low overlap (0.2-0.4), moderate overlap (0.4-0.6), high overlap (0.6-0.8), and very high overlap (0.8-1.0).

It is worth mentioning the importance of understanding the degree of causality of different sets of predictor variables and how correlations between variables can change over time, an issue that was not addressed here.

However, here this did not guarantee biologically realistic predictions under glacial conditions. According to what we now know about the Pleistocene history in North America, the geographic predictions for Ochotona princeps were remarkably implausible when clamping was enforced as the extrapolation method (which is the default setting in Maxent). These results intuitively suggest that differences due to extrapolation methods will be more strongly accentuated by the amount of the study area which has non-analogous conditions (Guevara et al. 2018b) . The comparison between extrapolation methods is an issue that should draw attention, and more comparative analyses are needed in order to arrive at any generalities about which method is better.

Modifying the calibration area has an effect on the estimated response curves and variable importance in the models (VanDerWal et al. 2008 , Merow et al. 2013 . A widely used strategy is to sample the environmental background within the area that has been accessible for the species via dispersal over relevant time periods. For many species that are the subject of biogeographical studies, this relevant time period ranges from the LGM through the Pleistocene/Holocene transition, up to the present (Barve et al. 2011) . We agree with this strategy; however, given that niche models are built in environmental space, we consider that the background dataset should be chosen in the context of the environmental conditions in which species may occur, especially if the model is to be used to project past potential distributions. We then suggest that the background-pseudoabsence dataset should contain all the environments that have been presumably sampled by the species within the area that has accessible for the species via dispersal over relevant time periods, as a modification to the proposal by Barve et al. (2011) . Other climate snapshots besides the LGM should therefore be included in the model calibration to broaden the possibility of alternative climatic conditions across the evolutionary history of the species.",

First, background values sampled from LGM climates assume that more cold habitats were sampled by the species and were environmentally unsuitable, potentially causing a false negative signal (Anderson and Raza 2010) . Detailed information about the focal species' physiology could help validate these assumptions in order to enrich our conceptual model. Ochotona princeps, for example, is particularly vulnerable to acute cold stress, which is an important driver of local extinction or extirpation (Beever et al. 2010) . Then, even cold-adapted species may be physiologically stressed by cold temperatures, making it unlikely that they have survived in extremely cold conditions imposed by the LGM. Second, for species with a null or insufficient fossil record, it is certainly difficult to corroborate the presence of the species in an area over the Quaternary. Despite these potential drawbacks, model calibration in the context of both modern and past climates should be considered to reduce the effect of niche truncation and lead to more realistic predictions of distributional changes (Nogu\u00e9s-Bravo 2009 , Davis et al. 2014 ).

The grey zone represents non-analog conditions, where the prediction depends on the extrapolation method chosen by the Maxent user ((a) clamping; (b) unconstrained).

For example, insufficient sampling of cold environments across the calibration area of O. princeps altered and truncated the modeled response curves and seriously complicated geographical predictions towards more extreme cold conditions (Fig. 5 ). In these cases, exploratory data analyses should be performed before modeling to visualize if there are poorly-represented environments within the calibration area (Owens et al. 2013) .",

In this sense, we must pay careful attention to the model output corroboration within the modeling cycle (Augusiak et al. 2014) . Additional qualitative data or known patterns should be used whenever they are available to evaluate the model's credibility. Genetic and paleoecological evidence provide independent data against which to compare model outputs (Collevatti et al. 2013) . Knowledge about species' physiological limits are necessary to gain a more robust understanding of the fundamental niche of the species and therefore ensure the transferability of niche models across time and space. However, for most non-model organisms we need to approximate these physiological limits through correlative techniques, such as ecological niche modeling. We therefore need to improve existing tools and strategies or create new ones to generate more realistic models of species' responses to changing environments, leading to more useful biogeographic hypotheses.",
