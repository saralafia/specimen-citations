In the control tubes no. 5 and no. 6 no reaction was noted. The comparative intensities of the above reactions were determined by both maero-and microscopic examinations. It will be noted that a greater precipitin reaction occurs in the tube wherein the antigen is of a greater concentration than the antibody.",

Harvey, DOW 79 years old, remembered Bailey well and described him as a \"mere lad\" when BaiJey first detrained at Carter Station, nine miles north of Fort Bridger. At Bailey's query as to where he might find room and lodging in the vicinity, Harvey offered his house and the run of his ranch. Bailey accepted and used the house as headquarters and the ranch as his principal collecting ground on that and a second visit several years later to t.he Fort Bridger area.",
