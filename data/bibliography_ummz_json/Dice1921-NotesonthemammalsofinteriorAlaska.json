At the head of the North Fork of the Kuskokwim in March, 1912, marten tracks were abundant in the black spruce timber of the low hills, and a few were noted in the adjacent blueberry and dwarf birch patches. No tracks were noted in winter in the white spruce-paper birch forest along the rivers although one specimen was taken December 19, 1911, in a growth of young paper birch, white spruce, alder, and willows on a low hillside near Tanana. In summer, however, martens are reported by trappers to occur commonly in the white spruce-paper birch forests along the streams. The mating period at the head of the Kuskokwim is apparently in March. March 21, 1912 , tracks in the snow showed that a male had been pursuing a female the previous night. April 2 a female was taken containing four embryos, each about 5 inches in length; but another female taken April 16 contained no embryos. The skin of a male caught at the head of the North Fork of the Kuskokwim March 18, 1912, was perfectly prime; a female taken April 2 had several unprime spots on the skin; and the skin of a female taken April 16 in the same locality was very unprime.",

One inhabited the walls of a cabin in the hills north of Tanana during October and November, 1911. Owing to their small value trappers seldom make any special effort to trap ermine, though quite a number are taken in marten traps. October 5, 1911, a male was obtained by H. J. Christoffers near Fairbanks on which the head and tail were mostly brown, the back about half white, and the belly pure white. Four days' later a completely white male was obtained in the same region. At Tanana a fully white weasel was seen October 1. Weasels which were watched feeding on frozen pieces of rabbit and grouse did not handle nor hold the food in any way with the feet, but only with the mouth ..

Huge piles of the discarded scales mark the places where the squirrels live. October16, 1911, one was observed to bite off and eat the buds of black spruces. The nests are placed from six to twenty feet above the ground in large white or black spruce trees. Often several are found close together in the same tree or in adjacent trees. They are supported by some of the smaller branches and are usually though not always placed near or against the tree trunk.

September 6, 1911, near Tanana a red squirrel was watched while he was cutting cones from the top of a high white spruce. The cones were thrown away from the tree by a backward toss of his head and fell in all directions. He seemed to have no regular method of going over a branch for its cones, and I think several times returned to the same branch.
