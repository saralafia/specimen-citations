                "text": "unusual and interesting. Incidentally, if the damage done to farm crops last spring and this winter by the thousands of,deer in this locality is repeated every year, this animal will become a decided detriment to successful farming. In 1924, the Goss lemming mouse was for the first time found in considerable numbers at Lawrence, Kansas. During the past two years while working in the University of Kansas Museum of Natural History under the direction of C. D. Bunker, I took the opportunity to study, in the laboratory as well as in the field, the habits of this animal. The relative lack of published information concerning its habits prompted the preparation of this account which, unless otherwise indicated, is limited to original sources of information. That is, no attempt is here made to summarize the scanty literature on this subject. A. B. Howell's recent paper (Revision of the American Lemming Mice, N. A. Fauna, no. 50, June 30, 1927) gives a bibliography of the more important papers containing references to the genus Synaptomys. As a source of life-history information, the article by Quick and Butler (Amer. Nat., vol. 19, pp. 113-118, 1885) might well have been included with Howell's bibliography of Synaptomys. The first specimen of Synaptomys cooperi gossii (Coues) known to have been secured in Douglas County, Kansas, was that of a female, no. 1079, Univ. Kansas Mus. Nat. Hist., collected January 11, 1894, by E. D. Eames. Until found by the writer, this specimen had remained unrecognized among the specimens of Microtus ochrogaster. There is, unfortunately, no skull with the skin, but the short tail and characteristic pelage clearly distinguish it from Microtus. Although, as Linsdale points out (Notes on the Life History of Synaptomys, Journ. Mammalogy, vol. 8, pp. 51-54, 1927) , from this early date on, mice had been collected extensively in that vicinity, none was again taken until the winter of 1924-1925, when he collected a number of them. Linsdale (loc. cit.) reports specimens from Neosho Falls, Topeka, Leavenworth, Manhattan and Lawrence, Kansas. More recently they have also been taken in Atchison and Jackson counties, near Muscotah; Kansas, by R. A. Stirton, and near Garnett, Anderson County, Kansas, by T. E. White and the author. Most of the Synaptomys secured by the several collectors of the University of Kansas Museum have been taken in or near blue-grass associations where the grass had grown up from year to year and formed a thick mat that provided ideal feeding grounds as well as shelter. Seven miles southwest of Lawrence a number of Synaptomys were caught at the edge of a blue-grass patch near a creek where there was an undergrowth of grass of the genus Setaria among some dry weeds. Others were caught in a patch of blue grass on a north-facing slope near the top of a high hill one and one-half miles west of Lawrence. In wet weather this patch of grassland is decidedly",

However, in eastern Kansas at least, it is usually necessary to examine a runway for only a short distance to determine the form occupying it.
