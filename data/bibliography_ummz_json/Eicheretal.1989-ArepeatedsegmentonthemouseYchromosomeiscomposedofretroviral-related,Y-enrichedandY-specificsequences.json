    "abstract": "We report the isolation and characterization of two recombinant clones containing DNA derived from the Y chromosome of the C57BL/10 inbred mouse strain. Both clones were isolated from a lambda phage library derived from a partial EcoRI digest of C57BL/10 male DNA using the murine retrovirus M720. Characterization of these clones showed they were derived from a repeated segment present on the C57BL/10J Y chromosome that contains sequences related to a previously unknown group of murine retroviruses, as well as repetitive sequences found elsewhere in the genome. In addition, one clone contained a sequence, designated YB10, that is unique to the Y chromosome and present in approximately ,500 copies on the C57BL/1 OJ Y chromosome. Analysis of SOUTHERN blots containing DNAs prepared from females and males of representative species from four subgenera of Mus probed with pYBlO and the J'LTR from one of the Y-associated retroviruses (MuRVY) revealed that, with the exception of a single fragment observed in both female and male DNA of Mus saxicola, hybridization to pYBlO was observed only to male DNA of the species Mus spretus, Mus hortulanus, Mus musculus, Mus domesticus and Mus abbotti. In addition, the pattern and intensity of hybridization to YBlO and the MuRVY-LTR indicated that sequence of divergence was followed by amplification of Y chromosome sequences containing YBlO and MuRVY. The divergence and amplification occurred separately in each of the ancestral lineages leading to M. spretus, M. hortulanus, M. abbotti, M. musculus and M. domesticus. We suggest that acquisition and amplification of DNA sequences by the mammalian Y chromosome has contributed to its evolution and may imply that the mammalian Y chromosome is evolving at a faster rate than the rest of the genome.

It does, however, contain loci necessary for the survival of each species-those involved in testis determination and possibly sperm formation. In 1914 H. J. MULLER hypothesized that the X and Y chromosomes of Drosophila originated from a pair of homologous autosomes. If, as suggested by OHNO (1967), the mammalian X and Y chromosomes also evolved from homologous chromosomes, extensive DNA sequence variation as well as rearrangements and deletions have occurred repeatedly in the evolution of the Y chromosome. In fact, if synapsis is indicative of sequence homology, the only area of extensive homology still shared by the mammalian X and Y chromosomes is within their pairing region. Recent data support this conclusion (reviewed by GOODFEL-LOW, DARLING and WOLFE 1985) .",

To identify Y chromosome-derived DNA sequences, we hybridized retroviral-derived probes to SOUTHERN blots containing restriction enzyme digested DNA from females and males of inbred mouse strains. T w o types of retroviral-related sequences were identified in male DNA: a 5.5-kb EcoRI fragment that hybridized to an amphotropic retroviral LTR (long terminal repeat) and four EcoRI fragments that hybridized to a xenotropic-type C virus called M720 (PHILLIPS et al. 1982) . The male-specific M720related sequences are of special interest because they are present on the Y chromosome in at least 100 copies, unlike the single copy male-specific LTR fragment. The multiple copy nature and unique size of these male-specific fragments provided us with the opportunity to efficiently isolate Y chromosome-derived \"720-related clones from a C57BL/10 male library.",

                "text": "Although these results support the hypothesis that the XY6 and XY45 clones are of Ychromosomal origin, either or both of these cloned sequences could reside elsewhere in the genome because the assay using nick translated genomic DNA reflects the concentration of repeats in the probe (genome) rather than the exact DNA sequence being tested (SHEN and MANIATIS 1980). For example, an individual copy of an M720related sequence, regardless of chromosomal origin, would yield a stronger hybridization signal when probed with total male DNA vs. female DNA because there are more copies of M72O-related sequences in the male genome. In addition, the presence of one or more ubiquitous sequences, such as B1, B2, or Line elements, within any fragments would obscure differences between female and male DNA. Thus, for example, although there appears to be a similar number of 3.0-kb EcoRI fragments present in the female and male genomes, there may be more copies in the male genome if this fragment contains a ubiquitous repeated sequence. T o determine whether these clones were of Y chromosomal origin, EcoRI restriction fragments were isolated from XY6 and XY45 and subcloned into pBR325. Each subclone was then used to probe SOUTHERN blots of EcoRI digested C57BL/10J male and female DNA. As seen in Figure 4 , both EcoRI fragments from XY6 hybridize to fragments present in both sexes as well as fragments specific to or found in greater copy number in male DNA, again consistent with the potential Y chromosomal origin of XY6. The definitive proof of the Y chromosomal origin of XY6 was obtained when an EcoRIIPstI fragment derived from XY6 ( Figure 2 ) was used as a hybridization probe to genomic male and female DNAs. This fragment, designated YBlO, hybridized only to male DNA even after long exposure times ( Figure 5 ). From these results we conclude that XY6 is of Y chromosomal origin because it contains a sequence present exclusively in male DNA.",

As seen in Table 1 and as mentioned above, the 7.4-kb EcoRI fragment of XY6 shares sequence homology with the 4.3-kb EcoRI fragment of XY6 and XY45 based on the presence of M72O-related (MuRVY) sequences in both. In addition, the 4.3-kb EcoRI fragments derived from both XY6 and XY45 share homology with the 8.0-kb EcoRI fragment of XY45. This homology is not due to M720related or MuRVY sequences because neither M720 nor the 7.4-kb EcoRI fragment hybridizes to the 8.0kb EcoRI fragment. The reason for this cross hybridization is unknown at this time. After long exposure hybridization of the 0.2-kb EcoRI fragment from XY45 was detected with the 8.0-kb EcoRI fragment from XY45, indicating these fragments share a limited sequence homology. Finally, the 3.0-kb EcoRI and 2.0-kb EcoRI fragments from XY45 did not hybridize with any other EcoRI fragments generated from XY6 or XY45. Because both the 3.0-kb EcoRI and 2.0-kb EcoRI fragments hybridize with nick translated female DNA, we conclude that each contains repetitive sequences located elsewhere in the genome.",

In experiment 1 (data not shown), the intensity of hybridization of the most abundant size class of EcoRI fragments (7.4 kb) observed in male DNA was equivalent to that observed in female DNA containing between 100 and 500 copies of XY6, and estimated by densitometry to be 450 copies. In experiment 2 (shown in Figure 6 ), the number of copies of the 7.4-kb EcoRI fragment present in the male genome was equivalent to that observed in female DNA containing between 500 and 600 copies of XY6, and determined to be 550 copies by densitometry. Assuming that all (500 copies, the average of experiments 1 and 2) of the 7.4-kb EcoRI YB10-related fragments are present in the repeated sequence identified by XY6, a minimum estimate of the amount of the C57BL/10J Y chromosome occupied by this repeated sequence can be calculated.

The patterns of hybridization observed when any of the EcoRI fragments isolated from XY6 or XY45 are used to probe SOUTHERN blots containing male and female DNA suggest that each recognizes DNA sequences that are Y-specific or Yenriched and present in multiple copies on the Y chromosome. Thus, XY6 and XY45 are either of Y chromosomal origin or derived from a region of the genome that contains sequences present in multiple copies on the Y chromosome. Proof for the Y chromosomal origin of XY6 was obtained using an EcoRI/ PstI fragment (YB10) derived from the 7.4-kb EcoRI fragment as a probe to SOUTHERN blots containing EcoRI-digested female and male mouse DNA. Hybridization was observed only to male DNA. Further support for the Y chromosomal origin of XY45 was obtained by comparing its 4.3-kb EcoRI fragment with the 4.3-kb EcoRI fragment isolated from XY6.

In addition, we observed a species-specific pattern of hybridization for these five species. These data suggest that the YBlO sequence arose on the Mus Y chromosome after this group diverged from other species in the subgenus Mus that lack YB 10 sequences, including M. caroli, M. cervicolor and M . cookii. We suggest that the origin of the novel YBlO sequence of DNA on the Y chromosome occurred by integration of a foreign DNA sequence into the Y chromosome of the ancestor common to M. spretus, M. abbotti, M . hortulanus, M. musculus and M. domesticus and that the YB 10 species-specific patterns of hybridization observed for these five species is due to sequence divergence and amplification of YBlO during subsequent speciation events.",

We found that most of the YB 1 0-positive EcoRI fragments present in M. spretus, M. abbotti, M. hortulanus, M. musculus and M. domesticus contain MuRVY sequences, suggesting that the appearance of MuRVY and YBlO in the Y chromosome in this subgroup of mice occurred in a common ancestor. In addition, subsequent divergence and amplification of a DNA segment containing YBI 0 and MuRVY sequences occurred independently in the lineages leading to these five species. Because the Y chromosomes of M . musculus and M . domesticus contain multiple copies of a 7.4-kb EcoRI fragment containing YBlO and MuRVY sequences and this fragment is absent in M. spretus and M . hortulanus and present in lower copy number in M. abbotti, further amplification of this segment of Y chromosomal DNA must have occurred in the male ancestor common to M. musculus and M. domesticus.

                "text": "Our data, combined with other data on the mouse and human Y chromosome (see reviews on molecular organization of the human Y chromosome by BISHOP et a1 1985; DAIGER and CHAKRABORTY 1985; GOOD-FELLOW, DARLING and WOLFE 1985; LAU 1985; WIL-LARD 1985) , suggest that sequence acquisition and amplification play a role in evolutionary divergence of mammalian Y chromosomes. For example, over 50% of the DNA sequences of the human Y chromosome are composed of two families of simple repeats, the HaeIII 3.4-kb (DYZ1) and HaeIII 2.1-kb (DYZ2) families (COOKE 1976) . Interestingly, neither of these repeated sequences are found on the Y chromosome of the chimpanzee or gorilla, the closest relatives of human beings, although DYZl and DYZ2 related sequences are present on autosomes in both species (COOKE, SCHMIDTKE and GOSDEN 1982; KUNKE.L and SMITH 1982) . These data imply that the DYZl and DYZ2 sequences on the human Y chromosome are derived from an integration of an autosomal sequence into the Y chromosome with subsequent amplification. As shown in this report, the Y chromosomes of five species of mice from the subgenera Mus have multiple copies of a sequence containing YBlO and MuRVY while at least three other species in this subgenera lack YBlO sequences entirely. Our data indicate that amplification of YBlO sequences together with adjacent sequences containing the retrovirus MuRVY occurred independently in the lineages leading to M. spretus, M . abbotti and M. hortulanus, as well as the lineages leading to M . musculus and M. domesticus. In the latter two species, further amplification of these sequences occurred such that their Y chromosomes contain approximately 500 copies of this repeated sequence. For example, estimates of the copy number of the XY6 7.4-kb EcoRI fragment present in C57BL/ lOJ male genomic DNA indicate that it is present in 500 copies and accounts for approximately 5.5% of the DNA constituting the Y chromosome. Certainly, such integration and amplification of DNA sequences on the Y chromosomes of man and mouse argues that this is a common method for rapid evolution of the mammalian Y chromosome.",

Thus, as a whole the mammalian Y chromosome may be evolving at a faster rate than are the other mammalian chromosomes. If we are correct, then low copy number Y-specific sequences that hybridize to Y chromosomal DNA from distantly related mammalian species are perhaps the only sequences that the Y chromosome requires to ensure its retention by the mammalian genome. Some of these sequences will include centromere-and telemere-related sequences which are necessary for successful transmission during cell division, pairing and recombination sequences which are necessary to guarantee segregation from the X chromosome during male meiosis, and sequences involved in primary sex determination.",
