    "abstract": "This report is the first installment of a monographic study of mammalian diversity and ethnomammalogy in a sparsely inhabited rainforest region between the Yavar\u00ed and Ucayali rivers in northeastern Peru. Our study is based on several large collections of mammals (totaling about 3500 specimens) made at various localities in this region between 1926 and 2003, and on our long-term ethnobiological and linguistic fieldwork with the Matses, a Panoan-speaking group of indigenous Amazonians who still obtain most of their dietary protein by hunting mammals. Our primary objectives are to document the species richness of the regional fauna through taxonomic analysis of collected specimens, and to assess the detail and accuracy of Matses knowledge of mammalian natural history by linguistic analysis of recorded interviews. The regional primate fauna is definitely known to consist of at least 14 species documented by collected specimens and/or repeated sightings of taxa with visually conspicuous diagnostic traits. This fauna includes three atelids (Alouatta seniculus, Ateles belzebuth, Lagothrix lagothricha), eight cebids (Aotus nancymaae, Callimico goeldii, Callithrix pygmaea, Cebus albifrons, Cebus apella, Saguinus fuscicollis, Saguinus mystax, Saimiri sciureus), and three pitheciids (Cacajao calvus, Callicebus cupreus, Pithecia monachus). All 14 species are known to occur sympatrically at one inventory site, but Goeldi's monkey (Callimico goeldii) is rare and uakaris (Cacajao calvus) seem to be patchily distributed, so some local faunas may have only 12 or even fewer species. This regional fauna is unique because neighboring interfluvial regions lack some species that are present in the Yavar\u00ed-Ucayali interfluve, and because some species that are present in neighboring interfluvial regions are not known to occur between the Yavar\u00ed and the Ucayali. Matses knowledge about primate natural history is clearly correlated with size and cultural importance. For example, information obtained from standardized interviews about spider monkeys (Ateles belzebuth, a large game species) can be parsed into 86 observations about its ecology and/or behavior, whereas interviews about pygmy marmosets (Callithrix pygmaea, a small nongame species) contain only nine observations on these topics. Item-by-item comparisons of Matses observations about spider monkeys with the published results of scientific field research suggests that the Matses are generally accurate observers of primate natural history, a conclusion that is additionally supported by comparing community patterns of resource use compiled from our interview data with community-ecological studies of primate faunas in the scientific literature. Most exceptions (discrepancies between Matses observations and the scientific literature) can be explained by cultural inattention to small nongame species. Although these results suggest that archiving native Amazonian knowledge about mammalian natural history might be a cost-effective alternative to lengthy fieldwork for some research objectives, there are significant linguistic barriers than can inhibit effective cross-cultural communication. Among the Matses, these include a surprisingly large number of zoologically redundant names (synonyms and hyponyms). Relevant primate examples are discussed in substantive detail. 10 BULLETIN AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY NO. 351",

To an observer rising in a small plane from one of the few dirt airstrips scratched in the green hide of forest that still stretches from horizon to horizon, the landscape seems static and monotonous, but the geological reality is not. Writhing like enormous snakes within the broad confines of their meander belts, great white-water rivers with catchment basins larger than many European countries annu-ally deposit and rework millions of tons of nutrient-rich sediments weathered from the Andes, building new land on alternate banks while eroding old land from the opposite shores. Oxbow lakes and palm swamps mark the location of extinct river channels in the same floodplain landscapes, whose complexity and dynamic nature are now apparent from satellite imagery. Between the river floodplains, however, and comprising by far the most extensive habitat in southwestern Amazonia, are vast hilly wedges of unbroken upland forest. Dissected by small streams too narrow even for canoe travel, the roadless interiors of many of these interfluvial regions remain largely inaccessible and biologically unexplored.",

Separated by open seaways from other landmasses throughout much of the Tertiary, South America was an island continent where a few founding clades (marsupials, xenarthrans, archaic ''ungulates'') and early overwater colonists (primates, caviomorph rodents) radiated in isolation from neighboring faunas in North America and Antarctica. Then, beginning in the late Miocene, but accelerating dramatically after the Panamanian landbridge emerged in the Pliocene, a flood of immigrant taxa-proboscideans, carnivores, deer, peccaries, tapirs, lagomorphs, and cricetid rodents-mingled with the old endemic elements and, briefly, resulted in what was perhaps the most diverse continental fauna that has ever existed. Although mammalian diversity in South America was subsequently winnowed by Pleistocene extinctions, the causes of which are still controversial (Vrba, 1993; Lessa and Fari\u00f1 a, 1996; Webb and Rancey, 1996; Lessa et al., 1997) , Amazonian lowland rainforests still support globally maximal numbers of sympatric mammalian species (Voss and Emmons, 1996) .",

Professional collectors in the early 20th century contributed much additional material for museum taxonomists to work with, but reliable information about the natural history of Amazonian mammals was not forthcoming until the advent of longterm field studies in the last few decades (e.g., Terborgh, 1983; Dubost, 1988; Emmons, 1988; Bodmer, 1990) .

For brevity, we will refer to this region as the Yavar\u00ed-Ucayali interfluve to distinguish it from neighboring regions delimited by other Amazonian tributaries. 1 Most of this region consists of densely forested hills, usually less than 200 m above sea level, that are drained by small clear-water, black-water, or mixedwater (dark but turbid) streams. The Ucayali and the Amazon, however, are huge, sediment-laden, white-water rivers with broad floodplains characterized by ridge-and-swale topography (Lamotte, 1990; Puhakka et al., 1992) , and the Tapiche drains an extensive low-lying flood basin in the western part of the region (Kalliola et al., 1993) . Local soils-weathered from Miocene lacustrine deposits of the Pebas Formation (Hoorn, 1993; Wesselingh et al., 2002) and from more recently deposited fluvial sediments-include a wide variety of variously colored clays, sandy clay loams, and sandy loams, but there are also extensive areas of white quartz sand along the upper R\u00edo Blanco (a right-bank tributary of the Tapiche) and in the adjacent headwater region of the R\u00edo G\u00e1 lvez (a leftbank tributary of the Yavar\u00ed; Stallard, 2006) . Rocks crop out in the remote headwaters of the R\u00edo Tapiche and the R\u00edo Yaqueranawhich both arise in the Sierra del Divisor (Vriesendorp et al., 2006b )-but stones are unknown (except as exotic curiosities) elsewhere in the region, where streams have sandy or muddy bottoms.",

Although the natural vegetation throughout the region can be broadly described as lowland rain forest, strikingly different forest types occur side by side at most sites that have been studied to date. Thus, L\u00f3 pez-Parodi and Freitas (1990) recognized nine types of forest in the vicinity of Jenaro Herrera, including two seral stages related to riverine succession, several distinct tree communities associated with seasonally or permanently flooded sites, and four kinds of forest growing on well-drained uplands. Other published surveys of local vegetation in the region, whether based on indigenous forest classification systems (e.g., Fleck and Harder, 2000) or rapid assessments by teams of botanical researchers (Pitman et al., 2003; Fine et al., 2006) , have likewise stressed the importance of succession, flooding regimes, topography, and soils as local determinants of rainforest physiognomy and floristics. Diagrammatic vegetation profiles that illustrate the general character and site-to-site variability of forest vegetation in the region are in Bodmer (1990: fig. 2 ) and Fleck and Harder (2000: figs. 3, 4) ; color photographs of local vegetation are in Pitman et al.

According to Pitman et al. (2003) , the first 50 trees surveyed at an upland primary-forest site with relatively poor soil (about 20 km downriver from Colonia Angamos on the left bank of the Yavar\u00ed) represented 45 species, and upland sites with richer soils farther downriver appear to support even more speciose tree communities. Apparently, these tall, diverse, climax forests-which probably cover some 80%-90% of the local terrain-are floristically similar to those found elsewhere in northeastern Peru (e.g., near Iquitos; V\u00e1 squez-Mart\u00ednez and Phillips, 2000) . Numerically abundant and/or exceptionally speciose families of trees at one or more of the upland primary-forest sites visited by Pitman et al. (2003) and Fine et al. (2006) include (in alphabetical order) Annonaceae, Burseraceae, Euphorbiaceae, Lecythidaceae, Leguminosae, Moraceae, Myristicaceae, Palmae, Rubiaceae, Sapindaceae, and Sapotaceae. Striking floristic variation, however, was observed among upland sites differing in soil fertility, with the result that unique sets of families dominated the tree flora at each surveyed locality. Most well-drained sites (except those on white sand and on sandy hill crests) have a dense understory vegetation with abundant giant herbs (e.g., Heliconiaceae, Marantaceae), dwarf palms, shrubs, and seedling trees; a structurally complex subcanopy; a more or less closed canopy layer at 25-35 m; and scattered emergents that may be 40 m or more in height.",

These habitats are much less botanically diverse than forests growing on adjacent upland sites; in one plot of swamp forest surveyed by Pitman et al. (2003) , over half the trees belonged to just three families (Palmae, Clusiaceae, and Lepidobotryaceae). The most visually conspicuous elements of the swamp-forest flora are large palms, of which Mauritia flexuosa and Euterpe precatoria, are usually the most abundant (and faunally important) species.

These canebrakes are subsequently invaded by several species of trees, with distinct seral stages dominated in turn by Cecropia membranacea (Cecropiaceae) and Ficus insipida (Moraceae). Smaller, more slowly meandering rivers in the region (e.g., the Tapiche and the Yavar\u00ed) have a different successional sequence that usually begins with a narrow zone of shrubby vegetation (pioneered by Alchornia castanaefolia [Euphorbiaceae]) rather than canebrakes; successive seral stages include somewhat more diverse tree communities than occur behind the beach vegetation of larger rivers (Puhakka et al., 1993; Pitman et al., 2003) . Mature floodplain forest (''riverine forest'' sensu L\u00f3 pez-Parodi and Freitas, 1990 ) is very tall, floristically diverse, and contains many large and valuable timber species (e.g., Cedrela odorata and Swietenia macrophylla [Meliaceae] ).",

White-sand forests have a unique flora that is depauperate in species by comparison with upland forests on adjacent hillsides with richer soils; they are composed of shorter, thinner trees that form a broken, uneven canopy; and they are supported by a thick rootmat that largely conceals the underlying mineral substrate. Although largely unstudied and doubtless exhibiting regional peculiarities, the whitesand forests of the Yavar\u00ed-Ucayali interfluve probably resemble those found elsewhere in Peru (e.g., near Iquitos; Ruokolainen and Tuomisto, 1993) and Brazil (Anderson, 1981) in most essential floristic and structural characteristics.",

The scant recorded history of the Yavar\u00ed basin, punctuated at intervals by bloody encounters with its indigenous inhabitants, was reviewed by Bodmer and Puertas (2003) , who noted that the nontribal population of this region has been in decline for many decades. Despite its proximity to Iquitos (a city large enough to boast an international airport), the Yavar\u00ed-Ucayali interfluve remains sparsely populated. Small communities of nontribal Amazonians (variously known as mestizos or ribere\u00f1 os) are scattered along the right banks of the Ucayali and the Amazon, and a few military outposts are sited at strategic points on the left bank of the Yavar\u00ed. Although several tribes (including the Kokama and the Yagua) once occupied the floodplains of the Ucayali and the Amazon, and others (including the May\u00fa /Morike, the Remo, and the Kapanawa) lived along the upper R\u00edo Tapiche, most of these groups are now either extinct or in an advanced state of culture and language loss. Today, the Matses and the Tikuna are the only culturally intact indigenous peoples that still inhabit the Yavar\u00ed-Ucayali interfluve. Whereas Tikuna territory is now restricted to a small wedge of land between the lower Yavar\u00ed and the Amazon, Matses communities are more extensively distributed in the forested interior, mostly along the R\u00edo G\u00e1 lvez and the Quebrada Chobayacu.",

The Matses currently number about 2500 people living along the R\u00edo Yavar\u00ed and its tributaries in Peru and Brazil. Prior to 1969, the Peruvian Matses avoided contact by maintaining hostile relations with nontribal Peruvian and Brazilian communities, and by living in upland forests far from navigable rivers. Peaceful contact was initiated in 1969 by personnel of the Summer Institute of Linguistics (Vivar, 1975) , and assimilation of the Peruvian Matses into the national culture is now proceeding rapidly. Because of their recent isolation, however, older individuals (.35 years of age) still possess undiminished traditional knowledge. Many aspects of traditional Matses culture, including their subsistence technology, are described and illustrated by Romanoff et al. (2004) . Currently, most of the Matses continue to meet all their nutritional needs through traditional subsistence activities including hunting, fishing, trapping, swidden (''slashand-burn'') agriculture, and collection of wild fruits. Of particular relevance for this study, the Matses still obtain the majority of their dietary protein by hunting. Their most important game species are all large mammals, although caimans (Caiman crocodilus, Paleosuchus spp.), tortoises (Geochelone spp.), river turtles (Podocnemis spp.), birds (guans, curassows, trumpeters, tinamous, etc) , and certain species of frogs are also eaten occasionally; unlike most other native Amazonians, the Matses do not eat insects or other invertebrates (Romanoff, 1976 (Romanoff, , 1983 (Romanoff, , 1984 Fleck, 1997; Fleck et al., 1999; Fleck and Harder, 2000) .",

Kalinowski left no narrative account of his collecting activities, but a rough itinerary can be reconstructed from his field catalog of specimens (in the FMNH Division of Mammals archives). Kalinowski's first collecting station in the Yavar\u00ed-Ucayali interfluve was at Santa Cecilia, on the right (east) bank of the R\u00edo Manit\u00ed, where he collected 106 mammals between 27 December 1956 and 21 January 1957. After an interval spent at various localities on the left (north) bank of the Amazon from February to April, and another period during which no mammals were collected in May and June, Kalinowski worked briefly at San Fernando on the left (north) bank of the lower Yavar\u00ed, where he collected 16 specimens from the 10th through the 15th of July. From here, Kalinowski moved upstream to the mouth of the Yaquerana (i.e., the confluence of the upper Yavar\u00ed and the G\u00e1 lvez), where he collected from the 3rd through the 30th of August; 57 specimens are labeled as having been collected at this remote site (''Boca R\u00edo Yaquerana''), which was only a few kilometers upstream from the present-day military outpost of Angamos. After descending the Yavar\u00ed, Kalinowski next camped at Quebrada Esperanza on the lower Yavar\u00ed-Mir\u00edm, where he obtained 126 specimens in about three weeks (6-27 September). Seven specimens taken at San Vicente on the lower Yavar\u00ed on 2 October were the last that this indefatigable collector obtained in the Yavar\u00ed-Ucayali interfluve.",

Substantial collections from this locality were made over several decades by mammalogists from the Museo de Historia Natural de la Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos (MUSM). Most of these collections-totaling 428 specimens of bats, marsupials, and rodents in the MUSM and AMNH-were made by Cesar Ascorra (from 30 November 1988 through 10 September 1991), Victor Pacheco (26 April-5 May 1990) , Jessica Amanzo (6 March-6 April 1997 , 8 June-24 July 2003 , and Lynne Villalobos (9 June-24 July 2003). The holotype of Amphinectomys savamis and about 750 other specimens of small mammals collected by a Soviet research team that worked at Jenaro Herrera from 1985 to 1991 are preserved in the Zoological Museum of the M.V. Lomonosov University in Moscow (Pavlinov, 1994) .",

Primatologists first worked here in 1975 (Castro and Soini, 1977) , and the Estaci\u00f3 n Biol\u00f3 gica Quebrada Blanco-established soon thereafter-has served as the base camp for numerous subsequent studies of the local primate fauna (e.g., Heymann, 1989 Heymann, , 1990 Garber, 1993; Heymann and Aquino, 1994; Aquino, 1998; Nickle and Heymann, 1996; Nadjafzadeh and Heymann, 2008) . Local ungulate populations have also been studied here (e.g., by Bodmer et al., 1988; Bodmer, 1990) . Faunal studies based on the lower Quebrada Blanco often included ob-servations made in the adjoining Reserva Comunal Tamshiyacu-Tahuayo, a protected area that extends from the headwaters of the Tamshiyacu and Tahuayo rivers across the hilly divide that separates the Amazon and Yavar\u00ed watersheds to the upper Yavar\u00ed-Mir\u00edm (Puertas and Bodmer, 1993; Hurtado-Gonzales and Bodmer, 2004) . 2 Faunal inventory work by Michael Valqui, formerly a graduate student based at the Florida Museum of Natural History (FLMNH), resulted in the first substantial collections of usable specimens from Tahuayo-Blanco watershed (Valqui, 1999 (Valqui, , 2001 . Valqui's study was centered at the village of San Pedro (about 4 km north of the Estaci\u00f3n Biol\u00f3 gica Quebrada Blanco), but he also collected specimens as far as 25 km upstream from San Pedro on the Quebrada Blanco (within the Reserva Comunal Tamshiyacu-Tahuayo), and at a settlement known as El Chino (about 5 km NW San Pedro) on the lower R\u00edo Tahuayo (see map inset; fig. 2 ). Valqui's collections from these localities, which were obtained between 14 May 1994 and 12 June 1998, include 609 specimens of marsupials and rodents at the FLMNH and MUSM.",

All monologs were recorded in the Matses language. To elicit these texts, informants were asked to talk about a single mammalian taxon (e.g., a species of monkey, or bats in general), which was mentioned only once by the interviewer (Fleck) . Informants were asked to say as much as they liked about any topic relating to the taxon in question, and were not interrupted or asked to continue, regardless of the length of their monolog (see appendix 1 for a transcription and translation of one of these recorded monologs; the appendix also contains an explanation of the Matses orthography used in the accounts). Each informant's monologs were recorded with no other adults present in order to achieve independence of response. For each taxon, the interview was replicated a total of 7 or 8 times with different informants. These recordings were subsequently transcribed and translated by Fleck and literate Matses assistants, and checked for linguistic accuracy with several other Matses speakers. The texts were then checked with speakers other than the narrators to obtain second opinions on the validity of some of the less commonly asserted natural history details.",

Palms were collected by Fleck in 1998 and 1999 from the area surrounding Nuevo San Juan with the help of Matses assistants, who named the palms while in the forest, prior to collection. Palm specimens were identified in the field using published identification guides (Henderson, 1994; Henderson et al., 1995) , and voucher material was subsequently deposited at the herbarium at the Museo de Historia Natural de la Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos (Lima) and in the New York Botanical Garden (New York). Other plants, particularly dicotyledonous trees, were identified by Fleck and two Matses assistants at the arboretum of the Instituto de Investigaciones de la Amazon\u00eda Peruana. This arboretum is maintained at the Centro de Investigaciones Jenaro Herrera, a forestry research station located about 80 km north-west of Nuevo San Juan, where Swiss botanists have identified all trees .10 cm at breast height (Spichiger et al., 1989 (Spichiger et al., , 1990 . Plants and trees in the proximity of Nuevo San Juan were also identified by Fleck using identification keys in Gentry (1993) . Botanical taxa corresponding to Matses plant names are provided in square brackets (under the heading ''Matses Natural History'' for each primate species account) using the following conventions: (1) The generic name alone is provided when the Matses plant name corresponds to all the species in a locally polytypic genus (e.g., bin [Castilla (Moraceae)]). (2) The generic name is followed by ''sp.'' if the Matses plant name corresponds to just one unidentified local species in a genus (e.g., ichibin [Matisia sp. and Eriotheca sp. (Bombacaceae)]). (3) The generic name is followed by ''spp.'' if the Matses plant name corresponds to two or more unidentified species, but not to all the local species of that genus (e.g., \u015fhankuin [Pourouma spp. (Moraceae)]). Where alternative technical names for plant families are current in the literature (e.g., Palmae vs. Arecaceae, Clusiaceae vs. Guttiferae), the nomenclature used here follows Gentry (1993) .",

IDENTIFICATION: Morphological revisions of howler monkeys have recognized as few as six valid species (Hill, 1962) , but as many as 14 might be recognized on the basis of coatcolor phenotypes (Groves, 2001; Gregorin, 2006) . Cytogenetic and molecular research provides compelling support for some, but not all, of the species recognized in the recent taxonomic literature and underscores our still incomplete understanding of this geographically widespread genus. In the absence of any published synthesis of phenotypic and genetic data, the following remarks summarize the emerging taxonomic consensus, suggest where future research could usefully be focused, and explain our preferred binomen for the red howlers of the Yavar\u00ed-Ucayali interfluve. Phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial DNA sequence data (Cort\u00e9s-Ortiz et al., 2003) support the recognition of just two trans-Andean howler species: Alouatta palliata (Gray, 1849), the mantled howler of Mesoamerica and northwestern South America, and A. pigra Lawrence, 1933 , the black howler of Guatemala and southeastern Mexico. 4 The distinctness of these species, which was first clearly indicated by conspicuous cranial and pelage differences that are maintained in sympatry (Smith, 1970) , is additionally supported by karyotypic data (Steinberg et al., 2008) and by patterns of allelic variation at eight microsatellite loci (Ellsworth and Hoelzer, 2006) . By contrast, the nominal taxon coibensis Thomas, 1902 (from the Azuero Peninsula and Coiba Island, Panama), which was recognized as a valid species by Groves (2001 Groves ( , 2005 , seems to be genetically indistinguishable from A. palliata (see Cort\u00e9s-Ortiz et al., 2003) .",

Although subtle differences in pelage color, sexual dichromatism, and hyoid morphology are said to exist among some of these forms (Gregorin, 2006) , chromosomal comparisons provide the most compelling evidence for species recognition. Unfortunately, published karyotypes have only been reported for arctoidea (see Stanyon et al., 1995) , macconnelli (including ''straminea''; Lima et al., 1990; Lima and Seu\u00e1 nez, 1991; Vassart et al., 1996) , sara (see Minezawa et al., 1985; Stanyon et al., 1995) , and seniculus (see Yunis et al., 1976; Lima and Seu\u00e1 nez, 1991) . Among other chromosomal differences described in this literature, a shared Y-auto-some translocation in arctoidea, macconnelli, and sara has resulted in a X 1 X 2 Y 1 Y 2 /X 1 X 1 X 2 X 2 sex-chromosome system, whereas seniculus has the standard XY/XX system. Chromosome painting (Consigliere et al., 1996; Oliveira et al., 2002) , mtDNA sequence comparisons (Bonvicino et al., 2001; Cort\u00e9s-Ortiz et al., 2003) , and morphometric analyses (Bonvicino et al., 1995) provide additional evidence of genetic divergence among these four taxa.",

Apparently, the samples identified as nigerrima in published karyotypic and biochemical analyses (Armada et al., 1987; Bonvicino et al., 2001) were both taken from a captive individual of unknown provenance (C. Bonvicino, in litt. 18 May 2010) . Therefore, the correct taxonomic allocation of this nominal taxon remains to be convincingly established by analyses of properly vouchered chromosomal preparations and sequence data.",

The only specimen accompanied by external dimensions is MUSM 11108, an adult male that measured 528 3 589 3 137 3 34 mm; unfortunately, no weight was obtained from this animal. ETHNOBIOLOGY: The Matses have only one name for the howler monkey, achu, a word of uncertain etymology and one that is not synchronically segmentable. The pan-Panoan term for howler monkey is du/ru, a word with which the Matses are familiar, but which they do not consider a word in their language and therefore not a true synonym. Two or three varieties are recognized: achudapa ''big howler monkey'' (or achu piudapa ''big red howler monkey''), tsusa (a small howler monkey), and achu \u00e7h\u00eb\u015fh\u00eb ''black howler monkey.'' The first two varieties, achudapa and tsusa, are recognized by all Matses hunters, but the third, achu \u00e7h\u00eb\u015fh\u00eb (which we have never seen) is not known by all. This darker variety is reported to be red, but its underparts and the insides of its arms and legs are said to be black. It is said to live only along the upper G\u00e1 lvez. Only those Matses that recognize achu \u00e7h\u00eb\u015fh\u00eb use the term achu piudapa to contrast the red and black varieties. The term tsusa, which is not analyzable, is used to refer to the small variety, which is said to live in larger troops and to be lazier. Some speakers say that achudapa and tsusa sometimes travel together. Achu \u00e7h\u00eb\u015fh\u00eb is said to differ in habitat preference from the other two varieties because it is found in forest where the trees are all short (i.e., the white-sand habitats of the upper G\u00e1 lvez). Traditionally, only old people were permitted to eat howler monkeys. If a child or a young person eats howler monkey meat, the Matses believe they will become lazy. The small variety of howler monkey, tsusa, is worse in this respect. For this reason, Matses do not hunt howler monkeys as frequently as they do other monkeys. The lassitude induced by eating howler monkey meat can be cured with frog poison 6 and by following a special diet. In smaller villages, where game is still plentiful, howlers are not hunted at all, while in larger villages, howlers are killed more frequently, for older people to eat. Nowadays, despite disapproval from older and more traditional Matses, some younger people are ignoring this dietary taboo. Their justification is that non-Indians eat howler monkeys without any ill effect. Alternatively, some Matses say that only howlers of the tsusa variety must not be eaten. Howler monkey canines are sometimes used to make men's tooth necklaces, and young howlers are sometimes raised as pets.",

Once they stop howling, they are harder to locate, so a hunter chants ''chimu tawin tsipun tsipun'' (this is a phrase from a myth where people turned into howler monkeys by attaching a length of a vine called chimu as tails), as he walks toward the source of the howling, believing this will keep the monkeys from shutting up. When they see people, howlers that have not been exposed to hunting will come closer for a look, in which case they can be shot from the ground. Hunted animals will climb high up into a tree with vine tangles and hide in them. Howler monkeys can be found in any primary forest habitat, but they do not come to abandoned swiddens. They are found mostly in floodplain forests and in swamppalm [Mauritia flexuosa] swamps. They are also found in upland forest far from rivers, but not as frequently. They go to mineral licks to eat mud and drink muddy water, and they also descend to drink water from streams. Otherwise, they do not walk around on the ground. They sometimes forage very high up in trees. They can swim well, and troops cross rivers swimming all together, with the babies clinging onto the adults' backs.",

They are lazy, and do not move around much, and when they do, they do so slowly. Because they stay in the same place for a long time, they defecate where they hang out and there are many flies and ants around where they are, and it stinks there. They go to sleep together at dusk in trees that have many vine tangles. They have two or three places to which they always return to sleep. These sleeping sites can be identified by the smell. They always come back to the same mineral licks, where they get all dirty eating mud. They do not go to mineral licks early in the day; they go in the afternoon. One monkey stays in the trees as a lookout, while the others make a hole in the bank of the mineral lick and eat inside the hole. They do not follow a fixed route, but have a fixed territory and always come back to the same sleeping trees and mineral licks.

(Note that previous reports of spider monkeys from the Yavar\u00ed-Ucayali interfluve identified the local species as either Ateles chamek or A. paniscus for reasons explained below.) IDENTIFICATION: Kellogg and Goldman's (1944) revision of the spider monkeys recognized four polytypic species, of which two (Ateles fusciceps, A. geoffroyi) were trans-Andean endemics, one (A. paniscus) was restricted to Amazonia, and another (A. belzebuth) included both trans-Andean and Amazonian subspecies. Although Kellogg and Goldman's revision was largely based on pelage traits that some researchers (e.g., Hern\u00e1 ndez-Camacho and Cooper, 1976) have interpreted as infraspecific geographic variation, recent studies based on other kinds of data (reviewed by Collins, 2008 ) support the recognition of several valid species. The following paragraphs summarize the empirical basis for recognizing distinct species in Amazonia. Amazonian spider monkeys consist of four allopatric nominal taxa, variously recognized as valid species or subspecies by modern authors: paniscus Linnaeus, 1758, which occurs north of the Amazon and east of the Rio Negro/Rio Branco; belzebuth E. Geoffroy, 1806, which occurs north of the Amazon and west of the Negro/Branco; chamek Humboldt, 1812, which occurs south of the Amazon and west of the Tapajos; and marginatus E. Geoffroy, 1809, which occurs south of the Amazon and east of the Tapajos. Kellogg and Goldman (1944) recognized chamek as a subspecies of Ateles paniscus, and marginatus as a subspecies of A. belzebuth, but subsequent analyses of allozymic, cytogenetic, morphometric, and sequence datasets provide compelling evidence that paniscus (sensu stricto) is a distinct species, and that chamek is more closely related to belzebuth and marginatus. Although skins of belzebuth (with buffy or whitish underparts) and marginatus (with whitish facial markings) are easily distinguished from those of chamek (which are almost completely black; see below), these three taxa are craniometrically similar (Froehlich et al., 1991) , have the same diploid number of chromosomes (Medeiros et al., 1997; Nieves et al., 2005) , and have been recovered as a clade in phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial sequence data (Collins and Dubach, 2000; Collins, 2008) . Because molecular analyses that have included representative samples of belzebuth, chamek, and marginatus suggest that these coat-color phenotypes are not reciprocally monophyletic (Collins, 2008: fig. 3 .3), and in the absence of any other morphological traits known to be correlated with coat-color differences in this complex, we see no justification for recognizing chamek and marginatus as distinct species (contra Groves, 2001 Groves, , 2005 .",

Cranial measurements of our material (table 3) fall within the range of variation in homologous dimensions of western Brazilian, northeastern Bolivian, and eastern Peruvian specimens previously reported by Kellogg and Goldman (1944 [ . The spider monkey is also called by the archaic synonyms m\u00ebshe (not analyzable, but apparently containing the prefix m\u00eb-for ''hand'') and \u00e7huna wisu (5 ''black \u00e7huna''; \u00e7huna is one of the archaic names of the woolly monkey). In the language used in the Matses' komok ceremony, spider and woolly monkeys are called \u015fh\u00ebm\u00ebn kudu (these are the only primates to have a name in the ceremonial language). All Matses hunters recognize two varieties of spider monkey, which are said to never occur in the same troop. One is called ch\u00ebsh\u00ebidtapa (''big spider monkey''), and the other variety is simply called tsidu, a word that is not analyzable and is only used to refer to this variety of spider monkey. The larger spider monkey subtype has a red nose and central part of its face, and is the ''normal'' or prototypical type of spider monkey. The tsidu spider monkey is much smaller, skinnier, has an all-black face, has less or no yellow hair on its inner thighs, has a higher-pitched call, lives in much smaller troops, is less common, and is found mostly in deep rainforest very far from rivers. Some tsidu spider monkeys are believed to be demons instead of real animals, and can cause hunters to miss them repeatedly, or, if killed, can make hunters get lost on the way back home. If a tsidu spider monkey makes a hunter get lost, he must dump the dead monkey, and only then will he find his way back home. The principal economic importance of spider monkeys for the Matses is as food. Spider monkeys and woolly monkeys are the preferred primate game of the Matses. As with sloths and other large monkeys, the arm and leg bones of spider monkeys are broken (to tenderize the meat) before the carcass is bound with plaited palm leaves into a basketlike package, to which a tumpline made of a strip of bark is then attached for carrying. The normal way to cook large monkeys ($ ca. 2 kg) is to singe the hair off, remove the viscera, cut off the appendages, and boil them in a big pot. Large monkeys are also smoked when much game is killed, or on long (multiple-day) hunting trips. The canines are sometimes used to make necklaces, although the larger teeth of other atelid species are preferred. Young spider monkeys make good pets, but captive-raised animals can become aggressive when they reach adulthood. The Matses believe that hunters cannot eat or touch the intestines of spider monkeys (and other primate game species), lest they lose their marksmanship.",

How the Matses hunt spider monkeys depends on how wary the local animals are, which in turn depends on how much previous experience a troop has had with hunters. As he walks, every so often a hunter will alternately imitate the calls of spider monkeys, woolly monkeys, and capuchin monkeys, hoping that one species or another will come or at least respond by calling back. If a spider monkey troop that is not wary hears the imitations, the monkeys will respond and come to the hunter. Troops that have had no experience with people will shake branches above the hunter, bark, defecate, urinate and throw branches down at him (which they also do when they see jaguars and anteaters). Or they may simply all come and stare at the person from above. Spider monkeys that are a bit wary will come, but once the large male that leads the troop sees the hunter, it screams and all the monkeys turn around and flee. Troops that are somewhat more wary will respond vocally to the hunter's call but without approaching him, in which case the hunter seeks the monkeys in the direction from which they responded. Troops that are a bit more wary will not respond to loud imitations, so the hunter must call softly and cannot detect wary monkeys that are far away. Very wary troops simply do not respond, and the wariest will hide or move quietly and quickly in the opposite direction when they hear the hunter's call. If no spider monkeys respond, the hunter may try a brown capuchin monkey call, which may make spider (or other) monkeys vocalize, thinking that capuchins have found fruits.",

The hunter may simply imitate spider monkeys (and woolly monkeys) while walking to check if they might answer. Or he may be motivated to try the imitation upon finding dropped halfeaten fruits. Or if he comes across a sleeping tree early in the morning, he may call. When he is ready to turn back to the village, a hunter will make loud spider-, woolly-, and capuchin-monkey calls and listen for a while.

If the hunter is able to catch them by surprise, he shoots the biggest one he can get a clear shot at, and chases a second one after the rest run off. When spider monkeys flee from a hunter, they split up and go in different directions (rather than fleeing all together, as uakari monkeys do). They move through the trees extremely quickly so that the hunter must run at full speed, and try get ahead of one and shoot it as it passes overhead, or he must keep up with one until it tires out. Because females that are carrying young go the slowest, they are the most easily killed. A hunter hunting alone generally kills only one or two spider monkeys from a troop.",

Spider monkeys are hard for archers to kill because a shot monkey will pull out the arrow and keep running, dripping blood along the way. If the monkey dies without falling to the ground, the hunter must climb into the canopy to recover the carcass. If a spider monkey falls injured to the forest floor, it will try to bite any person or dog that approaches it. MATSES NATURAL HISTORY: Spider monkeys have very long limbs and tails. They hold their tails stretched out, unlike woolly and capuchin monkeys, which coil up their tails as they travel. They use their tails to grab onto things, and when they travel swinging under the branches, they use their tail as an additional limb. They hang by their tails when they eat fruit, sometimes all spread out with limbs and tail grabbing onto separate branches. Their hands have only four fingers-that is why a fork is called ''spider monkey's hand'' [a recently coined term]. In contrast to their limbs, their heads are small. Their heads have little meat to eat on them, unlike woolly monkeys'. The spider monkey's head hair looks like it was combed forward from the back; this along with its red nose makes it look silly as it sits there scratching its small head. Adult males are larger than females and have more yellow hair on their inner thighs. Spider monkeys are found in all primary forest habitats, but more often in upland forest than in floodplain forest. Spider monkeys mostly use the middle of the canopy, but often climb higher to forage, escape predators, and sleep. When they hear a tinamou fly, they climb up higher. They do not walk around or forage on the ground, unlike white-fronted capuchin monkeys, except when they go to mineral licks [see below].",

(Note that some recent reports of woolly monkeys from the Yavar\u00ed-Ucayali interfluve identify the local species as Lagothrix poeppigii; see below.) IDENTIFICATION: The genus Lagothrix was last revised by Fooden (1963) , who recognized four subspecies of L. lagothricha, of which three occur in lowland Amazonia: L. l. cana (E. Geoffroy, 1812), L. l. lagothricha (Humboldt, 1812), and L. l. poeppigii Schinz, 1844. Fooden noted that these forms are distinguishable only by coat color, explicitly remarking the absence of morphometric and qualitative osteological differences among them. To date, not a shred of additional evidence has been provided to support the notion that cana, lagothricha, and poeppigii are valid species as recently proposed by Groves (2001 Groves ( , 2005 . The species epithet of the Amazonian woolly monkey is often misspelled ''lagotricha,'' but the correct original spelling was validly fixed by Fooden (1963: 227) acting as first revisor in the sense of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN, 1999: Article 24). The FMNH series from Boca R\u00edo Yaquerana and Quebrada Esperanza were examined by Fooden (1963) , who identified the local form as Lagothrix lagothricha poeppigii. However, Matses hyponyms for woolly monkeys (see below) suggest that brownish (poeppigiilike) and grayish (cana-like) coat color phenotypes may coexist in the Yavar\u00ed-Ucayali interfluve, as they do along the Rio Juru\u00e1 (Peres, 1993a) . External and craniodental measurements of adult vouchers that we examined are summarized in table 4. Most specimens are unaccompanied by weight data, but an adult female (MUSM 11123) from Nuevo San Juan weighed 5250 g, another (MUSM 11122) weighed 6600 g, and an adult male (MUSM 11124) from the same locality weighed 7500 g.",

                "text": "ETHNOBIOLOGY: The woolly monkey is usually called poshto (not analyzable in Matses, but in neighboring Panoan languages the cognate means ''[pot] belly.'') Additionally, there are four archaic synonymous terms for woolly monkeys: \u00e7huna (the pan-Panoan term, not analyzable), abukkid ''one that is high up,'' m\u00ebdante chued ''one with big hands,'' and maksinkid ''woolly one.'' Two to three subtypes (hyponyms) are usually recognized: poshto piu ''red [-brown] woolly monkey,'' poshto tanun ''gray woolly monkey'' (or poshto u\u015fhu ''white/light-colored woolly monkey'') and poshto \u00e7h\u00eb\u015fh\u00eb ''black/ dark woolly monkey.'' The poshto piu variety has a red-brown back; the poshto tanun variety has grayish hair, and the poshto \u00e7h\u00eb\u015fh\u00eb variety has contrastingly black venter and insides of limbs. Not all Matses consider poshto \u00e7h\u00eb\u015fh\u00eb to be a distinct class, observing that either red-brown or gray woolly monkeys can have black undersides. Unlike other cases of primate overdifferentiation discussed here, most Matses do not claim that there are additional differences, such as morphological features or habitat preferences, consistently associated with these different color variants. They do, however, assert that different subtypes of woolly monkey do not occur together in the same troop. The Matses do not have a general term for ''monkey,'' but woolly monkeys can be considered the prototypical monkey, and sometimes the word poshto is used generically to mean all game monkeys, or all large (noncallitrichine) monkeys in general. All Matses eat woolly monkeys. It is a favorite food, and clearly the most appreciated primate game. Hunters cannot eat or touch the intestines of a woolly monkey (or any other monkey), lest they lose their marksmanship. As with any game species, the first time a hunter kills a woolly monkey, he cannot eat any of it, or he will lose his ability to kill woolly monkeys again. Young people (everyone under about 45 or 50) cannot eat the liver of woolly monkeys, lest their teeth fall out. Women must cook the intestines separately from the rest of the meat, and wash their hands thoroughly after touching the intestines in order to avoid contaminating the men's food. Woolly monkey canines are the preferred teeth for making men's tooth necklaces. Young woolly monkeys are often raised as pets.",

Before firearms, the mark of a top hunter was the ability to kill woolly monkeys, which are often high in the canopy and (because of their robust size) do not die unless hit in the right place. The most prestigious shot for a Matses hunter was to hit a woolly monkey in the eye with an arrow. For this reason, interviewees were all concerned with the fact that woolly monkeys are no longer killed with arrows. Furthermore, narrators expressed a common concern that woolly monkeys are now becoming scarce, especially in the vicinity of large permanent villages (traditionally, the Matses relocated their villages/ longhouses every three to seven years).",

Hunters imitate woolly monkeys by inhaling while making a very loud ''choook'' call, with hands cupped around the mouth to amplify the sound. When they find partially eaten fruit on the ground, hunters call to see if any monkey responds. If the woolly monkeys have never been hunted, they respond and come. If they are a bit wary, they respond but do not come. And if they are very wary, they do not respond or come, thought they may respond to the imitated call of a brown capuchin monkey. According to the Matses, larger troops are more confident and therefore more likely to respond than smaller troops. Those troops that have not been hunted, especially larger troops, do not run off when they see hunters. Nonhunted animals may come to look at people, and may shake branches and defecate and urinate on them. Hunters prefer to kill large adult males, and will spend some time trying to get a clear shot at the largest male. After the first shot, the monkeys sometimes split up and run in different directions, and only later rejoin. After killing the first animal, the hunter will follow a second woolly monkey, preferably a male, until it gets tired and stops to rest in a place where the hunter can get a shot. If they stop in an inaccessible place, the hunter will shoo it by shaking vines until it moves on. If a wounded animal will not move to where a hunter can get off a second shot, he will climb the tree to finish it off. A hunter will also climb up to dislodge a dead animal that is stuck up in the tree. Sometimes a woolly monkey falls to the ground while fleeing, in which case it will run on the ground a bit and then climb back up. If they are shot in the eye with an arrow or in the chest with a shotgun they fall to the ground right away. If a second or third animal is killed quickly enough, the hunter may be able to hear another one moving through trees, and will leave the killed monkey and pursue another. (Impressively, hunters always remember where they killed each monkey and take little time to gather them up and pack them into a palm-leaf carrying pack.) MATSES NATURAL HISTORY: Woolly monkeys have prehensile tails that they use for hanging onto branches. As they walk across the tops of branches, they hold their tails rolled up behind them. They are grayish or red-brown, and have black faces. They have many fleas in their genital area. Woolly monkeys are good-looking, especially the babies. The babies have sparsely haired underparts when they are first born. Woolly monkeys are found in upland forest as well as floodplain forest. They prefer upland forest far from rivers, but go to riverside forest when the water level is high. They are most common in areas with good, productive soil. They can be found in hilltop forest and forest on hilly slopes. They use all levels of the canopy, including very high up. They do not walk around on the ground, but may drop to the ground to hide among buttressed roots when an eagle is spotted. They drink water up in the trees, from bromeliads growing in crotches of trees. They tear off the fruiting structure of the bromeliads to get at the water. They do not frequent mineral licks.",

When they finish the fruits in the tree, they move on without resting, jumping across the branches, to look for more fruits. They travel far, without following a set route, jumping across the branches, noisily rustling the branches, calling to each other, with the young screaming.

(Note that some early reports of night monkeys from the Yavar\u00ed-Ucayali interfluve identified the local species as Aotus trivirgatus; see below.) IDENTIFICATION: Night monkeys exhibit a limited range of phenotypic variation, mostly in pelage traits, and all of the named forms in this genus were once considered to belong to a single geographically variable species, Aotus trivirgatus (see Hershkovitz, 1949; Cabrera, 1958) . However, subsequent karyotypic research by R.A. Brumback and N.S.F. Ma (reviewed by Hershkovitz, 1983) revealed unexpected geographic variation in diploid numbers (2n) and fundamental numbers (FN) that they interpreted as evidence for multiple species. The hypothesis that at least some night monkey karyomorphs represent valid taxa is supported by a variety of data, including correlated pelage traits, comparative serology, and clinical responses to experimental infection with malaria parasites (Hershkovitz, 1983) ; evidence of sympatry without apparent hybridization in the wild (Pieczarka et al., 1992) ; substantial mtDNA sequence divergence (Ashley and Vaughn, 1995; Plautz et al., 2009; Menezes et al., 2010) ; and reduced fertility in at least some hybrid pairings (Kumamoto and Houck, 2001 ). Together, these and other results (Ford, 1994; Defler and Bueno, 2007) effectively refute earlier notions that Aotus is monotypic, but many taxonomic issues remain unresolved. The most frequently cited phenotypic character in the recent literature on Aotus concerns the coloration of the fur of the neck. The so-called ''red-necked'' and ''graynecked'' phenotypes are defined by the presence or absence, respectively, of a lateral extension of the reddish ventral coloration along the neck below and behind the ear (Hershkovitz, 1983: fig. 1 ). Allegedly, the gray-necked forms of Aotus (for which the oldest available name is trivirgatus Humboldt, 1811) occur north of the Amazon, and red-necked forms (for which the oldest available name is azarae Humboldt, 1811) occur south of the Amazon, but Hershkovitz (1983) discussed some exceptions to this geographic pattern and others are indicated by specimens that we examined (see below). Although neck coloration is commonly used as the basis for recognizing species groups of Aotus (e.g., by Hershkovitz, 1983; Ford, 1994; Groves, 2001 ), recent sequencing studies do not support the reciprocal monophyly of gray-necked and red-necked night monkeys (Plautz et al., 2009; Menezes et al., 2010) .",

According to Hershkovitz (1983) , unvouchered night monkey karyotypes prepared by N.S.F. Ma from blood samples obtained at Peruvian localities on the south (right) bank of the Amazon (including the Yavar\u00ed-Ucayali interfluve) all have 54 chromosomes and 72 autosomal arms (2n 5 54, FN 5 72), whereas most karyotypes from the north (left) bank of the Peruvian Amazon have 2n 5 46 and FN 5 60. Hershkovitz (1983) attributed divergent pelage traits to these karyotypes by examining skins from north-bank and south-bank Peruvian localities. He identified the north-bank 2n 5 46 karyotype as belonging to the gray-necked species Aotus vociferans (Spix, 1823), and he described a new species of red-necked night monkey, A. nancymaae (originally misspelled nancymai; see Groves, 2001 ) for the southbank 2n 5 54 karyotype. However, an allegedly unique enclave of red-necked night monkeys with 2n 5 54 chromosomes (also referred to A. nancymaae) occurs along the lower R\u00edo Tigre, a north-bank tributary of the Amazon (Hershkovitz, 1983: fig. 9 ).",

Instead, FMNH 123032 and 123033 are probably two of the three Johns Hopkins specimens karyotyped by Brumback (1973) , who said they were collected in ''the Leticia, Colombia-Iquitos, Peru area of the Amazon Basin south [sic] of the Andes mountains'' (op. cit.: 285).",

Hershkovitz (1983) admitted that nancymaae and miconax might be conspecific, and subsequent morphological analyses (Ford, 1994) have failed to discover any phenotypic trait that distinguishes them, but the karyotype of miconax is unknown. Although it would be reasonable to conclude on the basis of morphology that miconax is a senior synonym that should replace nancymaae as the oldest available name for the night monkeys of the Yavar\u00ed-Ucayali interfluve, we prefer to maintain existing usage and await karyotypic data from Andean foothill populations to support or refute this hypothesis. Puertas and Bodmer (1993) suggested that Aotus nigriceps (another allegedly distinct red-necked species) might occur in the Reserva Comunal Tamshiyacu-Tahuayofrom which they also reported A. nancymaae-but noted that the species had only been recorded from vocalizations. In the absence of corroborating details, their identification is difficult to evaluate, but sympatry between congeneric species of night monkeys is not implausible (as noted above). Future primatological fieldworkers in the area should take care to record unusual vocalizations and (ideally) collect voucher specimens of locally co-occurring taxa.",

The term dide is the one usually overheard in everyday conversation, and diku is used mostly in myths. There is some controversy among the Matses as to whether diku is a synonym of dide or a less-commonly encountered subtype (different from dide). The Matses eat night monkeys, but because the Matses traditionally did not hunt at night, and night monkeys are rarely encountered in the day, they were infrequently killed. Now that the Matses hunt at night with flashlights and shotguns (mainly for pacas, deer, tapirs, and caimans), they could kill night monkey more easily, but since night monkeys are small, the Matses are seldom willing to expend a shotgun shell to kill one. The Matses kill night monkeys opportunistically when the animals are detected at dawn entering tree holes, or when a monkey sticks its head out of its hole as a hunter passes by during the day. In the latter case, the hunter will shake vines and saplings to see if the animal exits the hole; if it does, the hunter will shoot from the ground. If the monkey stays inside its hole, the hunter may climb up a neighboring tree, make a bit of noise, and then shoot it when it sticks its head out again. If not, the hunter might climb the tree, plug the hole, and later return later with an axe to fell the tree or enlarge the hole to get the monkey(s) out.",

They have a gray body with a red chest, and a black tail-tip. They are the size of a squirrel monkey. They live in small troops of about four individuals. They call saying ''ii ii ii ii'' [the vocalization attributed to night monkeys in traditional Matses ceremonial chants, not a phonetically accurate rendition of actual calls]. They are active at night and sleep in the day. They can see in the dark and forage for fruits in the dark. They sleep in holes in dicot trees and palm trees. They do not always sleep in the same hole. When they see that the day is dawning, they go inside their hole. Then at dusk they come out again.",

Fleck, unpublished) , R\u00edo Blanco , Santa Cecilia (Hershkovitz, 1977) , Tapiche (Jorge and Velazco, 2006 (Thomas, 1904 (Thomas, , 1913 Hershkovitz, 1977) . The collector, Harvey Bassler (a petroleum geologist; Myers, 2000) , recorded no external measurements, and the skull has been bisected longitudinally for anatomical study; as a result, transverse cranial measurements cannot be taken. However, other craniodental dimensions of this specimen, including condyloincisive length (CIL, 41.0 mm) and length of the maxillary toothrow (C1-M3, 15.4 mm) are within the published range of variation for Callimico goeldii (see Hershkovitz, 1977 : appendix table 2). REMARKS: No other western Amazonian callitrichine is completely black, so unvouchered reports by competent observers have high credibility. Our sighting at Nuevo San Juan (of a small troop moving through secondary vegetation close to the ground on the right bank of the R\u00edo G\u00e1 lvez) was unambiguous, and several other sight records from the region seem trustworthy. Izawa (1979: 5) reported that ''Callimico occurs as a relatively high population from the head to the upper basin of the R\u00edo Blanco, a [right-bank] tributary of the R\u00edo Tapiche.'' Izawa also observed Callimico along the upper R\u00edo Tapiche, but did not specify on which bank(s) his observations were made. (Additional information from Izawa's primatological survey of the Tapiche-Blanco is apparently available in a Japanese-language publication that we have not seen [Izawa, 1978] ). Recently, however, Jorge and Velazco (2006) reported Callimico at an inventory site on the right bank of the upper Tapiche. Hershkovitz (1977: 928) attributed the Santa Cecilia sighting to the late Pekka Soini, whose correspondence (dated 28 June 1970) is still preserved in the FMNH Division of Mammals' archives. In fact, Soini did not explicitly mention Santa Cecilia, but stated that Callimico goeldii ''seems to be definitely known \u2026 to some natives along the Maniti river.'' Santa Cecilia is a small community on the right (east) bank of the lower Manit\u00ed (Robbins et al., 1991) , a site where Soini might plausibly have interviewed local informants. Subsequent primate census work along the R\u00edo Manit\u00ed, however, has not produced additional records of this elusive species (Tapia et al., 1990) . ETHNOBIOLOGY: A few Matses talk about a monkey called sipi \u00e7h\u00eb\u015fh\u00eb ''black tamarin,'' which is said to be different from tamarins, extremely rare, all black (including the area around its mouth), and to forage on the ground and very close to the ground. However, most Matses have never seen this species. UNVOUCHERED REPORTS: Chonc\u00f3 (Amanzo, 2006) , Reserva Comunal Tamshiyacu-Tahuayo (Puertas and Bodmer, 1993; Heymann and Aquino, 1994) , R\u00edo Aucayo (Castro and Soini, 1977) , R\u00edo Tapiche (Bennett et al., 2001) , R\u00edo Yavar\u00ed (left bank below Angamos; Salovaara et al., 2003) , R\u00edo Yavar\u00ed-Mir\u00edm (Salovaara et al., 2003) . IDENTIFICATION: The pygmy marmoset (formerly Cebuella pygmaea) was last reviewed in substantive detail by Hershkovitz (1977) , who recognized only Spix's epithet as valid, treating niveiventris L\u00f6 nnberg, 1940, as a strict synonym. However, other authors (e.g., Cruz Lima, 1945; Cabrera, 1958; Napier, 1976; Roosmalen and Roosmalen, 1997; Groves, 2001 Groves, , 2005 ) have treated C. p. pygmaea and C. p. niveiventris as valid subspecies distinguishable by ventral fur color. Roosmalen and Roosmalen (1997) mapped these nominal taxa as allopatrically distributed north and south of the Amazon, respectively. Spix's original material of pygmaea (the holotype, preserved in the Zoologischen Staatssamlung M\u00fc nchen; Kraft, 1983) was collected at Tabatinga, on the north (left) bank of the Amazon just upstream from the mouth of the Yavar\u00ed, 9 whereas L\u00f6 nnberg's material of niveiventris (two syntypes in the Naturhistoriska Riksmuseet, Stockholm) was collected at Lago Ipixuna, about halfway between the Juru\u00e1 and the Purus on the south (right) bank of the river. We have not examined the type material of either taxon, but specimens from the Yavar\u00ed-Ucayali interfluve more closely resemble niveiventris by virtue of their mostly whitish underparts, by contrast with specimens from the adjacent north bank of the Amazon (e.g., AMNH 74360-74370), which have grizzled-brownish underparts (resembling those of typical pygmaea according to Hershkovitz, 1977) . Ventral fur color does not, however, consistently distinguish specimens from opposite banks of the Amazon, and we agree with Hershkovitz (1977) that subspecific nomenclature does not usefully describe any currently recognized pattern of geographic variation among museum specimens of pygmy marmosets. Unfortunately, molecular data suggesting a high degree of genetic divergence within C. pygmaea were all obtained from captive individuals of unknown geographic origin (Tagliaro et al., 2000) . External and craniodental measurements of specimens we examined from the Yavar\u00ed-Ucayali interfluve are provided in They climb on trees and vines in any forest type. They always return to the same large, smooth-barked trees where they feed. They spend most of their time hanging on the trunks of these large trees. They can be found high or low in the forest. They vocalize saying ''pss pss'' as if they were giggling. When they see people, they hide on the opposite side of the trunk. They only move about in the daytime.",

When they see a troop of tamarins, they wait until a mother sets her offspring on a branch to feed it, and then they spook the animals by yelling, and by shaking vines and saplings.

Moustached tamarins use higher levels of the forest than saddleback tamarins, but neither uses the highest levels of the canopy. Saddleback tamarins sometimes forage on the ground. They can both be found in all habitats, but moustached tamarins are more closely associated with primary forest, where there are many tall trees, whereas saddleback tamarins prefer thick, viney vegetation in secondary forest, in abandoned swiddens, and in old blowdowns. Saddleback tamarins are often seen at the edges of swiddens. [One narrator went further, claiming that moustached tamarins are never found in secondary forest, and that saddleback tamarins are only found in secondary forest.] Saddleback tamarins sometimes come to swiddens where they eat ripe plantains or papayas.",

Additionally, S. fuscicollis and S. nigricollis are not reciprocally monophyletic (whether or not tripartitus, graellsi, and/or melanoleucus are also recognized as full species), and pairwise genetic distances are generally lower within this complex than they are among most other currently recognized tamarin species (Cropp et al., 1999; Matauschek et al., 2011) . Pending a taxonomically comprehensive revision of the Saguinus nigricollis group that takes newly discovered facts about genetic sequence variation, geographic distributions, and hybridization into account, we follow Hershkovitz's (1977) nomenclature, but two plausible outcomes of future revisionary work could affect the nomenclature of populations in the Yavar\u00ed-Ucayali interfluve.

The first four are listed above as vouchers, but the latter two (AMNH 98286, 98287) were alleged by Hershkovitz (1977) to have been collected on the opposite (north) bank of the Amazon. In the absence of any other material of lagonotus from south-bank localities, Hershkovitz's hypothesis that AMNH 98286 and 98287 were mislabeled seems plausible because other vertebrate specimens that passed through the hands of Harvey Bassler are likewise associated with problematic locality data (Wiley, 2010 UNVOUCHERED OBSERVATIONS: Actiam\u00eb (Amanzo, 2006) , Chonc\u00f3 (Amanzo, 2006) , Itia T\u00ebbu (Amanzo, 2006) , Jenaro Herrera (Aquino, 1978) , Reserva Comunal Tamshiyacu-Tahuayo (Puertas and Bodmer, 1993; Heymann and Aquino, 1994) , R\u00edo Aucayo (Castro and Soini, 1977) , R\u00edo Yavar\u00ed (left bank below Angamos; Salovaara et al., 2003) , R\u00edo Yavar\u00ed-Mir\u00edm (Salovaara et al., 2003) , Tapiche (Jorge and Velazco, 2006) .

Most Matses speakers do not list chidu as part of the ''official'' game synonym set for capuchins (Fleck and Voss, 2006) , but consider it a synonym reserved for telling myths. Other Matses insist that, because it is a legitimate and archaic name, it should not be excluded when listing game synonyms. Two types of capuchin monkey are universally recognized by the Matses: b\u00ebchun \u00e7h\u00eb\u015fh\u00eb ''black/dark-colored capuchin'' (the brown capuchin, Cebus apella) and b\u00ebchun u\u015fhu ''white/light-colored capuchin'' (the white-fronted capuchin, Cebus albifrons).

Matses hunters detect capuchin monkeys when they hear them knocking hard fruits against branches, or when they hear vocalizations or the noise of rustling branches as the monkeys travel through the canopy. When a Matses hunter imitates capuchin calls, the monkeys usually respond loudly but seldom actually come toward the hunter. When capuchins are being chased, they sometimes drop to the ground and run on the ground. When this happens, dogs will try to catch them, but capuchin monkeys are strong and easily kill dogs by biting them. Hunters must be ready to kill capuchin monkeys fighting with their hunting dogs, but capuchins also bite people if they are carelessly approached.",

IDENTIFICATION: The last morphological revision of Cebus was by Hill (1960) , who reviewed the tediously complex and unedifying nomenclatural history of this difficult genus. Most students of capuchin taxonomy (e.g., Elliot, 1913; Hershkovitz, 1949; Hill, 1960) have emphasized the distinction between ''tufted'' and ''untufted'' species based on the presence or absence of tufts or crests of coronal fur in adult males (additional characters diagnosing these groups were tabulated by Hershkovitz, 1949) . As far as known, no local fauna anywhere in the Neotropics has more than one species of tufted capuchin or more than one untufted species, whereas tufted and untufted capuchins occur sympatrically throughout much of Amazonia. Thus, the distinction seems important, and Silva (2002) recently proposed that these groups be formally recognized as subgenera: Cebus Erxleben, 1777, for the untufted species; and Sapajus Kerr, 1792, for the tufted species. At least some genetic evidence suggests that these might, in fact, be reciprocally monophyletic taxa (Casado et al., 2010) . The untufted capuchin of western Amazonia, Cebus albifrons, has been divided into a number of subspecies by authors. Based on mapped geographic ranges in Hershkovitz (1949) and Hill (1960) , the population inhabiting the Yavar\u00ed-Ucayali interfluve is assign-able to C. a. unicolor (Spix, 1823), the type locality of which is Tef\u00e9 (on the south bank of the Amazon between the Juru\u00e1 and the Purus), Amazonas, Brazil. However, Defler and Hern\u00e1 ndez-Camacho (2002) argued that Spix's unicolor is phenotypically indistinguishable from the nominotypical race, the type locality of which (fixed by neotype selection) is ''about 10 km north of Maypures \u2026 Vichada, Colombia'' (op. cit.: 54). Our voucher material is somewhat darker and duller than the color illustration of the neotype of C. a. albifrons (in Defler and Hern\u00e1 ndez-Camacho, 2002 ), but we remain unconvinced of the need for trinomial nomenclature to distinguish minor pelage differences among Amazonian populations of this species. Measurements of specimens collected in the Yavar\u00ed-Ucayali interfluve (table 10) are slightly larger than most homologous dimensions of topotypical C. a. albifrons (in Defler and Hern\u00e1 ndez-Camacho, 2002) , but sample sizes are too small for confident inference.",

IDENTIFICATION: The many nominal taxa of tufted capuchins-which collectively range from northern Colombia to northern Argentina-were all treated as synonyms or subspecies of the brown capuchin (Cebus apella) by Hershkovitz (1949) and Hill (1960) , but some are now recognized as valid species by authors (e.g., Groves, 2001 Groves, , 2005 Silva, 2002; Rylands et al., 2005) . Unfortunately, the revisionary studies alleged to support the recognition of distinct species of tufted capuchin have never been published, the only published diagnoses (based on trivial sample sizes; Groves, 2001) are not useful for specimen identification, ''undeniable evidence of some natural interbreeding'' is admitted to exist (Groves, 2001: 152) , and genetic distances among some ''species'' are unimpressive (e.g., 1.3% between cytochrome-b sequences of C. apella and C. ''cay''; Casado et al., 2010) . Therefore, a compelling case for recognizing multiple valid species among the nominal taxa traditionally regarded as synonyms or subspecies of C. apella has yet to be made. In particular, we are not convinced that any tufted species other than the brown capuchin inhabits Amazonian rainforests. According to Hill (1960) , the subspecies of Cebus apella in the Yavar\u00ed-Ucayali interfluve is macrocephalus Spix, 1823 (type locality ''Lago Cactu\u00e1 ,'' presumably somewhere on the Brazilian Amazon), but geographically adjacent forms include juruanus L\u00f6 nnberg, 1939 (type locality Jo\u00e3 o Pess\u00f4 a on the Rio Juru\u00e1 , Brazil) and peruanus Thomas, 1901 (type locality Huaynapata, Cusco, Peru). In fact, representative skins from the Yavar\u00ed-Ucayali interfluve plausibly fit Grove's (2001) descriptions of each of these nominal taxa. Some (AMNH 268240), for example, have more or less distinct blackish middoral stripes (as described for macrocephalus and juruanus), whereas others (AMNH 73989) lack any trace of a black middorsal stripe (resembling peruanus in this and other respects). Cabrera (1958) treated both juruanus and peruanus as synonyms of C. a. macrocephalus, an arrangement that is consistent with our suspicion that all western Amazonian tufted capuchins are taxonomically indistinguishable.",

Saimiri boliviensis and S. sciureus have both been reported from the Yavar\u00ed-Ucayali interfluve. Based on his examination of museum specimens, Hershkovitz (1984) reported that S. boliviensis and S. sciureus occur sympatrically west of the R\u00edo Tapiche, whereas only S. sciureus occurs east of the Tapiche. Puertas and Bodmer (1993) , however, reported unvouchered sightings of both species from the Reserva Comunal Tamshiyacu-Tahuayo (along the Quebrada Blanco and the R\u00edo Yavar\u00ed-Mir\u00edm), and Bennett et al. (2001) reported unvouchered sightings of S. boliviensis from both banks of the Tapiche. Given the discrepancy between Hershkovitz's specimen-based observations and the unvouchered observations of fieldworkers, the external characters by which S. boliviensis and S. sciureus can be distinguished are obviously relevant for assessing the reliability of sight identifications.",

Two subtypes are recognized: tsankadapa ''big squirrel monkey'' and tsankampi ''little squirrel monkey.'' The larger variety is said to have whitish arms and to live in smaller troops (or alone), while the small variety is said to have bright yellow arms and to live in larger troops. The small variety is said to be more common in river-edge forest than the larger variety. The smaller variety is said to be the only one found to travel together with brown capuchin monkeys. Very long ago, the Matses did not eat squirrel monkeys, lest they become thin (like a squirrel monkey). More recently, perhaps even before contact with missionaries, Matses began to eat squirrel monkeys, but as with titi monkeys, hunters usually do not make a special effort to find them because they are small. A Matses hunter may listen to their noisy rustling of branches, and then try to get a shot off before they see him. After the first shot, the hunter may chase the troop making them run through the trees until one pauses on a relatively low branch, when the hunter can shoot it with an arrow or shotgun. The Matses consider squirrel monkeys to be very abundant, easy to kill, and tasty, but nevertheless hunters do not often kill them.",

However, Matses who come from places where there are no uakari monkeys (e.g., along the Chobayacu), do not eat them saying ''My father did not eat those,'' as their justification. Many Matses that live outside the range of uakari monkeys are not familiar with them, and it is likely that, as the Matses moved around in the past, they did not continuously live in areas inhabited by uakaris. This may explain the lack of linguistic attention and the absence of uakari monkeys in Matses myths. The canines of large male uakari monkeys are used to make men's tooth necklaces.",

When animals from a hunted troop see humans, they slowly move toward the upper canopy and/or move slowly away. When they hear a firearm report, they move away faster, but even then they do not seem to be too scared. Unlike spider monkeys, uakaris do not split up when they run away from hunters, but run in the same direction. Therefore, a good, solitary Matses hunter can easily kill several animals at a single encounter with a troop. They are packed for carrying and cooked in the same way as woolly and spider monkeys.

They may split up to find fruit, and rejoin to eat together when a large amount of fruit is found. They sleep near each other in the branches of dicot trees. When they are not hunted, they ignore humans, or come down closer to the ground to look at them. Even troops that are hunted are not very scared of humans.",

(Note that some reports of Callicebus from the Yavar\u00ed-Ucayali interfluve have identified the local species as C. caligatus or C. moloch; see below.) IDENTIFICATION: The Amazonian forms of Callicebus (titi monkeys) were revised by Hershkovitz (1963) , who recognized only two valid species, C. moloch and C. torquatus. However, Hershkovitz (1990) and Groves (2001) subsequently recognized 12 Amazonian species, and Roosmalen et al. (2002) recognized 22 Amazonian species that they assigned to four species groups. 13 Although most taxonomic diagnoses in this literature are based on coat-color differences, there is some evidence that the species groups recognized by Roosmalen et al. (2002) are morphometrically differentiated and have distinctive karyotypes (Kobayashi, 1995) . Unfortunately, the karyotypes of many alleged species are unknown, and molecular evidence supporting the recognition of distinct taxa within species groups is almost nonexistent. Hershkovitz (1963) referred all of the Callicebus specimens he examined from the Yavar\u00ed-Ucayali interfluve to the subspecies C. moloch cupreus, but he later (Hershkovitz, 1990) identified some specimens of titi monkeys from the Yavar\u00ed-Ucayali interfluve as C. cupreus and others from the same region as C. caligatus. A small series of AMNH specimens from Orosa was listed among the material examined for both species in the latter publication, and an accompanying map (Hershkovitz, 1990: fig. 36 ) showed C. cupreus and C. caligatus as occurring sympatrically at Orosa. Later, Hershkovitz (personal commun., 1995) explained that this was an error caused by listing original and revised identifications of the same specimens in separate species accounts.",

(2002) , only Callicebus cupreus inhabits the Yavar\u00ed-Ucayali interfluve, but some of our specimens more closely resemble their diagnosis of C. caligatus, particularly with respect to the presence of a blackish forehead and lower crown as described above. Additionally, the basal part of the tail is blackish in some of our specimens (e.g., AMNH 73703) and others (e.g., AMNH 268239) have extensively pale-tipped tails, both traits associated with C. caligatus rather than C. cupreus in their diagnoses. In effect, our material combines traits of both species as recognized by these authors, who do not list any material examined, and whose illustrations do not correspond closely with their text. 14 We are not convinced that Callicebus caligatus or any of the other nominal taxa belonging to the Cupreus Group of Kobayashi (1995) and Roosmalen et al. (2002) including C. caquetensis, C. discolor, C. dubius, C. ornatus, C. stephennashi, and probably C. aureipalati-are valid species distinct from C. cupreus. Although these forms collectively range across most of western Amazonia, they resemble one another in pelage markings (see Roosmalen et al., 2002: fig. 49; Defler et al., 2010: fig. 5; Wallace et al., 2006: figs. 4, 5) , and at least some allegedly diagnostic differences seem to break down when large series of specimens (as opposed to just a few exemplars) are examined. Additionally, nonpelage differences among these taxa appear to be wanting: all analyzed forms are morphometrically similar (Kobayashi, 1995) , have the same diploid number of chromosomes (2n 5 46; Roosmalen et al., 2002; Defler et al., 2010) , and seem to occupy the same ecological niche (inhabiting forest edges and disturbed vegetation; Roosmalen et al., 2002 ). Because no verifiable examples of sympatry are known among nominal species in this group, it is plausible that these taxa represent nothing more than geographic coat-color variants of the same biological species, a hypothesis that merits future evaluation with molecular sequence data and with targeted collecting in areas where different coat-color phenotypes might be expected to come in contact.",

Most specimens are unaccompanied by weight data, but an adult male (MUSM 11116) from Nuevo San Juan weighed 1020 g, and an adult female (AMNH 268239) from the same locality weighed 1042 g. ETHNOBIOLOGY: The Matses call the titi monkey wad\u00eb, which is not linguistically analyzable. It has three other supposedly ancient synonyms, tsokon, s\u00ebd\u00eb, and masoko. The first synonym is onomatopoetic and unique to Matses. The other two are of uncertain etymology: both occur in neighboring Mayoruna languages, and therefore could easily be either borrowings or truly archaic words. Some Matses assert that masoko is not archaic, but a borrowing; there is no controversy about the other two names. Two subtypes are recognized, wad\u00eb piu ''red titi monkey'' and wad\u00eb \u00e7h\u00eb\u015fh\u00eb ''black (dark-colored) titi monkey.'' The first is the commonly seen variety, which is found close to rivers. The second variety is reported to live in upland forest far from rivers, where the red variety is absent. Not all Matses hunters are familiar with the darker variety or accept that two varies exist. Those that claim to have seen the darker variety do not know much about it. (Despite a considerable effort to find it, the darker variety was not collected during our mammal inventory at Nuevo San Juan; it probably represents another case of overdifferentiation of a single biological species.) Matses eat titi monkeys, but because they are small, hunters usually do not make a special effort to find them. Traditionally, as larger game became scarce in a locality, more titi monkeys would be killed. Nowadays, most hunters will not expend a shotgun shell to kill one despite the shortage of game around the larger and more permanent villages. One way to kill titi monkeys is to simply shoot them from the ground. Another way is to climb up at tree where the titi monkeys are hiding. When the titi monkeys see the hunter up in the tree, they will usually drop and flee running on the ground, where waiting hunting dogs and/or a second hunter will chase them down and kill them. Matses do not imitate their call to hunt them.",

Titi monkeys can be found in any forest type, but they strongly prefer habitats that have open canopies [i.e., where light shines through to the understory], such as abandoned swiddens, riverside forest, and secondary forest at blowdowns. When there are abundant ripe legume pods growing along rivers [November-January], titi monkeys are especially common there. They are not found very high up in the trees. They descend to the ground occasionally to drink water, eat insects or fruits, or to cross a swidden.",

IDENTIFICATION: Saki monkeys from the Yavar\u00ed-Ucayali interfluve were referred to Pithecia hirsuta by Hershkovitz (1979) , but subsequent study of type material led Hershkovitz (1987c) to identify the same specimens as P. monachus. Although all of our material is referable to P. monachus as that taxon was briefly distinguished in Hershkovitz's (1987c) key, the taxonomic significance of phenotypic variation among western Amazonian populations of sakis remains to be convincingly established. Because our series from Nuevo San Juan (N 5 26 adult specimens) is the largest sample available to document morphological variation within a local population of any Pithecia species, we provide a detailed description below. The 11 adult male skins from the R\u00edo G\u00e1 lvez exhibit limited variation in pelage characters. The dorsal body pelage and the pelage of the outer surfaces of the arms and legs is predominantly blackish, but the individual hairs have pale tips that produce a frosted mass effect; specimens with long, whitish hair tips (e.g., MUSM 11126) appear more heavily frosted than individuals with shorter, yellowish, or brownish terminal bands (MUSM 11142). The distinctive ruff or mane surrounding the head does not contrast in coloration with the rest of the body fur. The hands are distinctly paler than the arms, appearing whitish in most individuals, but the bases of the individual hairs on the hands are always dark. Most specimens also have whitish feet, but a few (e.g., MUSM 11128, 11129, 11145) have grizzled pedal fur that is not conspicuously paler than the fur of the thigh and shank.",

According to Hershkovitz, taxa within this group are distinguishable only by pelage traits. In the comparative material we examined, the distinguishing external characters of all the saki species recognized by Hershkovitz are readily apparent, at least in adult males; by his classification, our vouchers are unambiguously referable to P. monachus. By contrast, P. irrorata (which occurs south of the Amazon between the Juru\u00e1 and the Tapaj\u00f3 s; Hershkovitz, 1987c) has an almostnaked head, the exposed blackish skin of which is conspicuously set off by an encircling white-fringed ruff. Another geographically adjacent form, P. aequatorialis (which occurs north of the Amazon between the Tigre and the Napo; Bravo and R\u00edos, 2007; Aquino et al., 2009) has long reddish or red-based fur on the cheeks (resembling the mutton-chop whiskers of 19th-century gentlemen) and a conspicuously reddish chest. Pending a comprehensive analysis of character variation in the monachus group, these and other character differences seem sufficient to maintain the nominal taxa recognized by Hershkovitz as distinct, but whether or not these should be recognized as full species remains to be convincingly demonstrated. 15 In the event that a trinomi-al classification is judged to better represent the situation, our material from Nuevo San Juan would be referable to the nominotypical form P. monachus monachus.",

Two subtypes are recognized by the Matses: mamu (with no meaning in Matses, but in closely related languages it means ''pitch,'' a black adhesive made of beeswax and tree latex) and b\u00ebshudu (not analyzable, except possibly the prefix b\u00eb-''face/forehead''). The mamu variety is said to be larger, have a whiter face, whiter hands, and a bushier coat, while the b\u00ebshudu variety is said to be smaller, to have a black or darker face, less white on its hands and a thinner coat. Troops of mamu are said to be found more frequently in upland habitats far from large rivers, and b\u00ebshudu more frequently along rivers. A minority of Matses hunters do not recognize two varieties and consider mamu and b\u00ebshudu to be synonyms of b\u00eb\u015fhuidkid. Fleck et al. (1999) discussed this ethnobiological issue in detail and summarized morphological and genetic evidence that the Matses overdifferentiate saki monkeys. All Matses eat sakis. As with other monkeys, sakis are cooked by first singing the hair off and then boiling them; likewise, men cannot eat or touch the intestines. Children usually eat the head. The Matses believe that if they give a dog a saki monkey bone, the dog will die; therefore, they are always mindful of this when disposing of the bones.",

Saki monkeys can drop to the ground without hurting themselves. Saki monkeys are found in all types of habitats, in upland forest and floodplain forest, in primary forest and in blowdowns. They travel high or low in the trees.",

Additionally, most primates are relatively large, eurytopic, highly mobile, visually oriented, social, diurnal, frugivorous, and arboreal. The extent to which this unique ensemble of ecobehavioral traits may have influenced primate biogeography, our ability (as taxonomists) to detect phenotypic differ-ences among primate taxa, or the Matses' ability (as hunters) to learn primate habits is unknown, but it seems unlikely that valid inferences about the entire mammalian fauna can be based on information summarized above.

Nevertheless, unconfirmed reports of other taxa (e.g., Saimiri boliviensis and Aotus nigriceps in the Reserva Comunal Tamshiyaco-Tahuayo; Puertas and Bodmer, 1993) merit the attention of future researchers, who should collect specimens to voucher any new records.",

The white-sand forests of the upper G\u00e1 lvez/R\u00edo Blanco, for example, seem likely to have relatively depauperate primate faunas; only eight species were recorded at the single surveyed site in this habitat (Amanzo, 2006) .",

All of these western Amazonian faunas share a core assemblage of six widespread species that include Alouatta seniculus, Lagothrix lagothricha, Callithrix pygmaea, Cebus albifrons, Cebus apella, and Pithecia monachus. A seventh widespread species, Ateles belzebuth, is (inexplicably) absent only in the Napo-Putumayo interfluve. Other shared taxa include Aotus and Saimiri, which are represented in each region by geographically replacing species. Each region also has at least one member of the Saguinus nigricollis group (sensu Hershkovitz, 1977;  including S. fuscicollis) and one member of the Callicebus cupreus group (sensu Roosmalen et al., 2002;  including C. discolor). By contrast, other primate taxa have more restricted distributions: Saguinus mystax (which belongs to a different species group than S. fuscicollis and S. nigricollis) and Cacajao calvus are only found south of the Mara\u00f1 \u00f3 n/Amazon, members of the Callicebus torquatus group (sensu Roosmalen et al., 2002: including C. lucifer and C. regulus) do not occur between the Yavar\u00ed and the Mara\u00f1 \u00f3 n, and Pithecia aequatorialis only occurs between the Mar-a\u00f1 \u00f3 n and the Napo. Callimico goeldii has a poorly documented distribution; in northeastern Peru it is only known to occur in the Yavar\u00ed-Ucayali, Ucayali-Mara\u00f1 \u00f3 n, and Mara\u00f1 \u00f3 n-Napo interfluves. As a consequence of these distributional phenomena, the primate fauna of the Yavar\u00ed-Ucayali interfluve is unique, conspicuously differing from faunas on the north bank of the Mara\u00f1\u00f3 n/Amazon by having uakaris and two sympatric species of tamarins, and from adjacent south-bank faunas east of the Yavar\u00ed by lacking collared titis (species of the Callithrix torquatus complex). The primate fauna of the Yavar\u00ed-Ucayali interfluve is most similar to In the absence of any existing convention for naming Amazonian interfluvial regions, we do so counterclockwise from the southeast (see figure 1) .

However, like many other native Amazonians, the Matses are selective about the monkey species they consume, strongly preferring some and avoiding others (table 18). Additionally, some Matses dietary preferences reflect common trends in primate consumption by native Amazonians, who usually prize large species (especially those that get fat from eating fruit in the rainy season), but who often avoid eating Alouatta when other atelids are locally available (Cormier, 2007) . Although it is tempting to seek utilitarian explanations for the Matses' traditional proscriptions about what species and organs may not be eaten, and by whom, cross-site comparisons of Amazonian dietary taboos suggest that these may be nothing more than superstitions or culinary prejudices subsidized by the local abundance of game (Jerozolimski and Peres, 2003) . In other words, the Matses (like the Matsigenka; Shepard, 2002) can afford to be picky eaters because there is plenty of meat to go around.",

                "text": "Whereas hunting for food is obviously the primary motivation for Matses men-from whom all of our interviews were obtainedto learn as much as possible about the habits of preferred game species, some species are occasionally hunted to obtain ornaments or pets. Boyhood memories of stalking tamarins (the secondary growth surrounding Matses villages is routinely patrolled by gangs of juvenile archers) and nonpredatory encounters with primates throughout a lifetime spent in close proximity to the forest (titis call from the edges of clearings at dawn, howlers roar at the full moon every month, and other species are often seen foraging in riverside vegetation by canoe travelers) doubtless also contribute to the available fund of adult knowledge. Information gained at second hand may also be important. The habits of game animals are popular topics of male conversation in Matses society, and the sights and sounds of the day's hunt are often told over the evening meal. By such informal but Matses knowledge about primates varies considerably in recorded details, and this variation is clearly correlated with cultural importance and physical size. The composite essay for Ateles belzebuth, a preferred game species and the largest monkey in Matses territory, for example, can be parsed into 86 observations about its ecology and/or behavior (see below), whereas the composite essay for Callithrix pygmaea, a tiny nongame species, contains only nine observations about these topics. The ecobehavioral information content of composite essays about other taxa reflects the same trend: many more observations were provided about the habits of such large and/or culturally salient monkeys as Lagothrix lagothricha and Alouatta seniculus than about small species of little cultural significance (e.g., Aotus nancymaae, Saguinus spp.). Clearly, the Matses are more strongly motivated to observe some species than others.",

                "text": "Nevertheless, the range of recorded information, even for some of the smaller monkeys, is impressive. The Matses routinely provided species-specific information about habitat and microhabitat use, group size and composition, other aspects of social behavior, vocalizations, and diet. The latter category is especially rich in recorded details, often including long lists of commonly consumed items. Of particular interest are observations of phenomena rarely observed by field biologists, such as predation and predator-avoidance behavior. Assessing the reliability of all this information is obviously important for a variety of potential applications, so we undertook a detailed analysis of one exemplar taxon. SPIDER MONKEY NATURAL HISTORY: We analyzed recorded monologs about spider monkeys by enumerating units of ecobeha-vioral information that could be checked for consistency against the scientific literature (after Townsend, 1995) . Because there have been relatively few field studies of the local species, Ateles belzebuth, we regarded Matses observations as corroborated by the scientific literature if similar observations had been published by field biologists for any spider monkey species. Also, because some field studies provide incomplete taxonomic identifications of ingested fruits, we assessed dietary information about food plants at the generic level. Of the 86 ecobehavioral information units tallied from Matses monologs about Ateles belzebuth, two concerned unidentified plant taxa in its diet: \u015fhanned (possibly corresponding to one or more species of Brosimum [Moraceae]) and okodo mabis (an undetermined species of Guttiferae). As no confident assessment of these dietary items is possible in the absence of positive botanical matches, they were excluded from consideration. Of the remaining 84 ecobehavioral information units, 63 (75%) were corroborated by published information from scientific field studies (table 19) . These corroborated observations include traits that are common to all spider monkey species, such as tail-assisted brachiation (item 3) and frugivory (item 59), as well as behaviors that could be species or site specific. Examples of species-specific traits might be the complex of behaviors associated with visiting mineral licks (items 48-56), which are apparently unknown in other well-studied congeners; another might be the habit of eating unpeeled fruits (item 61), a behavior that is apparently not shared with A. paniscus (see . An example of a site-specific behavior might be use of the middle level of the canopy (item 7): as suggested by Mittermeier (1978) , use of different canopy levels could represent behavioral plasticity in response to differences in forest structure among study sites rather than evolved species-specific traits.",

An example of a plausible observation in the first category is that small spider monkeys are taken by harpy eagles (item 19). Although harpy eagle (Harpia harpyja) predation on spider monkeys has not been reported in the scientific literature, harpy eagles are known to take howler monkeys (Peres, 1990; Sherman, 1991) and there is a report of a crested eagle (Morphnus guianensis) taking a young spider monkey (Julliot, 1994) . Another plausible observation of the first kind is that spider monkeys climb higher when they hear a tinamou fly (item 11). Although this also seems not to have been reported in the literature, notes that Guianan spider monkeys (A. paniscus) become upset by the flight of alarmed terrestrial animals (including tinamous), and climbing higher would be a prudent response to the arrival of an unseen predator. An example of a plausible observation in the second category is that spider monkeys are more common than woolly monkeys. Although we have not encountered any published study in which this has been reported (indeed, most reports suggest that Lagothrix is more common than Ateles where both taxa are present; e.g., , it is reasonable to assume that some aspect of the local flora or phenology might favor Ateles in the Yavar\u00ed-Ucayali interfluve. Examples of plausible observations in the third category include items 35 and 36, neither of which is addressed in the scientific literature, but which are consistent with inferences from spider monkey kills by other native Amazonian hunters (Shepard, 2002; da Silva et al., 2005) . A plausible observation of the fourth kind is the remark that spider monkeys suckle their young like people do (item 18), a simile that does not appear in the scientific literature, and one that we are unable to evaluate in the absence of any explicit, published description of nursing in Ateles.",

This behavior does not appear to have been reported in any published field study of spider monkeys. Indeed, at least one study suggests that a dominant female leads most foraging parties . Perhaps the Matses, who do not carry binoculars, are confused about the sex of leading animals, or they may assume that behavioral dominance in agonistic encounters between adult males and females implies a leadership role for males. A third possibility, of course, is that the Matses are correct, and that the local population of A. belzebuth differs in this respect from populations at other spider monkey research sites.",

Eat Chrysophyllum (Sapotaceae) fruit Corroborated (Carpenter, 1935; Klein and Klein, 1977; 84. Eat Manilkara (Sapotaceae) fruit Corroborated (Simmen and Sabatier, 1996; Mittermeier and Roosmalen, 1981; Soini, 1986; Terborgh, 1983; Rylands, 1987; Peres, 1993b) . Additionally, the Matses accurately describe many taxon-specific dietary features (described or referenced by the same authors), such as leaf consumption by Alouatta, geophagy by Alouatta and Ateles, vertebrate predation by both species of Cebus, ''bark'' (gum) consumption by Callithrix, and consumption of unripe fruits by Pithecia. However, Matses informants failed to mention several aspects of primate diets documented by scientific field studies. The Matses admit that they know little about the foods eaten by night monkeys, but other notable omissions from recorded monologs include arthropod consumption by Callithrix pygmaea (see Soini, 1988) and vertebrate predation by both local species of Saguinus (see . The general pattern apparent in these data is that Matses dietary observations are less complete for the smaller primates than they are for larger monkeys, but there are a few omissions even for the largest species. 16 Information gleaned from Matses monologs about community use of specific food plants (table 21) indicates that some fruits are eaten promiscuously, affording nourishment to many species of monkeys, whereas other fruits are eaten by just a few species. Fruits in the first category include some that are popular items in primate diets elsewhere in western Amazonia (Terborgh, 1983; Stevenson et al., 2000) , notably including several genera of Moraceae. However, other locally important food-plant taxa are rarely mentioned in the primate literature. The family Apocynaceae, for example, is seldom represented among lists of important primate fruits at other Amazonian localities, and the swamp palm (Mauritia flexuosa) has only been identified as an important food resource for primates at one other site in northeastern Peru (Aquino and Bodmer, 2004) . Some higher-taxonomic absences are also noteworthy. Among others, the families Annonaceae and Sapindaceae, both commonly eaten by primates in southeastern Peru (Terborgh, 1983) are not represented among the fruits positively identified as local monkey fodder by the Matses. Because there are noteworthy floristic, climatic, and edaphic differences between Matses hunting grounds in the Yavar\u00ed-Ucayali interfluve and Alouatta, Ateles, Lagothrix, Cebus, Saimiri, Saguinus, Cacajao, Callicebus, Pithecia Naucleopsis (2 spp.)",

Other interactions between the local primate fauna and particular plant taxa raise some interesting questions. Matses informants definitely assert that only howler monkeys eat the fruit of Apeiba aspera (Tiliaceae), but elsewhere in Amazonia the fruit of A. aspera is one of the preferred foods of capuchins and is strongly avoided by howlers (Stevenson et al., 2000) . Similarly, the Matses assert that only titi monkeys eat the fruit of the palm Euterpe precatoria (capuchins are said to eat just the unripe seeds), but the fruit of E. precatoria is eaten by spider monkeys at many other localities Castellanos and Chanin, 1996; Iwanaga and Ferrari, 2001; Wallace, 2006) . Whether such anomalies are attributable to intersite differences in environmental factors alleged to influence primate food preferences (Russo et al., 2005) or to observer error is unknown. Community patterns of habitat and substrate use reconstructed from Matses monologs (tables 22, 23) are generally consistent with the scientific literature. All of the atelids, for example, are accurately portrayed as using only the canopy of primary forest; howlers and squirrel monkeys are said to strongly prefer floodplain forest; Cebus apella and C. albifrons are said to prefer floodplain and upland forest respectively; titis are said to strongly prefer forest edges and secondary growth; the locally sympatric tamarins are said to differ in their preference for primary forest versus secondary growth; etc (Castro and Soini, 1977; Rylands, 1987; Peres, 1993c Peres, , 1997 Haugaasen and Peres, 2005; Parry et al., 2007) . Significantly, the Matses say that uakaris use both floodplain and upland forests, in agreement with recent field studies conducted within the Yavar\u00ed-Ucayali interfluve but in contrast with reports from other regions, where these monkeys are said to be flooded-forest specialists (Aquino, 1998; Heymann and Aquino, 2010) .",

Interestingly, the Matses observation that C. albifrons does not associate with Saimiri conflicts with the results of field studies in southern Peru (where Saimiri seems to associate with both C. apella and C. albifrons; Terborgh, 1983), but it is easier to reconcile with field studies from adjacent regions in northern Peru (where Saimiri associates much more frequently with C. apella than with C. albifrons; Soini, 1986) . Most of the other interspecific interactions reported by the Matses are unremarkable, but to our knowledge there has been only one previous report that Cebus apella kills and eats titi monkeys (Sampaio and Ferrari, 2005) . The lack of Matses observations about interactions involving Ateles and Alouatta is consistent with published generalizations that these genera rarely associate with other primates (Neville et al., 1988; Roosmalen and Klein, 1988) .

For example, one would expect the uakari monkey (Cacajao calvus) to have at least one or two synonyms given that the smaller and less important titi monkey (Callicebus cupreus) has three. Historical factors might explain anomalies like this if synonymy reflects long-term rather than current cultural importance.

Also, as noted by Fleck and Voss (2006) , there is a tendency for overdifferentiated species to be the same culturally important ones that receive multiple synonyms. Part of the explanation for this may be that hunters have frequent opportunities to inspect the physical details of killed game animals, and this personal experience allows them to detect subtle phenotypic differences among individuals or age cohorts that might be interpreted as analogous to the discontinuities that exist between closely related species. In fact, Matses hyponyms for saki monkeys (b\u00ebshudu and mamu) appear to be based on age-correlated variation in size and pelage traits rather than genetic differences (Fleck et al., 1999) . Information summarized in the preceding species accounts suggest that Matses hyponyms for other primates may also reflect ontogenetic or individual variation in size and pelage, but we cannot rule out two alternative explanations for some names: (1) the possibility, however remote, that additional primate taxa remain to be discovered in the Yavar\u00ed-Ucayali interfluve; or (2) that the Matses retain information in their lexicon about species previously encountered by the tribe before they settled in their current territory.",

In effect, hyponyms denote purported discontinuities between named varieties that some hunters may eventually find to be false.

One is that speaker disagreement about hyponyms for primates (and other taxa) usually involves species of intermediate cultural importance. Part of the reason for this is that small and/or culturally insignificant species are not overdifferentiated by anyone, perhaps because they are infrequently observed (e.g., Cebuella pygmaea) and seldom talked about. Large, culturally important species, on the other hand, are often seen and frequently discussed, so that hyponyms become widely known and accepted among hunters.",

The three exceptions among the primate examples are woolly and howler monkeys, each of which has three hyponyms, and the night monkey (Aotus), which has no superordinate term. As if motivated by such anomalies, we find interspeaker disagreement about the classification of these species. Nomenclature for folk ''genera'' with two local speciesb\u00ebchun (Cebus) and sipi (Saguinus)-follow this same pattern, suggesting that these biologically legitimate classifications may have been the model for the apparently superfluous practice of overdifferentiating game species. With respect to this labeling pattern, we note that sometimes the hyponyms are descriptive modifications of the superordinate term (e.g., achu \u00e7h\u00eb\u015fh\u00eb ''black howler monkey''), while in other cases one or two hyponyms will be monomorphemic.",

By contrast, the disputed ''archaic'' synonyms masoko (for the titi monkey, Callicebus cupreus) and chidu (for capuchin monkeys, Cebus spp.) are simply not recognized as legitimate by a subset of hunters who Abbreviations: 1uG 5 primary game (preferred, large); 2uG 5 secondary game (medium-sized); 3uG 5 tertiary game (small); 4uG 5 quaternary game (too small to merit adult attention); PT 5 partial dietary taboo; NE 5 not eaten. Ordering was determined by multiple interviews with Matses men and women as to which species are traditionally preferred based on size, taboo, tendency to have fat, and taste. claim they are a borrowing and a term used only in myths, respectively. Closer inspection reveals that all cases of disagreement about whether a hyponym exists at all as a legitimate term involve descriptive polymorphemic terms, whereas disagreements about whether a term is a hyponym or a synonym involve monomorphemic terms. The Matses are conscious of this linguistic distinction. When they argue about animal nomenclature, the nature of the term in question will be focused on. If a speaker is trying to discredit an overdifferentiated variety that is designated by a descriptive hyponym, he may say the term is simply an ad hoc expression that can be used to describe individuals in a variable but continuous species (the high phenotypic variability of domestic dogs is often mentioned as an example). Alternatively, when the hyponym in question is monomorphemic, the person discrediting the overdifferentiated category is unlikely to suggest discarding the term. Rather, he will typically suggest it is actually a synonym (as with saki monkeys) or less frequently, a borrowing (as with titi monkeys).",

Boldface identifies locality names as they appear in the text (alternative names or spellings are cited parenthetically). Except as noted otherwise, all localities are mapped in figures 1 and 2. September 1926). Hershkovitz (1977: 656, 928) placed this locality on the R\u00edo Mara\u00f1 \u00f3 n and claimed that the Olallas collected here, but he is incorrect on both counts. Marupa lies well below the confluence of the Mara\u00f1 \u00f3 n and the Ucayali, so it is unambiguously on the Amazon (R\u00edo Amazonas; for Peruvian fluvial nomenclature, see Faura-Gaig, 1964) . None of the Marupa skins we examined bear Olalla labels, nor are they prepared like Olalla-labelled skins from other localities. The Olallas' extensive correspondence with AMNH ornithologists and mammalogists (analyzed by Wiley, 2010) provides no evidence that they ever worked at this locality, and the dates associated with Marupa specimens are impossible to reconcile with the Olallas' known itineraries.
