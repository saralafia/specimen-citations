As a matter of fact, however, there are in North America a number of species of deer, and some of the species are made up of a number of subspecies or geographic races. Thus, deer for stocking secured from Oregon would represent a species different from the eastern white-tail, while those secured from Vermont, Colorado, and North Carolina would each be of a different subspecies.

I would therefore recommend caution, and before introducing mammals from other states I would advise a thorough study of the probable results by competent experts. Finally I would urge, if introductions are made, that complete records be kept of the subspecies brought in, of the source of origin, and the number of individuals introduced, and of the places of liberation. Through the kindness of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, we recently acquired a full-grown mature female monkey (Macacus, sive Pithecus, rhesus), which possesses a good-sized accessory nipple. It is the object of this paper to place the case on record and also to point out for the readers of this Journal the broader biological significance of polythelia and polymastia.",

In this condition they pointed somewhat laterad, whereas they are normally nearly parallel, with a slight droop when the animal is in the sitting position. In the former position the normal nipples were found to be attached 19 mm. from the",
