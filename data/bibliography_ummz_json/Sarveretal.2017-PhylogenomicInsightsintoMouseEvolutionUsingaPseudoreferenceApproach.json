    "abstract": "Comparative genomic studies are now possible across a broad range of evolutionary timescales, but the generation and analysis of genomic data across many different species still present a number of challenges. The most sophisticated genotyping and downstream analytical frameworks are still predominantly based on comparisons to high-quality reference genomes. However, established genomic resources are often limited within a given group of species, necessitating comparisons to divergent reference genomes that could restrict or bias comparisons across a phylogenetic sample. Here, we develop a scalable pseudoreference approach to iteratively incorporate sample-specific variation into a genome reference and reduce the effects of systematic mapping bias in downstream analyses. To characterize this framework, we used targeted capture to sequence whole exomes (~54 Mbp) in 12 lineages (ten species) of mice spanning the Mus radiation. We generated whole exome pseudoreferences for all species and show that this iterative reference-based approach improved basic genomic analyses that depend on mapping accuracy while preserving the associated annotations of the mouse reference genome. We then use these pseudoreferences to resolve evolutionary relationships among these lineages while accounting for phylogenetic discordance across the genome, contributing an important resource for comparative studies in the mouse system. We also describe patterns of genomic introgression among lineages and compare our results to previous studies. Our general approach can be applied to whole or partitioned genomic data and is easily portable to any system with sufficient genomic resources, providing a useful framework for phylogenomic studies in mice and other taxa.",

                "text": "The efficient generation and analysis of comparative genomewide data sets remains a key challenge in evolutionary biology. Massively parallel sequencing has made it relatively easy to generate whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data sets, enabling comparative genomic studies across a broad range of evolutionary timescales. However, the empirical and analytical resources required to generate comparative WGS data sets are still somewhat limiting in species groups with large, complex genomes. As a partial solution, various partitioning approaches are often used to generate comparative genome-wide data across broader sets of species (e.g., restriction site-associated DNA sequencing, targeted capture, transcriptomics, etc.; reviewed in Ekblom and Galindo 2011; Jones and Good 2016) . These approaches overcome the extra costs associated with WGS, but analyzing such data across a diverse sample of species still presents a number of challenges. In particular, the most sophisticated analytical frameworks often rely upon approaches developed for WGS and the numerous benefits afforded by a high quality reference genome (e.g., efficient genotyping, physical location, and associated functional annotation; Li and Durbin 2009; Li et al. 2009; McKenna et al. 2010; Yandell and Ence 2012) . Thus, as with WGS, the types of analyses that can be conducted using genome-wide partitioned data can be limited by the existence, quality, and completeness of a reference genome.",

                "text": "One common solution in species lacking genomic resources is to use an established reference from another species. Most genotyping approaches are reference-based at some level and thus depend on accurate sequence read mapping (DePristo et al. 2011) , which decreases with increasing sequence divergence from the reference (Li et al. 2008) . Although mapping algorithms allow for reference mismatches to account for some divergence, polymorphism, or sequencing error (Nielsen et al. 2011; Ruffalo et al. 2011; Liu et al. 2012) , mapping to a divergent reference can generate a number of systematic biases that could compromise comparative evolutionary analyses. For example, sequences that show substantial divergence from a reference will map with lower quality and effectively hide corresponding sample-specific variation. Analyses relying on full sequence information, such as those often used in phylogenetics or molecular evolution, may be particularly sensitive to these issues because called genotypes may converge towards the reference, resulting in an overestimated similarity between subject and reference sequences in divergent regions. This phenomenon, generally referred to as reference (or mapping) bias, has been discussed most frequently with regard to its effect on detecting allele-specific expression in transcriptomic analyses (e.g., Satya et al. 2012; Stevenson et al. 2013; Panousis et al. 2014; Brandt et al. 2015 ), yet it impacts any comparative study where reads are mapped to a divergent reference. For example, reference bias could lead to the underestimation of rates of molecular evolution or the overestimation of phylogenetic discordance due to stochastic genealogical processes (i.e., incomplete lineage sorting) or hybridization. One approach that has shown some promise in alleviating these concerns is the generation of \"pseudogenomes,\" or reference genomes that incorporate sample-specific variation (Holt et al. 2013; Huang et al. 2013 Huang et al. , 2014 . This allows annotation to be carried over from a reference while accounting for sequence divergence during the mapping stage. Here, we extend these previous works by developing a scalable pseudoreference approach to iteratively incorporate sample-specific variation into a reference and thereby reduce the effects of systematic mapping bias in downstream analyses.",

                "text": "The house mouse (Mus musculus) is an important model of mammalian biology and a compelling system in which to develop comparative genomic approaches and resources. In addition to extensive genetic and developmental resources, the mouse was the second mammal to be sequenced (Chinwalla et al. 2002) , and the mouse reference (C57BL/6, a mosaic lab strain primarily of M. musculus domesticus origin; Yang et al. 2011) remains second in quality only to the human genome. House mice have also emerged as a powerful system to address fundamental questions in genome evolution, population genetics, and speciation (e.g., Good et al. 2010; Halligan et al. 2010; Kousathanas et al. 2014; Turner et al. 2014; Phifer-Rixey and Nachman 2015; Larson et al. 2016) . Although most evolutionary genomic studies in this group have focused on a few closely related species and subspecies (e.g., Keane et al. 2011; Yang et al. 2011) , house mice are embedded within a radiation of~38 species that shared a common ancestor~7.5 Ma (Schenk et al. 2013) . Several of these species already have developed inbred laboratory strains, providing a unique combination of genetic and genomic resources that could be leveraged to address a wide array of evolutionary questions in mammals. However, aspects of the Mus phylogeny remain unresolved, including uncertainty in the evolutionary relationships among some key lineages that are relatively closely related to house mice (e.g., M. spretus/spicilegus/macedonicus and M. caroli/cookii/cervicolor; Hammer and Silver 1993; Lundrigan et al. 2002; Chevret et al. 2005; Tucker et al. 2005; Bryja et al. 2014) . In addition to uncertainty in overall species relationships, it is also unclear how much phylogenetic discordance there is across the house mouse genome due to incomplete lineage sorting or gene flow between species (e.g., Keane et al. 2011 . Resolving these outstanding issues is an important step in developing the mouse system for comparative evolutionary studies.",

Evol. 9(3):726-739. doi:10.1093/gbe/evx034 Advance Access publication February 22, 2017 February 28, 2017), which trims adapters and low-quality bases, merges overlapping reads, and removes identical reads (putative PCR duplicates). Initial capture performance statistics were calculated using CollectHsMetrics in Picard v2.5.0 (available from http://github.com/broadinstitute/ picard; last accessed February 28, 2017). To mitigate reference bias, we employed an iterative mapping strategy to generate species-specific exomes embedded within the mouse reference genome (GRCm38). Cleaned reads were mapped to the reference genome using the MEM algorithm of BWA v0.7.15 (Li and Durbin 2009; Li 2013) . Duplicate reads were identified postmapping using Picard v2.5.0. For multiply mapped reads, only the location with the best mapping quality was included in the analysis. Regions with insertions or deletions (indels) were identified and realigned, and single nucleotide variants (SNVs) were called using HaplotypeCaller within the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) v3.6 (McKenna et al. 2010; DePristo et al. 2011) . Resulting SNVs were filtered for a minimum quality of 30 and a minimum sequencing depth of at least five independent reads. These variants were injected back into the original reference using FastaAlternateReferenceMaker within the GATK. Additional processing of files, such as indexing, merging, and sorting, was accomplished using SAMtools v1.3.1 (Li et al. 2009) and Picard v2.5.0, as required. After each round, the modified reference was used as the starting point for additional iterations, starting with remapping of all reads and proceeding through variant calling. The early rounds of this iterative procedure should systematically introduce variants from the sample into the reference, increasing the number of sample reads that map and the number of variants that can be confidently called until the number of incorporated reads stabilizes across subsequent iterations. At this point, we inserted IUPAC ambiguity codes at putative heterozygous positions.",

Preliminary evaluation (data not shown) suggested more than three iterations of mapping and genotyping would be required to incorporate most variation into a pseudoreference. We examined this empirically by identifying the number of iterations (5) at which read incorporation and per-site sequence divergence plateaued in the most divergent species in our sample, M. pahari. We then used this as the number of iterations necessary to produce a stable pseudoreference across all species in our sample. As a final step, each position with insufficient data to confidently call a sample genotype was excluded; an additional round of variant calling was performed with the EMIT_ALL_SITES argument set, producing a VCF with calls at each position. All remaining ambiguous positions (genotype quality <30, read depth <10 or >60) were hard masked (i.e., replaced with an \"N\") using GNU awk and bedtools v2.25 (Quinlan and Hall 2010) . This produced a final consensus pseudoreference exome for each sample with the same coordinate system as the mouse reference. We also generated pseudoreferences without ambiguity codes for some downstream analyses. These are useful for bioinformatic analyses, including mapping and variant calling, which assume a haploid reference. All code necessary to replicate these procedures starting from cleaned reads is available as part of the pseudo-it project on GitHub (http://www.github.com/bricesarver/pseudo-it; last accessed February 28, 2017), and all pseudoreferences are available upon request.",

First, we estimated the overall phylogeny from a concatenated alignment of gene sequences using the brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) as an outgroup. For each targeted protein-coding gene, we extracted the longest protein-coding transcript sequence based on the UCSC genes track (retrieved through the UCSC Genome Browser) from each iterated pseudoreference and from the whole genome reference sequence for M. m. domesticus strain C57BL/6. For each species, exons were extracted and assembled into transcripts using custom code and the Biostrings package (Pag\u00e8 s et al. 2016) in R v3.1.3 (R Core Team 2015) and then combined into a multispecies alignment. We then used BioMart (Smedley et al. 2015) to identify one-to-one orthologous transcripts in R. norvegicus. Each set of transcripts was translation aligned using TranslatorX (Abascal et al. 2010) with the Muscle progressive alignment algorithm (Edgar 2004) . Alignments without a length evenly divisible by three or possessing internal stop codons were discarded (5702 genes). With this filtered gene set, we then performed concatenated analyses by chromosome to simplify data processing and to verify internal consistency of analyses. All transcript sets from each chromosome were combined into a supermatrix using Phyutility v2.2.6 (Smith and Dunn 2008) . A tree was estimated for each chromosome with the MPI version of RAxML v8.2.3 (Stamatakis et al. 2005; Stamatakis 2014 ) using a simultaneous maximum likelihood (ML) search and rapid bootstrapping run under the GTR + \u00c0 model of sequence evolution (autoMRE option). Trees were visualized using FigTree v1.4.2 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree; last accessed February 28, 2017). Among-chromosome topological discordance was assessed by rooting trees with rat and estimating pairwise Robinson-Foulds distances (Robinson and Foulds 1981) using the ape library (Paradis et al. 2004) ",

However, the speciation process is not necessarily instantaneous and we expect some regions of the genome to show conflicting phylogenetic histories due to incomplete lineage sorting, hybridization, or undetected gene duplication. In phylogenetics, a distinction is made between the history of a locus (a \"gene tree\") and the true relationship among lineages (a \"species tree\"; Maddison 1997). Several approaches have been developed to account for gene treespecies tree discordance under the multispecies coalescent (e.g., Edwards et al. 2007; Liu et al. 2009; Heled and Drummond 2010 ), yet many of these approaches are computationally intensive and thus less practical for genome-scale data sets. With these limitations in mind, we accounted for phylogenetic discordance in our data set using the computationally efficient species tree algorithm implemented in ASTRAL v4.10.11 (Mirarab et al. 2014; Sayyari and Mirarab 2016) . Assuming sets of independent and accurately estimated gene trees, ASTRAL breaks each tree into its constituent quartets (i.e., four-taxa cases) and recovers a consistent estimate of the species tree.",

To increase local phylogenetic signals, we expanded our working data set to include 5'-or 3' untranslated regions (UTR) and all other regions targeted for capture. Though exome probes are usually contained within annotated exons, both the capture process itself and the iterative pseudoreference process allow for the discovery of variation in flanking regions. To incorporate this variation, we extended each target by 200 bp on both ends and merged regions that were up to 1 kbp apart, increasing the total data set from 54.3 to 163.4 Mbp. As above, we first used RAxML (GTR + \u00c0, 200 bootstrap replicates) to estimate an ML tree per chromosome by extracting extended targets using bedtools v2.2.5 and combining regions with AMAS (Borowiec 2016) . For these data, no alignment is required because indel variation is not incorporated into the pseudoreference. We then repeated this procedure across autosomal windows of five different sizes (extended targets, 100 kbp, 500 kbp, 1 Mbp, and 5 Mbp), estimating ML phylogenies from each window using the fast hill-climbing algorithm in RAxML. Strong linkage disequilibrium typically extends 100 kbp or less within wild house mouse (M. musculus) populations (Laurie et al. 2007 ), suggesting that larger window sizes may combine regions with independent phylogenetic histories. Any window containing only missing data for at least one individual was discarded. For each window size, all trees were combined for species tree inference in ASTRAL. We also calculated among-locus phylogenetic discordance using the normalized quartet score, which quantifies the amount of quartet discordance relative to the species tree.",

We used the D-statistic (i.e., Patterson's D or the ABBA-BABA test) to characterize patterns among species (Green et al. 2010; Durand et al. 2011) . Briefly, the D-statistic is a normalized difference of counts of two site patterns within a rooted four-taxa case: ABBA and BABA. ABBA counts indicate a sharing of alleles between the first taxon and a specified outgroup (A) and the second and third taxa (B), whereas the opposite is true for the BABA case. Significance was assessed using a chi-square test (see Pease and Hahn 2015) , and 95% confidence intervals estimated using a nonparametric bootstrap with 10,000 replicates. Additionally, when our sampling allowed, we estimated the minimum proportion of genomic admixture (f ) following Durand et al. (2011) . The D-statistic is relatively robust to genotying error (Green et al. 2010; Durand et al. 2011 ), but could be sensitive to inherent differences in the source and quality of the exome data relative to the reference genome (dom C57BL/6 ). Therefore, we limited our comparisons to sequenced exomes except when directly testing for differential introgression between M. m. musculus and the two available M. m. domesticus genotypes (dom LEWES , dom C57BL/6 ).",

Increases in per-site divergence were lowest for M. m. domesticus (dom LEWES , 0.19% vs. 0.22%; fig. 1A) , and highest for the most distantly related lineage in our study, M. pahari (3.34% vs. 4.24%). In all cases, the most dramatic change was observed after mapping to the first estimated pseudoreference (i.e., iteration 2) and appeared to reach an asymptote by the fourth iteration. However, the relative magnitude of change scaled with divergence ( fig. 1B) , assuming that incremental increases reflect divergence estimates asymptotically approaching their true value. These results indicate that the number of iterations required to mitigate biases will be contingent on the divergence levels between sample(s) and reference(s) in a given study.",

Although the number of confidently called sites decreased with divergence from the mouse reference genome, the total number of confidently called sites relative to the first iteration increased (table 2) . Intuitively, we would also expect that genotype qualities should tend to increase in the context of pseudoreferences. Consistent with this, we observed a positive skew in genotype qualities for all three species at positions that were confidently called relative to the mouse reference genome and the final pseudoreference ( fig.  2 ). However, we also observed many sites where the genotype quality decreased, frequently reflecting the loss of reads at a position due to being more confidently placed elsewhere after iteration. We also observe cases where sites called as homozygous reference or alternative relative to the mouse reference are called heterozygous (and vice versa) due to the placement of reads with alternate alleles at a given site.",

We then used these trees to estimate species trees while accounting for among-locus topological discordance. We detected no appreciable discordance in the point-estimate of the species tree (rooted on M. pahari; fig. 3 ) when compared with the perchromosome concatenated trees at the 100 kbp, 500 kbp, 1 Mbp, and 5 Mbp scales ( fig. 4 ). However, quartet support for some branches did vary by window size, and there was discordance at the target-level scale (fig. 4 ). The lowest support was found for branches defining the M. pahari-platythrix-minutoides group at the base of the tree, suggesting some uncertainty in the placement of these deep nodes. Indeed, M. platythrix and M. pahari share a common ancestor in the species tree estimated using the extended targets, contrary to all other analyses. Only 36% of quartets support this clade, and the branch is extremely short. We also observed some variation in support levels within other groups. For example, although the M. spretus-spicilegus-macedonicus clade itself was well supported across most analyses, only 43% of quartets support the species tree designation of this clade at the level of targets ( fig. 4) . Support steadily increased to 59% at the 100 kbp scale, 74% at the 500 kbp scale, 82% at the 1 Mbp scale, and 96% at the 5 Mbp scale. Thus, there is some fine-scale discordance in this group of interest, but the overall species tree generally shows more support than alternative phylogenies. Likewise, support for the M. caroli-cookii-cervicolor started at 60% at the target scale and reached 100% at the 5 Mbp scale. Normalized quartet scores suggest~80% of all quartets support the species tree at the target scale, and this increased to~99% at the 5 Mbp scale. Considering all analyses, the phylogeny for these taxa appears reasonably well resolved with relatively low levels of topological discordance, at least at the scales that can be reasonably evaluated with our exome data.",

Additionally, we describe the first targeted sequencing effort of complete exomes for approximately one-third of described Mus species diversity. Using these data, we resolve the phylogenetic relationships between these mouse species and describe patterns of introgression among lineages. Our analyses demonstrate that targeted exome sequencing is useful for both of these tasks and provides a proof-of-concept for similar analyses in other systems. More generally, our pseudoreference framework alleviates mapping biases that can lead to systematic underestimates in divergence and related statistics, providing a useful tool for comparative genomic analyses.

Even among closely related species, we demonstrated that reference bias can have a strong impact on estimation of basic parameters, such as genetic divergence ( fig. 1 ) and genotype quality ( fig. 2) . These simple comparisons illustrate that while reference-based genotyping is sensitive to divergence, the iterative pseudoreference approach reduces these biases over moderate levels of sequence divergence. Pseudoreferences, therefore, should generally increase the quality of and confidence in downstream analyses through incorporating additional reads and placing them with greater confidence. Implementation of our approach is straightforward (with the pseudo-it package), requires the same set of resources as standard mapping and variant calling, and preserves the coordinate system of the original reference. An alternative approach would be to de novo assemble targeted regions within each species (e.g., Bi et al. 2012) . Whereas mapping to contigs assembled de novo is not expected to introduce reference bias, assembly requires substantially more computational power and results in a new coordinate system that needs to be linked between species. Any hard-earned empirical or computational annotation afforded by a reference would also need to be reestablished.",

Recent studies using restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) have shown that overall data quality is considerably higher when using a reference (Fountain et al. 2016; Shafer et al. 2016 ). Mapping of reads followed by de novo assembly would also be expected to reduce mapping bias and genotyping errors but consumes substantially more resources (Gan et al. 2011; Hunter et al. 2015) . It is possible to obtain genomic coordinates of contig sets assembled de novo by aligning to a reference. However, such an approach is computationally demanding. For example, de Bruijn graph-based assembly would need to be performed under a range of k-mer values and clustered, and each assembly is both CPU and memory intensive. Furthermore, de novo assemblies from transcriptomic or capture data sets are often highly fragmented (e.g., Bi et al. 2012) , leading to additional complications. We have shown that studies lacking species-specific references may benefit from an iterative approach, provided that a reference genome exists within a moderate evolutionary distance.",

In addition to exonic sequences, noncoding (e.g., introns and intergenic regions) may also be targeted for capture or recovered through anonymous partitioning approaches. Given that they tend to evolve more quickly than exons ( fig. 1C ), these noncoding regions would aid in resolving relationships among closely related taxa, inferring rates of evolution in concert with the phylogeny, or investigating finer-scale patterns of phylogenetic discordance.

For example, we did not take indel variation into account when iterating our pseudoreferences in order to maintain a consistent coordinate system across many species. Due to the deleterious effect of frameshift mutations, indels tend to be rare in protein coding regions and we chose to ignore them within our study. Others have incorporated indel information within pseudogenomes (Holt et al. 2013; Huang et al. 2013 Huang et al. , 2014 , though these studies were focused on pairwise contrasts between very closely related genomes and did not use iteration. Extending the pseudoreference approach to efficiently incorporate small-scale indels across a phylogenetic sample remains an important goal for future studies; however, this reference-based framework will always be limiting with respect to larger-scale structural variation (e.g., chromosomal translocations and inversions). Thus, the approach outlined here will be most useful for generating comparative evolutionary genomic data sets of orthologous loci that can be used for phylogenetic and population genomic inferences. The relevance of such reference-based comparative studies should continue to grow as high quality reference genomes become increasingly common across the tree of life.",

In particular, the relationships between M. spretus/spicilegus/macedonicus and M. caroli/cookii/cervicolor have remained unclear (e.g., Lundrigan et al. 2002; Tucker et al. 2005; Tucker 2008 ). For example, there was conflicting evidence about the relationships among M. spretus, M. spicilegus, and M. macedonicus and the placement of each relative to the M. musculus species group. Our analyses resolved this group as monophyletic as well as the phylogenetic relationships among all ten species ( fig. 3 ). Though discordance among M. spretus, M. spicilegus, and M. macedonicus is appreciable at the scale of extended targets, a majority of quartets still support the species relationships inferred from all other data sets ( fig. 4) . Overall, the species phylogeny is relatively well supported even when accounting for among-locus phylogenetic discordance ( fig. 4 ). This information is crucial for effectively designing genomic or functional genetic experiments in house mice that require comparisons to closely related species. Moreover, we note that the phylogenetic relationships that we recovered were robust across individual genealogies estimated at different local scales ( fig. 4 ) and when considering targets from smaller subsets of the whole exome capture (e.g., by chromosome). However, in one case, using extended targets alone for species tree analysis transposed the relationships at the base of the tree on a short branch with low quartet support, presumably reflecting a lack of informative sites in the alignments. These patterns suggest that the same general phylogenetic conclusions would have been apparent using a much smaller set of targeted loci as long as enough phylogenetically informative sites are present to confidently resolve relationships.",

                "text": "We also detected introgression between some mouse lineages. These results were not unexpected and are in strong agreement with other studies investigating whole-genome ancestry among mouse strains. Classic inbred strains derive from early breeding efforts of mouse fanciers (Beck et al. 2000) , which included some crosses between species and subspecies (Ferris et al. 1982; Tucker et al. 1992; Ideraabdullah et al. 2004) . The mosaic nature of classic inbred strains of mice is well known (Bonhomme et al. 1987; Yalcin et al. 2010; Didion and Pardo-Manuel De Villena 2013) , but the extent of introgression has been the subject of some debate. Using a genome-wide SNP genotyping platform, Yang et al. (2011) estimated that M. m. domesticus strain C57BL/6 has a genome composed of~93% M. m. domesticus, and~7% M. m. musculus. Our estimate of 6.8% is in close agreement with their inferences, indicating that levels of introgression within sequenced genic regions is similar to genome-wide patterns based on SNVs and that variable ascertainment schemes used to populate the Mouse Diversity Genotyping Array (Yang et al. 2009) do not appear to bias overall signatures of gene flow. Additionally, we detected a strong signature of M. m. domesticus introgression into the wild-derived M. m. musculus strain PWK/PhJ, consistent with Yang et al. (2011) (fig. 5 , supplementary material table S3, Supplementary Material online). The context of introgression involving this and some other wild-derived strains remains unclear. For PWK/PhJ, this could reflect natural gene flow as this strain was derived from the Czech Republic near the natural hybrid zone between M. m. domesticus and M. m. musculus. However, it has also been suggested that the haplotype structures of introgressed regions in this and a few other wildderived inbred stains are consistent with very recent gene flow, perhaps occurring in the laboratory subsequent to strain derivation (Yang et al. 2011) . Liu et al. (2015) found 0.02-0.8% M. spretus ancestry within M. m. domesticus, and other studies have described natural introgression between these taxa (Orth et al. 2002; Keane et al. 2011; Song et al. 2011) . We did not detect appreciable introgression between M. m. domesticus (dom LEWES ) and M. spretus, suggesting that the extent of introgression between these species is variable among individuals.",

However, we did detect introgression between M. cookii and M. caroli. These species are broadly distributed throughout Eastern and Southeastern Asia and can cooccur in the same localities along with M. cervicolor (Suzuki and Aplin 2012) . Introgression between these lineages, therefore, is not unexpected. Interestingly, these findings further support the notion that association with humans may contribute to hybridization between Mus species. Evidence for natural introgression within Mus includes cases of secondary contact following human-associated range expansions of M. spretus and M. musculus and between various M. musculus lineages (Palomo et al. 2009; Jones et al. 2010; Gabriel et al. 2010; Bonhomme et al. 2011; Song et al. 2011; Suzuki et al. 2013) . Additionally, while the historical relationships of M. cookii and M. caroli and humans are less clear, both species (along with M. cervicolor) primarily occur in rice fields and nearby areas (Suzuki and Aplin 2012) . This suggests that contact between lineages, and subsequent hybridization, may have been facilitated by agricultural development. Collectively, our results suggest that exome capture approaches may provide a powerful tool to reliably investigate finer-scale patterns of introgression among Mus species.",
