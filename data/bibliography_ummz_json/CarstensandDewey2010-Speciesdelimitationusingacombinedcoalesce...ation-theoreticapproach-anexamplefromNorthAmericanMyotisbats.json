In order to identify these processes, biologists must first recognize and delimit nascent evolutionary lineages (Sites and Marshall 2004; Wiens 2007) . Genetic data at the interface between populations and species are generally useful for delimitation efforts, particularly gene trees from neutral loci (Harrison 1998; Templeton 2001 ). Because the pattern of allele coalescence is stochastic and can be defined in a probabilistic manner (Tajima 1983; Takahata and Nei 1985; Hudson et al. 1987) , the rate that ancestral polymorphism is lost in a given lineage provides valuable information concerning both temporal divergence between sister lineages and the branching pattern of the phylogeny. Gene trees can be employed in delimitation efforts in 2 ways. For single-locus data, qualitative assessments of lineage boundaries can be derived from the genealogy estimate (Pellegrino et al. 2005) . However, because any particular gene tree may not reflect the actual pattern of lineage splitting and divergence, this approach can be misled by coalescent stochasticity (Hudson and Coyne 2002) . Data from multiple unlinked loci can mitigate the effects of the randomness inherent to genetic drift, and the acquisition of these data has led to a dramatic shift in how the phylogenies of recently diverged clades are estimated.",

These theoretical and practical difficulties with concatenation have spurred the incorporation of coalescent models into phylogenetic methods, a development that has been described as one of the most exciting recent developments in systematics (Page and Sullivan 2008; Edwards 2009) . Phylogenetic inference near the species level necessarily incorporates aspects of population genetic theory and methodology because the genetic forces acting within a population, such as genetic drift, selection, and migration, may each play an important role in speciation (Maddison and Knowles 2006) . Several recently introduced phylogenetic methods operate under the assumption that genetic drift has produced the incongruence between gene trees and species trees (Maddison W.P. and Maddison D.R. 2004; Degnan and Salter 2005; An\u00e9 et al. 2007; Edwards et al. 2007; Liu and Pearl 2007; Oliver 2008; . Relative to the delimitation of evolutionary lineages, the most important difference between these approaches and conventional methods of phylogenetic inference is the shift in the operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Rather than using a single or several representative individuals as exemplars, the species or population lineages are used as the OTUs and multiple alleles are sampled within each lineage. Thus, in addition to incorporating coalescent models of population processes in phylogenetic inference, methods of species tree estimation also model the membership of individuals to evolutionary lineages. This novel approach enables the relationships among these lineages to be inferred directly and also allows the membership of individual samples in these lineages to 2010 CARSTENS AND DEWEY-SPECIES DELIMITATION IN MYOTIS BATS 401 be explored directly. outlined the first approach to conduct lineage delimitation using a method for species tree inference:",

Rather than equating gene trees with a species tree or basing species status on some genetic threshold, the relationship between the gene trees and the lineage history is modeled probabilistically using coalescent theory (Hudson 1991) . Adopting this explicit model-based approach also avoids problems with species delimitation that result when genetic thresholds are applied to genetic data-the detection biases arising from the timing and method of speciation and failure of any threshold to take into account the stochastic variance associated with genetic processes. However, the Knowles-Carstens approach has practical shortcomings, some of which are related to its use of the program COAL in an application not intended by Degnan and Salter (2005) . Since its publication, additional methods for estimating species phylogeny have been developed, and at least 2 of these (Bayesian estimation of species trees [BEST], species tree estimation using maximum likelihood [STEM]) exhibit considerable potential for the delimitation of evolutionary lineages. Here, we use these programs to explore lineage boundaries in 10 described subspecies from the Myotis lucifugus/western long-eared Myotis clade.",

                "text": "Background Information North American Myotis Molecular sequence data from mitochondrial genes are inconsistent with described species boundaries in the M. lucifugus/western long-eared Myotis clade of North American bats. Although this clade is consistently monophyletic in broadscale analyses of Myotis phylogeny (Ruedi and Mayer 2001; Stadelmann et al. 2007) , relationships within it are difficult to infer. For example, the genealogy from cytochrome b suggests that M. lucifugus, M. thysanodes, and M. evotis are each paraphyletic (Dewey 2006) . Results of phylogeographic analyses within this lineage are consistent with similar investigations from other animals, which demonstrate that there can be dramatic incon-gruence between recognized species boundaries and clades contained within the genealogies of particular genetic loci (Riddle et al. 2000; Shaw 2000; Funk and Omland 2003) . When confronted with paraphyly at mitochondrial DNA loci, researchers have been conditioned to gather sequence data from additional nuclear loci (Brumfield et al. 2003) , but to date it is unclear how researchers can best use these data to assess species limits.",

Introns were targeted because we hoped to identify loci with a sufficient number of variable sites to estimate gene trees with high confidence. Thirty-six primer pairs were tried, 17 amplified across the screening set. Of these 14 sequenced well and 12 appeared to be single copy after polymerase chain reaction (PCR) subcloning.

STEM can produce an analytically derived ML species tree with branch lengths that is similar to the GLASS tree (Mossel and Vigoda 2005) when \u03b8 is equal across branches and is a consistent estimator of the species tree when the gene trees are estimated without error . Thus, if the ML estimate of the species tree is the primary goal of an analysis, then the only uncertainty that must be considered by the researcher is the phylogenetic error associated with gene tree estimation. STEM assumes that the gene trees are sampled from loci that are evolving in a clocklike manner because the analytical calculations in STEM are based on estimation of species divergence time. Consequently, we conducted STEM analyses using 1) only those loci that did not violate the molecular clock and 2) all loci, with branch length optimization constrained to be clocklike, which may be a reasonable option for non-clocklike data. Sequence data from cytochrome b was scaled in STEM analyses to reflect the difference in N e between mitochondrial and autosomal loci. We omitted data from locus 681a in the STEM analyses because we were unable to amplify this locus in M. volans.",

The likelihood of all hierarchical permutations of these lineages was calculated such that we evaluated every combination of subspecies within any species and compared these combinations with those within the other species. There are 150 such combinations: the product of 15 permutations of the 4 subspecies within M. lucifugus (e.g., all subspecies treated as separate lineages, all subspecies combined into one lineage, 6 combinations of 3 lineages, and 7 combinations of 2 lineages), 5 permutations of the 3 subspecies within M. thysanodes, and 2 permutations of the 2 subspecies within M. evotis. Note that although we limited the permutations of lineage membership to those within described species, we did nothing to constrain the species phylogeny (e.g., paraphyletic species were allowed). Likelihoods were evaluated using LRTs following for each of the above subspecies. Because this test uses estimates of topology and branch lengths of the species tree but assumes that estimated gene trees reflect the actual history of allelic coalescence, we also explored the degree to which uncertainty in the gene tree estimates complicates delimitation efforts. To accomplish this, we assessed lineage distinctiveness using BEST by computing the Bayes factor (Kass and Raftery 1995) between the posterior distributions of a BEST analysis where 2 lineages are separated and one where they are collapsed. This approach considers both the topology and the branch lengths of species trees, the properties most relevant to the general hypothesis outlined above, and accounts for uncertainty inherent to the estimation of gene trees. It is also conducted in a statistical framework that determines whether species trees with separate or collapsed lineages best fit the data. However, computing Bayes factors for all above comparisons would require 151 BEST runs, a computational commitment beyond our resources. As a result, these tests were conducted on selected lineages.",

As with earlier approaches, the assumptions of models are likely to be critical to the performance of these methods. For example, certain types of gene flow can degrade the accuracy of species tree estimates (Eckert and Carstens 2008) , and species tree estimates improve when more individuals are sampled within lineages (McCormack et al. 2009) . One assumption of species tree methods that has not been explored is the effect of incorrect assignment of samples to the aggregates that serve as the OTUs; this could lead to inaccurate estimation of the topology, species divergence times, or both. We conducted a small simulation analysis to explore this question. Genealogies were simulated with ms (Hudson 2002) under 2 species trees. In the first, 5 lineages were separated by branch lengths sufficient to allow for sorting of ancestral polymorphism (Fig. 1a) . The second phylogeny differed only in a division in one terminal branch, resulting in 6 lineages, that is sufficiently short to prevent lineage sorting (Fig. 1b) .",

We report results using the value of \u03b8 estimated from subspecies because the model that treats subspecies as OTUs has a better likelihood given the data than the model that treats species as OTUs, regardless of the \u03b8 used. Species tree estimates (using STEM) were made using loci that were consistent with the molecular clock, as well as with all 6 loci. The species phylogeny ( Fig. 2a) suggests that M. keenii is the basal member of the M. lucifugus and the western long-eared Myotis clade, that M. thysanodes is the next most basal lineage, and that M. lucifugus and M. evotis are sister taxa. As in the Mesquite MDC analysis, using described subspecies as OTUs changes the phylogeny estimate (Fig. 2b) . Although the overall structure of the topology is similar to that where species are used as OTUs, both M. evotis and M. lucifugus are paraphyletic. Additionally, the overall depth of the topology is less when subspecies are used as OTUs. The topology is constant when the species tree is estimated using all loci (e.g., including the 3 that violate the molecular clock), but the timing of speciation is compressed toward the present (Fig. 2c) .

Several methods were used to assess stationarity of Markov chains.

We first compared a model where each described subspecies within a given species was independent with models that collapse some combination of these subspecies into lineages. For these tests, which were conducted using samples across all subspecies, we chose models with the highest overall likelihood (e.g., no constraints were placed on lineage composition in other species) and then used LRTs to assess statistical significance after correcting for multiple comparisons with a Bonferroni correction. For both M. lucifugus and M. evotis, collapsing subspecies into lineages results in a significant decrease in the likelihood of the model given the data (Table 4 ), suggesting that many of the described subspecies within these species are independent evolutionary lineages. Conversely, results suggest that M. thysanodes is composed of a single evolutionary lineage. Bayes factors were computed for some comparisons by comparing the output of several BEST runs (Table 5 ). When the model that treated described subspecies as lineages was compared with the model that treated species as lineages, the Bayes factors favored the former. Similarly, this approach favored models where 2 of the 3 subspecies within M. thysanodes were collapsed into a single lineage but not the model where all 3 subspecies were collapsed. In all cases, relative support for the preferred model was not strong.",

Clearly, users of STEM should favor splitting to lumping when the boundaries of the lineages are in question because false lumping appears to have important consequences to phylogeny estimation, whereas false splitting does not. DISCUSSION Systematic investigations that use genetic data to evaluate existing taxonomic descriptions are often complicated by findings of poly-or paraphyly in described species (Funk and Omland 2003) . Although many recent investigations have documented cases of appreciable intraspecific genetic divergence (Hendrixson and Bond 2004; Olson et al. 2004; Camargo et al. 2006; Kozak et al. 2006; Starrett and Hedin 2007) , it is not yet clear how best to use molecular data to test existing taxonomic designations. One approach, which we have adopted here, proceeds by evaluating models of lineage composition under a phylogenetic framework that implements a coalescent model. Because population-level processes such as the loss of ancestral polymorphism due to genetic drift are ubiquitous at the initial stages of diversification, we suspect that accurate estimates of phylogeny at the shallowest levels of divergence will require phylogenetic methods that incorporate coalescent models. Although acceptance of these models is growing among systematists (Edwards 2009) , it is not commonly appreciated that the application of methods such as MDC, STEM, and BEST requires an active consideration of the boundaries of lineages because the underlying coalescent models assume that each OTU consists of a single metapopulation lineage. Here, we make the first attempt to test models of lineage composition in a complex empirical system using a probabilistic framework.",

In M. evotis, where individuals from 2 subspecies were sampled, this approach required a single comparison, and the LRT suggests that we can reject the model where these subspecies constitute a single lineage. However, in species where there are more than 2 subspecies (here M. thysanodes and M. lucifugus), models representing all combinations of lineage composition must be compared. Although our results were internally consistent in that we do not identify a subspecies as independent in one comparison and nonindependent in another, such results are possible. Therefore, we developed a second approach to delimitation that proceeds by exhaustively calculating the probability of hierarchical combinations of lineage composition, computing AIC scores for each, and calculating the relative likelihood of the models given the data. Information-theoretic results provide both an absolute ranking of the models and an evaluation of the relative statistical support of the best models and are thus easier to interpret in complex systems such as M. lucifugus and the western long-eared Myotis. For example, in our Myotis data, we find that models treating the majority of described subspecies as evolutionary lineages have the highest likelihood, regardless of methodological details such as the assumed value of \u03b8 or the inclusion of loci that violate the molecular clock.",

Because the AIC difference (\u0394 i ) is a measure of the difference in Kullback-Leibler divergence between the models, these metrics essentially represent how much information is lost when model i is used to represent reality rather than the best model. In the case of our Myotis data, a substantial amount of information loss occurs when evolutionary lineages (here subspecies) are lumped without biological justification. For example, the \u0394 i between the best model and the model where described species are treated as independently evolving lineages is >180 AIC units, suggesting that the model consistent with the existing taxonomy is extremely poor. Model probabilities provide another way to assess the relative merits of a set of models; here, the 6 best models (which all treat subspecies within M. lucifugus and M. evotis as independent) account for over 99% of the total model probabilities.

Qualitatively, adding these loci compresses the temporal divergence toward the present (Fig. 2c) , a behavior that is expected for a method (STEM) that is based on divergence time estimation. It is interesting to note that BEST includes method for converting nonultrametric gene trees (which are proposed during the Markov chain Monte Carlo [MCMC] search of gene tree space) into ultrametric gene trees used to calculate the posterior density of gene trees given the species tree. To date, the effects of this approximation have not been evaluated (Rannala and Yang 2008) , and in general these sorts of evaluations are computationally difficult in programs such as BEST that implement MCMC methods. However, when we conducted BEST runs using all loci, we observed a compression of the temporal divergence toward the present that was qualitatively similar to the behavior exhibited by STEM (cf. Figs. 2c-3b ). Obviously, these comparisons are difficult to make because clocklike loci are a subset of the total. We also observed that the species phylogeny estimated from all loci differs from one estimated from a subset of the loci in the BEST analysis. STEM and BEST complement one another in 2 important ways. STEM assumes that gene trees are estimated without error, an assumption that is almost certainly violated for empirical systems. BEST uses separate Markov chains to estimate the gene trees and the species phylogeny. Consequently, the posterior density of species tree space is integrated over the uncertainty in gene tree space. However, Markov chains are computationally intensive to a degree that makes detailed exploration via simulation difficult (but see Liu et al. 2008) . STEM is computationally inexpensive by comparison, which allows for exploration of factors related to lineage delimitation such as the number and composition of lineages. These contrasts suggest to us that neither of these programs is likely to be as effective independently as they are when they are used concurrently.",

Example results from simulation exploration of species delimitation using STEM. a) Shows the average of species tree estimates made using 10 loci with 6 lineages as OTUs (phylogeny with thick lines) and the effects of falsely lumping 2 lineages together. b) Shows the effects of falsely splitting a single lineage. In all cases, the topology is consistent, and the species tree estimated using the correct assignment of individuals to lineages is essentially identical to that used for the simulations. Shaded boxes represent the 95% confidence interval of branch length for the species tree estimates. gene trees are estimated without error because phylogenetic error in gene tree estimation is associated with a lack of resolution in the species tree estimates (Huang and Knowles 2009) . Nodal support values for each estimated gene tree ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ) are relatively high, which indicate to us that our gene tree estimates are relatively accurate and moreover provide us with confidence that the evolutionary lineages that we have delimited within the M. lucifugus/western long-eared Myotis clade reflect actual evolutionary units. But we cannot be certain that our estimates of the genealogies are accurate, this is a shortcoming inherent to all approaches that estimate species trees from gene trees. The other significant concern is the assumption that the shared polymorphism is entirely the result of the incomplete sorting of ancestral polymorphism. We explored this concern by estimating gene flow, under the assumption that it was the other likely source for shared polymorphism in this system. Two dramatically different coalescent methods were used, and this exploration highlights both the difficulties and the possibilities of working at the interface between phylogenetics and population genetics.",

Gene flow can decrease the accuracy of species tree estimates under some conditions (Eckert and Carstens 2008) and it is reasonable to expect that it could do the same for delimitation. However, just as estimates of species phylogeny may be complicated by gene flow, estimating gene flow in empirical systems can be complicated by the divergence among populations (Wakeley 2000) . Generally, there are 2 approaches that one can take when designing a coalescent-based method to estimate gene flow. If one assumes an equilibrium model, gene flow can be estimated without considering phylogeny; we used one such model (Migrate-n) to estimate migration rates among the 6 described subspecies within M. lucifugus and M. evotis. Our results indicate that migration rates can be appreciable and differ by an order of magnitude across pairwise comparisons (Supplementary Table 5 ). However, doing so ignores the phylogenetic divergence within this clade, and thus we consider it to be an inappropriate application of the method. When nonequilibrium methods are used to estimate gene flow, the estimates of gene flow are much lower. For example, IMA (Hey and Nielsen 2007) was used to estimate gene flow, \u03b8 = 4N e \u03bc, and population divergence for several pairwise comparisons of subspecies. An advantage of IMA over its precursors is the capacity to evaluate the strength of support for a set of demographic models that reduce the parameters of the full model (e.g., \u03b8 A \u03b8 1 \u03b8 2 m 12 m 21 \u03c4) in various ways using information theory (Carstens et al. 2009) . Briefly, this method quantifies the probability of multiple models given the data thereby allowing researchers to identify the subset of parameters in the full model that represent important biological processes. For example, if all shared polymorphism is best explained by incomplete lineage sorting rather than migration, the selected models would not include migration parameters (e.g., it would only include \u03b8 A \u03b8 1 \u03b8 2 t). Results ( Supplementary Table 6 ) suggest VOL. 59 that gene flow is not an important parameter to include in the demographic model for 3 comparisons (M. l. alascensis-M. l. carissima; M. e. jonesorum-M. l. carissima; M. l. alascensis-M. e. jonesorum) but is necessary for one (M. e. chrysonotus-M. l. alascensis). Note that we do not have the level of phylogeographic sampling required to thoroughly investigate this question, but the approach outlined above may represent a useful method for exploring this question.",

Branch lengths in Figure 2 are not shown in the customary substitutions/site but rather in coalescent units equal to N generations. If we assume the rate of mutation used by Stadelmann et al. (2007) in their molecular dating of the Myotis radiation, our estimate of N e is \u223c300,000 (averaged across lineages). Generation lengths are in the range of 3-5 years, so one coalescent unit is equivalent to 1-1.5 My of divergence. This implies that most of the diversification within the M. lucifugus/western long-eared Myotis clade occurred during the Pleistocene.",

We also envision several ways that delimitation methods could be improved. Assuming that previously described sets of samples were used, delimitation efforts could proceed by more thoroughly exploring possible combinations. For example, rather than exhaustively calculating the likelihood of hierarchical models of subspecies, as we have done here, one could proceed by calculating all combinations of all subspecies either in an exhaustive manner or heuristically.",

Alternatively, one could parameterize lineage membership and use MCMC methods to approximate the posterior probability of lineage composition in addition to the species phylogeny. Finally, a exploration of the similarities and differences between phylogenetic approaches to delimitation and methods such as Structure (Pritchard et al. 2000) would be of great interest.
