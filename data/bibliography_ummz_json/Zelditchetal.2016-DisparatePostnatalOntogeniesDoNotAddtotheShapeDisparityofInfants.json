    "abstract": "Integrating studies of ontogeny with analyses of disparity can reveal important and surprising insights into the origins of disparity and why it varies among groups. One such potentially surprising insight is that disparity could be constant over ontogeny even though species differ in both rates and timings of development and in their ontogenetic changes in shape. Several studies of both primates and rodents have concluded that disparity is generated prenatally although some have concluded that it arises postnatally. However, neither constancy nor an ontogenetic increase in disparity has been ever been rigorously documented for either primates or rodents. For a small sample of rodents, we show that species differ in their postnatal ontogenies but infants are neither more nor less disparate than adults and the major dimensions of disparity distinguishing the main clades also do not change. The constancy in both the level of disparity and its main dimensions does not result primarily from the subtlety of postnatal differences. Those differences are indeed subtle but the disparity in directions of ontogenetic shape change is nonetheless sufficient to increase shape disparity significantly. Disparity does not increase postnatally primarily because ontogenies are not strictly linear; disparity generated postnatally counteracts that produced earlier. What limits the progressive accumulation of disparity is the curvature of ontogenetic trajectories, a curvature presumably due to ontogenetic changes in the spatial distribution of rates of bone deposition and resorption.",

Most studies focus on the disparity of adult size and shape but studies of ontogeny could make a useful and distinctive contribution to understanding disparity, and several recent studies have called for integrating analyses of ontogenetic allometry and disparity (e.g., Cr\u00f4nier and Congreve 2013; Gerber 2014; Piras et al. 2011; Wilson 2013) . Development, if not ontogeny, has been a main theme of studies that examine the macroevolutionary role of variability, especially the impact and evolution of morphological integration and modularity (e.g., Goswami et al. 2014; Denton and Adams 2015; Smith et al. 2015; Alvarez et al. 2015; Monteiro and Nogueira 2009) . Ontogeny, however, could provide novel insights into the origins of disparity because disparity arises from evolutionary changes in ontogeny, making ontogenetic allometry a natural bridge between analyses of ontogeny and disparity of size and shape. Not only would incorporating analyses of disparity in studies of ontogenetic allometry add information missing from conventional studies of disparity, it would also add information missing from conventional studies of ontogenetic allometry because those typically determine only in what, and by how much, species differ in their ontogenies. What is missing is the information about the impact of those changes on disparity.",

                "text": "Measuring the impact of disparate ontogenies on the disparity of morphology is needed to document a surprising conclusion drawn from many comparative studies of ontogeny: that most (or even all) of adult disparity is already present by the youngest developmental stage examined, except, perhaps, for that due to differences in developmental rate or timing (e.g., Ackermann and Krovitz 2002; Voss and Marcus 1992; Young 2008; Cole 1992; Boughner and Dean 2008; Cardini and Thorington 2006; Bjorklund 1996; Klingenberg 1998; Klingenberg and Ekau 1996; Klingenberg and Spence 1993; Verzi et al. 2010; Falsetti and Cole 1992) . There is no convincing explanation for that pattern, although it is consistent with the generalization that there is more flexibility for changes in early development, and for changes in overall developmental rate or timing, than for changes in relative growth rates that alter the direction of allometric growth (Klingenberg 1998) . What makes this pattern so difficult to explain is not the high disparity generated early in development but rather the modest impact of differences in direction of later growth that indicate evolutionary changes in the spatiotemporal patterns of growth. Although some of the studies emphasizing the impact of early development on disparity failed to detect differences in the direction of later growth, others recognize that species differ but nonetheless conclude that disparity arises early in development. The difficulty is thus to explain not just why early development generates high disparity but also why later growth does not even when species develop along different directions.",

One hypothesis for tightening functional constraints is that the complex biomechanical adjustments required to maintain effective masticatory function constrain weanlings but not embryos that need not function as biomechanically integrated wholes (Voss and Marcus 1992) . Alternatively, late development might be contingent on early development as suggested by developmental studies that trace the disparity of skeletal shape as far back as the process initiating skeletogenesis: mesenchymal condensation (Gruneberg and des Wickramaratne 1974) . Differences arising at such early stages of the process may drive the direction of postnatal growth (Young 2008) . Still another explanation is that natural selection targets the adult shape and indirectly affects early development, an explanation that presumes high genetic correlations between developmental stages (Price and Grant 1985) . A simpler explanation denies the basic premise of the generalization, i.e., the greater flexibility of early development. This explanation is based on the observation that developmental rates decrease over ontogeny (e.g., Zelditch et al. 2003a; Hingst-Zaher et al. 2000; Swiderski and Zelditch 2013; Fischer-Rousseau et al. 2009; Loy et al. 2001 ). Because of those higher rates, even modest differences in early development would have a larger impact on disparity than later, when developmental rates are low.",

                "text": "Countering all these explanations are the several studies that measure disparity at two or more stages because these document significant and often substantial changes in disparity over ontogeny. Several find that disparity increases over ontogeny, such as a doubling of disparity of craniofacial shape of eared seals (Otariidae) (Sanfelice and Freitas 2007) and even a quintupling of the disparity of damselfish neurocranial shape (Frederich and Vandewalle 2011) . Decreases can be equally impressive, such as a halving of body shape disparity in piranhas (Zelditch et al. 2003b) and an even larger decrease in the disparity of cranial shape in lacertid lizards (Ponssa and Candioti 2012) . However, none of these studies examine groups in which disparity is thought to be established largely (or entirely) by birth, most notably primates and rodents. Several recent studies, using modern methods of shape analysis, have shown that primates differ in their ontogenies of shape (Cobb and O'Higgins 2004; Collard and O'Higgins 2001; Mitteroecker et al. 2004; O'Higgins et al. 2001; Singleton 2002; Singleton et al. 2010; Strand Vioarsdottir and Cobb 2004) , but none have shown that disparity increases over ontogeny. Rodents, too, demonstrably differ in their ontogenies of shape; even species of Marmota, the least disparate clade of squirrels (Zelditch et al. 2015) , differ in directions of craniofacial and mandibular ontogeny (Cardini and O'Higgins 2005; Cardini and Thorington 2006 ). Yet, disparity of rodent craniofacial form is thought to be constant, or nearly so, after birth (Cardini and O'Higgins 2005; Cardini and Thorington 2006; Verzi et al. 2010; Voss and Marcus 1992) , although it is also argued that the disparity of adults arises from the disparity of postnatal allometries (Wilson 2013; Wilson and Sanchez-Villagra 2010) .",

The studies that trace disparity to early development are narrower in scope than the two that emphasize the role of disparate allometries. Of those that trace disparity to early development, two focus on species of Marmota (Cardini and O'Higgins 2005; Cardini and Thorington 2006) and one is restricted to species of Ctenomys (Verzi et al. 2010) . One is far broader, including two species from each of seven genera representing seven tribes of South American muroids (Voss and Marcus 1992) but it is the congeneric species that are examined most closely. Hence, it remains possible that the divergence of more distant relatives might not be established at birth. One of the two studies that trace disparity of adult form to disparate postnatal allometries sampled 17 species from each of two suborders Myormopha and Ctenohystricomorpha (Wilson and Sanchez-Villagra 2010) , and the other also includes 17 species of Sciuromorpha (Wilson 2013) . However, neither of those studies examined the disparity of neonates, leaving open the possibility that the disparity of adult form arises largely from divergence of early development, perhaps accentuated postnatally by the divergence of postnatal allometries.",

This tiny sample of the most diverse group of mammals cannot address the question: is the disparity of rodent shape constant over postnatal ontogeny? However, by including representatives of two suborders, and several closely related species in one suborder, we can address one question raised by the contrasts among previous studies, because studies that are more limited in phylogenetic scope favor the hypothesis that much or nearly all of disparity arises prenatally whereas broader studies emphasize allometric disparity as the cause of adult disparity. If early development plays the dominant role in generating the disparity of close relatives but not of more distant relatives in older clades, we would not expect constancy of disparity in our sample. We first compare ontogenies to determine by how much species differ in shape at birth, in their ontogenies of shape (due to differences in allometric patterns) and in rates of shape change and overall length of their ontogenetic trajectories. We then use simulations to quantify how much disparity would arise from each modification, taken separately and together, as well as how much disparity would arise if early development differs by no more than postnatal development does. To determine whether the ontogenetic dynamics of disparity that we discern in the analysis spanning two suborders owes to the large differences between sciuromorphs and myomorphs, we measure disparities for the sample as a whole and for just the six squirrels. We show that constancy of disparity is a realistic possibility even though postnatal growth is disparate both in allometric patterns and rates/timing.",

Three of the marmotines are closely related species: Callospermophilus lateralis, Otospermophilus variegatus and O. beecheyi, the other is Ammospermophilus leucurus. Relationships among species (Fabre et al. 2012; Zelditch et al. 2015) are shown in Fig. 1 . Sample sizes are given in Table 1 . Adult weights range over an order of magnitude and species span the continuum from precocial to altricial. One species, S. fulviventer, is known to be highly precocial and another, Heliosciurus rufobrachium probably also is, given information available for protoxerines including other Heliosciurus (Emmons 1979; Viljoen and Du Toit 1985; Viljoen 1981; Hayssen 2008) . The other species are altricial.",

However, a previous analysis found that mandibular shape ontogeny of M. musculus is not linearly related to size throughout ontogeny and that the ontogenetic trajectory of shape curves markedly in early postnatal development (Swiderski and Zelditch 2013) . Thus, we first analyze the Configurations of landmarks and semilandmarks analyzed in this study. The 10 landmarks (large circles) include the mental foramen, openings of incisor alveoli, tips of the posterior processes, and locations where those processes are connected to the ramus (or to the sheets of bone between processes); semilandmarks (small circles) provide information about curvature along posterior processes and the diastema relationship between size and shape in the three most complete ontogenetic series to determine whether the relationship between size and shape is (multivariately) linear. To that end, we examined the allometry scores for each specimen, which are obtained by projecting each individual's data on the vector of allometric coefficients, plotted relative to ln-transformed centroid size (LCS). We also examined the residuals (RSC1) to determine if they curve, suggesting an age-related pattern in the deviations from the linear models. These analyses were done using the plotAllometry function in geomorph. The relationship between size and shape and the ontogenetic trajectory of shape are visibly nonlinear in both M. musculus and O. beecheyi, especially at the smallest sizes ( Fig. 3) . We thus omitted the three youngest age-classes of M. musculus and the four smallest individuals of O. beecheyi. Although the residuals are heterogeneous in the sample of S. fulviventer, they suggest that there is another source of variation within the population rather than age-dependent allometries. Given these results, when predicting shape at the youngest comparable developmental stage, we predicted shape at the size when the incisor is nearly erupted. In all species save S. fulviventer, jaw size at this stage is appropriately 70 % of the adult size; in S. fulviventer, it is just 53 % of adult jaw size and jaw size in that species does not reach a value comparable to the other species until M 1 has erupted, 10 days after birth.",

Interspecific differences between the ontogenies are inferred when the ''Species'' 9 LCS interaction term is statistically significant, which could indicate differences in developmental rate and/or the directions of the allometric trajectories.

The difference in direction is quantified by the angle between trajectories; the cosine of the angle is the correlation between two vectors (calculated as the inner products between normalized vectors). To determine whether the angle is greater than expected by chance, we used a permutation test of the residuals of the reduced model, i.e., a model lacking the intercept term. By permuting the residuals of the reduced model, the main effect(s) are held constant; the observed angle can then be compared to the distribution of the random values to assess statistical significance (Adams and Collyer 2009; Anderson and ter Braak 2003; Collyer et al. 2014) . The same statistical approach can be used to test for differences in developmental rate, which is a rate of shape change relative to a unit change in LCS. These statistical analyses of the ontogenetic trajectories of shape were done using the advanced.procD.lm function in the geomorph package. To test for differences in length, we predicted the shape for each species at the smallest comparable stage and at the mean adult body size; we used the predicted shapes (plus residuals) in pairwise tests of the differences in mean shape. The comparison of trajectory lengths was done using the trajectory.analysis function in geomorph. In addition, we used another statistical approach that has been used in several comparative analyses of ontogeny, that of comparing the angle between species to the range of angles that can be obtained by bootstrap resampling of each species' ontogeny (e.g., Zelditch et al. 2000; Angielczyk and Feldman 2013; Sanfelice and Freitas 2007; Urosevic et al. 2013) . This is done by calculating residuals from the full model; residuals are bootstrapped to produce two bootstrap sets, and these are added to the expected value for shape at each specimen's size. The angle between these two vectors is calculated for each iteration of the bootstrap, yielding a distribution of the angles that could be obtained by resampling within a single population. The angle is judged to be significantly larger than 0 if it lies beyond the 95 % confidence interval for both bootstrap sets. This alternative procedure is useful because it also gives an estimate of the reliability of the angles.",

The angles range from just 16\u00b0-20\u00b0in comparisons between the three most closely related ground squirrels to 42.6\u00b0(between the two myomorphs).

The same pattern is evident in the analysis restricted to squirrels. Disparity that arises from variation in both lengths and directions of postnatal growth, starting from an invariant infant morphology, is far lower than if disparity arises from variation in prenatal development plus either disparity in length or direction (Fig. 9) . Disparity is comparable to the observed value when it arises from a combination of variation in prenatal development and the direction of postnatal ontogenetic trajectories (with length held constant); under those conditions, D = 0.0075, comparable to the observed value.

The height of the bar shows the mean value for disparity arising from variation in the one free parameter. P = the disparity of infants, arising prior to the youngest observed stage; L = the disparity arising solely from variation in the length of ontogenetic trajectories; D = disparity arising solely from variation in the direction of ontogenetic trajectories patterns and rates of postnatal growth. Not only is disparity nearly constant in magnitude, it is also nearly constant in the main dimensions of disparity. That constancy in both level and major dimensions of variation is not due to the negligible disparity introduced by postnatal growth. The disparity contributed by variation in trajectory length is indeed negligible; but that due to differences in postnatal allometry could increase disparity by 30-40 % of that produced prenatally. Disparity is nevertheless constant because the disparity generated postnatally is not added to that present at birth; instead, it modifies differences present at birth. The main dimensions are constant but in half the interspecific comparisons, disparity either increases or decreases, with increases balancing decreases and in 40 % of the comparisons, the direction in which the species differ rotates by at least 40\u00b0. Had species followed the same trajectories throughout the entire process of development and growth, disparity would increase continually, albeit at a decreasing rate. The simulation of constant growth rates also shows that the high disparity evident near birth is not due to the greater flexibility of early development because, in our simulation, early and late developmental trajectories are the same but the disparity at birth is twice the observed value and that of adults is an order of magnitude higher. Disparity does not increase postnatally because ontogenies are not strictly linear; the disparity generated postnatally counteracts that produced earlier. What limits the progressive accumulation of disparity is the curvature of ontogenetic trajectories, a curvature presumably due to ontogenetic changes in the spatial distribution of rates of bone deposition and resorption. Given our sparse sample of rodents, we cannot conclude that disparity is constant over postnatal rodent ontogeny. Clearly, our estimates of adult disparity are not credible estimates of rodent or even squirrel morphological disparity-we did not sample the most divergent squirrels, such as the specialized insectivore (Rhinosciurus laticaudatus), or bark-gleaning miniatures with their dramatically reduced coronoid processes or the exceptionally robust hard-endocarp specialists or flying squirrels. Moreover, three of the sampled species come from one of the least disparate clades of squirrels (Otospermophilus ? Callospermophilus). Obviously, our two distantly related and morphologically distinct myomorphs cannot provide a realistic estimate of the disparity of that group. Considering those limitations, what is surprising is that the range of allometric disparity in this small sample of rodents is so similar to those found in studies of other amniotes (Table 9 ). Most of the other studies examine craniofacial or mandibular ontogeny and those generally yield similar results; the angle between the craniofacial ontogenies of Mus musculus domesticus and Sigmodon fulviventer is 42.2\u00b0 (Zelditch et al. 2003a) , nearly identical to the 42.6\u00b0f ound herein for the mandible. A few species differ from one another by more than 60\u00b0, such as humans from other great apes, and several anthropoids from others in scapular ontogeny, but such large angles are rare when ontogenies are well-sampled. Not surprisingly, closely related and morphologically similar species, like Otospermophilus and Callospermophilus, differ little in their ontogenies, but even distantly related and morphologically disparate species rarely differ by more than 50\u00b0and it may not take long to diverge by that much considering that there are angles of 40\u00b0between species of Marmota and the crown age for that clade is only 5.8 Ma (Zelditch et al. 2015) .",

In the study of South American muroids, Voss and Marcus (1992) found that congeneric species differ, on average, by just 11.9\u00b0and species from different tribes differ, on average, by just 15.8\u00b0. Those are close to angles reported for comparisons between myomorphs (averaging 16.9\u00b0) and hystricomorphs (averaging 17.2\u00b0) (Wilson and Sanchez-Villagra 2010) , both of which are far higher than differences between sciuromophs, which average a mere 8.9\u00b0 (Wilson 2013) . But those very small angles are measured on a different scale. In studies of the ontogeny of shape, randomly related vectors differ, on average, by 90\u00b0b ut vectors of allometric coefficients for size measurements, which were used in the broad studies of rodents, cannot differ by 90\u00b0because allometric coefficients for size Fig. 9 Disparity arising from simulated ontogenies with a single fixed parameter; the other two are free, for all 8 species (left) and for the 6 squirrel species (right). The height of the bar shows the mean value for disparity arising from variation in the two free parameters when the indicated one is fixed. P = the disparity of infants arising prior to the youngest observed stage; L = the disparity arising solely from variation in the length of ontogenetic trajectories; D = disparity arising solely from variation in the direction of ontogenetic trajectories measurements are almost invariably positive numbers (unless the measurements actually shrink in development). Because they are positive numbers, and the sum of the products of corresponding coefficients are necessarily positive, they cannot sum to zero, hence the arccosine of that sum (the angle between trajectories) cannot be 90\u00b0. Instead, they may be less than 4\u00b0, as in comparisons to squirrels that are nearly isometric (Wilson 2013) , rising to C20\u00b0for the vectors of more heterogeneous coefficients characteristic of the other suborders, or even as high as 40\u00b0w",

In particular, in the most extreme case of no allometric disparity or divergence in early development, all of disparity would necessarily originate from differences in adult body size and/or in rates and timings of development. Those sources contribute only negligible disparity in our simulation, perhaps because the lengths of the ontogenetic trajectories in our sample differ so little. In groups that span more than an order of magnitude in body size, or that differ more in their life-histories than precocial and altricial rodents do, the disparity arising from ontogenetic scaling or heterochrony may be greater. Yet, our estimate of the disparity produced by variation solely in trajectory length may not be unrealistic considering how close it is to the disparity of adult shape of Podacris lizards, which apparently do evolve solely by heterochrony (Piras et al. 2011; Urosevic et al. 2013) . In that group, disparity (D) is approximately 0.0004 (Fig. 4, Urosevic et al. 2013) , close the value of 0.0003 obtained from our simulations. Several studies of primates have argued for a pervasive pattern of ontogenetic scaling or heterochrony (e.g., Shea 1983 Shea , 1989 Marroig 2007; Ravosa 1992 ) but they typically do not contend that disparity arises solely from those processes. No doubt heterochrony can generate far more disparity in groups that have a distinct larval phase, with some species retaining that larval morphology to sexual maturity, but in groups that have continuous life-cycles, ontogenetic scaling and heterochrony may be a cause of highly conservative morphologies.",

                "text": "Short of the extreme case of no allometric disparity at any developmental stage, it is difficult to predict the impact of allometric disparity on the disparity of adult morphology. Wilson (2013) concludes that squirrels have low allometric disparity and that their conservative ontogenies constrain adult disparity, and also that squirrels are conservative in their covariance structures (contrasting the general pattern of conserved covariance structures found in other mammalian groups). However, conservative covariance matrices were not documented in that study and postnatal allometric disparity, by itself, is not a predictor of morphological disparity. The range of allometric disparity within Marmota is nearly as large as in the rodents analyzed by us, yet, the disparity of adult mandibular shape in Marmota is just 0.00086 (Zelditch et al. 2015) , nearly an order of magnitude lower than in our sample (0.00748). The mean may be a better predictor than the range and no estimate of the mean is available for Marmota but there are two other studies that report the angles and the disparity of b Fig. 10 Morphospace of infant jaw shape based on the principal components of variation among species in mean jaw shape prior to the eruption of the deciduous premolar, P 4 (squirrels) or molar M 1 (myomorphs). a Disparity of all eight species; b disparity of the six species of squirrels shape, one for eared seals (Sanfelice and Freitas 2007) and the other for lacertid lizards (Urosevic et al. 2013) . That mean is highest in eared seals (42.1\u00b0vs. 28.1\u00b0for our sample and 25.8\u00b0for lacertid lizards). Adult shape disparity is also highest for eared seals, D = 0.0123. That value is close to twice the disparity of infants in our study and also far higher than the adult disparity of lacertid skull shape, D = 0.0021, an increase of 40-50 % over the disparity of infants, but it is just 30 % of the adult disparity of our sample of rodents. In groups that have an exceptionally large range of ontogenetic directions, disparity sometimes decreases substantially over ontogeny (Zelditch et al. 2003b; Adams and Nistri 2010) . In one case, that of the damselfish premaxilla, shape disparity increases but by less than that of other structures that are less disparate in their allometries (Frederich and Vandewalle 2011) . Disparate ontogenetic allometries can thus greatly increase the disparity of morphology but they can also decrease it. The impact of disparate allometries for morphological disparity depends both on the lengths of the ontogenetic trajectories and on their orientation relative to trajectories of early development.",
