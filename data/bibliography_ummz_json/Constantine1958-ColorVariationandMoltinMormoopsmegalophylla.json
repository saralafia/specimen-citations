S Concan, Uvalde Co., Texas, have provided a basis for the following review of color variation and molt in this form. Comparative specimens from within the range of Mormoops m. megalophylla Peters are considered of passing interest. It is not the intent of this paper to contest or confirm the taxonomic status of these forms, although indications are that this group deserves further taxonomic consideration. Therefore, the term senicula is used for convenience only, and the color descriptions must be considered primarily those derived from specimens collected at a single locality. Moreover, evidence suggests that ammonia fumes in Frio Cave bleach the pelage of two other species, so color values assigned here may not be applicable elsewhere.",
