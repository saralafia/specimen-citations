                "text": "Didelphids are morphologically primitive marsupials whose extant crown group (table 1) is widely distributed in temperate and tropical habitats of the New World. Didelphids have long been of interest to mammalian biogeographers as the most diverse surviving lineage of the old endemic fauna that evolved in South America throughout the long Tertiary isolation of that continent from neighboring land masses, and as the only substantially intact radiation of metatherian mammals outside Australasia (Simpson, 1971; Patterson and Pascual, 1972; Marshall, 1982) . Didelphids have been considered living exemplars of plesiomorphic or ''generalized'' therians by many experimental researchers (e.g., Crompton and Hiiemae, 1970; Jenkins, 1971; Jerison, 1973; Silveira et al., 1982; Harder, 1992; Frost and Masterton, 1994; Bedford, 1996) , whereas comparative biologists have studied morphological, behavioral, and physiological variation among didelphids to test adaptive hypotheses about the evolution of convergent traits among placental mammals (e.g., McNab, 1978; Eisenberg and Wilson, 1981; Charles-Dominique, 1983; Grand, 1983; Lemelin, 1999) . By contrast with the modest literature resulting from these more-or-less traditional motivations for didelphid research, the recent popularity of Monodelphis and Didelphis as model organisms for biomedical investigations has resulted in hundreds of papers on topics ranging from oncology to central nervous system regeneration following trauma (see reviews by VandeBerg, 1990; Archer et al., 1997; Krause et al., 1997; Martin and Wang, 1997; VandeBerg and Robinson, 1997) .",

To summarize briefly, the monophyly of only one suprageneric grouping-a clade of largebodied opossums with 2n \u03ed 22 chromosomes (Chironectes, Didelphis, Lutreolina, Philander)-is consistent with the published results of all four analyses. Some additional relationships, however, were supported by a simple majority of those studies that included appropriate generic exemplars, including (1) monophyly of the subfamily Didelphinae, (2) monophyly of a group consisting of species of Marmosa and Micoureus, (3) a sistergroup relationship of Thylamys with Lestodelphys, and (4) a sister-group relationship of Metachirus with the large-bodied 2n \u03ed 22 clade. Palma and Spotorno's subsequent (1999) analysis of mitochondrial 12S rRNA sequences (not reviewed by Jansa and Voss, 2000) provided additional support for the monophyly of Didelphinae, of the large 2n \u03ed 22 opossums, and of Marmosa \u03e9 Micoureus, but not for the sister-group relationship of Metachirus with the large-bodied 2n \u03ed 22 clade. Most of the taxa with conspicuously incongruent or unresolved relationships as indicated by these aggregate results are didelphines, notably Gracilinanus, Marmosops, Metachirus, and Monodelphis. The causes of incongruence among past analyses of didelphid phylogeny are hard to identify with certainty (Jansa and Voss, 2000) , but they plausibly include disparate taxon sampling (no two studies have analyzed relationships among the same set of taxa); use of nonmonophyletic supraspecific VOSS AND JANSA: DIDELPHID PHYLOGENY taxa as analytic terminals; discrepant scoring of the same characters in different morphological studies; different rooting criteria (outgroups versus reconstructed ancestors); and voucher misidentifications or tissue/voucher mismatches. Sampling error in resolving relationships is also implicated by the low bootstrap support for many nodes in those studies that reported such statistics (Patton et al., 1996; Palma and Spotorno, 1999) .",

Plausibly, some traditionally recognized groupings could have resulted from misinterpreted homologies, problematic polarity assessments, or inappropriate assumptions about evolutionary processes. Alternatively, nonmolecular data might provide compelling evidence for relationships that are not or are only weakly supported by our molecular results.",

Some characters were rejected because scoring them required uncommon specimen preparations (e.g., pouch young, serially sectioned skulls, isolated petrosals), the widespread absence of which would have resulted in more missing data than phylogenetically useful information. Several characters gleaned from the literature were difficult to interpret due to ambiguous state descriptors (e.g., ''normal'' versus ''reduced'') that could not be associated meaningfully with conditions observed in our material, and a few characters were found to be based on clearly erroneous observations. Relevant examples of such problems are discussed in the text or in footnotes, and an annotated list of rejected characters is provided in appendix 4. Our dataset includes both parsimony-informative characters and autapomorphies. The latter were scored for several reasons. First, scoring autapomorphies is sometimes necessary to preserve homologies in unordered multistate characters that contain parsimony-informative states. Second, scoring autapomorphies is required for meaningful comparisons of morphological and molecular branch lengths (Omland, 1997) . Third, including autapomorphies facilitates the recovery of taxon diagnoses from the data matrix, which would otherwise require supplementation for this purpose. Fourth, some traits that are autapomorphic among the taxa we examined could be parsimony-informative in a more taxon-dense analysis, so including them is useful for future applications of our dataset.",

Apparently, all coding conventions for inapplicable characters (e.g., morphology of the pouch in pouchless species) are unavoidably problematic (Maddison, 1993; Lee and Bryant, 1999; Strong and Lipscomb, 1999) , but reductive coding seems to be the best option (Wilkinson, 1995) . By this convention, the presence/absence and alternative conditions of a structure are scored as separate characters, with taxa lacking the structure in question scored as inapplicable for the character describing condition.

Unfortunately, most of the other methods discussed by Wiens (2000) seem indefensible because (1) they discard potentially useful phylogenetic information in the presence of rare variants (especially the ''fixed only '', ''polymorphic'', and ''missing'' options) , (2) because they require a priori distinctions between primitive and derived conditions that are inappropriate when reversals are phylogenetically informative (the ''any instance'' option), or (3) because they introduce unnecessary homoplasy (the ''unordered'' option). The ''unscaled'' option favored by Campbell and Frost (1993) , in which polymorphism is coded as a state intermediate to the fixed conditions with all state transformations assigned the same parsimony cost, has the unfortunate tendency to weight characters scored from common specimen preparations (e.g., adult dentitions, in which polymorphisms are more likely to be observed) more heavily than characters scored from uncommon preparations (e.g., fluid-preserved parous females), in which polymorphisms are seldom seen.",

Unfortunately, there is no biologically meaningful criterion for identifying rare variants as a distinct category of phenotypic traits that can be safely ignored by this method.

An alternative is to treat putative polymorphisms on a case-by-case basis, an approach that seems more realistic given the need to evaluate numerous alternative explanations for phenotypic variability (e.g., teratology, ontogeny, geographic variation) in real samples. In general, we scored the modal condition when this could be clearly recognized as such in our material. When no condition was observed to be conspicuously more frequent than another, however, we coded polymorphisms using the ''scaled'' option (Wiens, 2000) . By this convention, a character originally construed as binary (with two fixed conditions coded 0 and 1) would be recoded if a polymorphism were observed in one or more species. The recoded character would take the form of an ordered transformation series (0 \u2194 1 \u2194 2) with the intermediate state representing the polymorphism and the transformations 0 \u2194 1 and 1 \u2194 2 each having a weight of 0.5 relative to the unit weight (1.0) assigned to the transformation 0 \u2194 1 in a binary character without observed polymorphisms.

Procedures for DNA extraction and sequencing (including the names and locations of primers used in PCR reactions) were previously described by Jansa and Voss (2000) . Briefly, a region approximately 1.2 kb long of IRBP exon 1 was amplified from genomic DNA using primers A and D1. This product was used as a template in two subsequent PCR reactions, one using primer A paired with F and one using primers E1 and D1. The resulting PCR product was sequenced in both directions using amplification primers and dye terminator chemistry (either BigDye or dRhodamine Ready Reaction Kits, Applied Biosystems Inc.). All sequences analyzed in this report have been deposited in GenBank with accession numbers AF257675-AF247710 (from Jansa and Voss, 2000) and AY233765-AY233791 (from this project).",

For the purpose of combining molecular and nonmolecular data, however, we constructed a second matrix (''IRBP2'') with species as terminal taxa; in this matrix, intraspecific polymorphisms created by condensing conspecific sequences to single terminals were scored with appropriate IUPAC ambiguity codes. Because only a few species are represented by two or more nonidentical sequences in this study, modal states could seldom be identified as such, and no account was therefore taken of base frequencies when scoring polymorphisms (e.g., A-or-G was coded as R even if G was observed in two out of three conspecific individuals). We did not used the ''scaled'' option discussed above for nonmolecular character polymor-phisms because the resulting step matrices would have greatly increased the computational task of analyzing these data.",

Whereas some multistate nonmolecular characters were analyzed as ordered transformation series, IRBP sequence characters were always treated as unordered. All characters (nonmolecular and IRBP) were equally weighted in all analyses. Each heuristic parsimony search employed 1000 replicates of random taxon addition with TBR branch swapping. Bremer support (Bremer, 1994) for each resolved node in the strict consensus of equally most-parsimonious trees was calculated using TreeRot version 2a (Sorenson, 1999) to create the appropriate constraint files and PAUP* commands.

In order to reduce the computation time necessary for a thorough tree search, we performed all likelihood analyses on the condensed-taxon dataset (IRBP2). We first computed a neighbor-joining tree based on Jukes-Cantor corrected distances (Jukes and Cantor, 1969) , and we used that topology to calculate log-likelihood scores and to estimate relevant parameter values under eight models of nucleotide substitution: Jukes and Cantor (1969; JC69) , Felsenstein (1981; F81) , Hasegawa et al. (1985; HKY) , Tamura and Nei (1993; TrN) , Kimura (1980; K2P) , Kimura (1981; K3P) , Zharkikh (1994; SYM), and Rodriguez et al. (1990; GTR) . We also assessed whether including parameters for site-specific rate heterogeneity (the \u232b-distributed rate parameter; Yang, 1994) and for a proportion of invariant sites (I) improved the fit of the model to the data. Lastly, we evaluated whether enforcing a molecular clock provided a better fit to the data than allowing substitution rates to vary from branch to branch across the tree. We accepted as the best-fit model that one for which additional parameters no longer significantly improved the log-likelihood score, as determined by likelihood-ratio tests (Goldman, 1993; Huelsenbeck and Rannala, 1997) . For such tests, twice the difference in log-",

In the event that two datasets analyzed separately support significantly incongruent phylogenetic hypotheses, some authors (e.g., Bull et al., 1993) have argued that a combined analysis is unjustified, but no effective method for mediating dataset conflicts has been proposed for such cases. Potential advantages of combined-data analysis (whether or not separate analyses produce incongruent results) include increased phylogenetic resolution (because different datasets are sometimes informative at different taxonomic levels; e.g., Pennington, 1996) , the discovery of robust clades not (or only weakly) supported by separate analyses (e.g., Gatesy et al., 1999b; Gatesy and Arctander, 2000) , and the avoidance of arbitrariness in recognizing data partitions (Baker and DeSalle, 1997; Siddall, 1997; Wetterer et al., 2000) .",

Indeed, entire classes of external characters have been ignored as sources of phylogenetic information. Patterns of integumental pigmentation, for example, are commonly described in the alpha-taxonomic literature (e.g., by Thomas, 1888; Tate, 1933; Hershkovitz, 1992b Hershkovitz, , 1997 , but none has been coded for analysis in previous studies of didelphid relationships. Such inattention is hard to justify because some pelage markings exhibit less intraspecific variation and are easier to score as discrete states than are many routinely analyzed craniodental attributes. The following character descriptions are organized in a rostral-to-caudal sequence and include all phylogenetically informative traits that are more easily scored by external examination than by dissection or skeletal preparation, regardless of whether or not they are properly considered integumental. Thus, tax- onomic differences in digital proportions are described below despite their obviously osteological basis. Except as noted otherwise below, our terminology for external morphological features follows usages defined or referenced by Brown (1971) and Brown and Yalden (1973) .",

Instead, many have a mesaxonic manus in which dIII is distinctly longer than the other fingers; taxa that we scored as exhibiting this condition include Chironectes, Didelphis, Lestodelphys, Lutreolina, Marmosops, Metachirus, Monodelphis, Philander, and Thylamys. A third alternative condition is seen in Caluromys and Caluromysiops, in which manual digit IV is distinctly longer than dIII.

By contrast, pedal digits II, III, and IV are subequal (none distinctly longer than the others) in Didelphis albiventris and D. virginiana. Among all other examined didelphid taxa (including Didelphis marsupialis), the second, third, and fourth pedal digits progressively increase in length, such that dIV is the longest toe opposing the hallux (see Boas, 1918: figs. 2, 3) . Although taxonomic variation in pedal digit lengths was previously scored for phylogenetic analysis by Creighton (1984: character 9) , his observations for Lestodelphys (said to have a long fourth digit) and Lutreolina (said to have subequal third and fourth digits) differ inexplicably from ours. Note that the states of this character do not covary with those of character 10, as might be expected if transformations of manual and pedal morphology were functionally or developmentally determined by the same factors.

In most pouchless didelphids (e.g., Glironia, Marmosa, Micoureus, Metachirus, some species of Marmosops, and some species of Monodelphis), the mammae are confined to a more-or-less circular inguinal/abdominal array that occupies the same anatomical position as the pouch does in taxa that possess a marsupium. In other pouchless didelphids (e.g., Lestodelphys and Marmosops incanus), however, bilaterally paired mammae extend anteriorly well beyond the pouch region. Although most of these anterior teats are not actually located on the upper chest, they are usually referred to as ''pectoral'' mammae by authors (e.g., Tate, 1933; Reig et al., 1987: character 42) . Because the presence or absence of pectoral mammae cannot be confidently inferred from published teat counts (e.g., those tabulated by Bresslau, 1920) , and because unused mammae are inconspicuous, examination of wellpreserved parous adult females is essential for accurate scoring of this character. We were unable to examine suitable material of Gracilinanus microtarsus ourselves, but we scored pectoral mammae as present in this taxon based on Tate's (1933: 193) description and illustration (op. cit.: fig. 3 ) of a fluid specimen formerly preserved in the British Museum of Natural History (BMNH 82.9.30.42). 4 We scored Caluromysiops irrupta as having only inguinal/abdominal mammae based on the reported presence of a pouch in that taxon (see character 17, above). Tate (1933) and Reig et al. (1987) reported pectoral mammae as present in Monodelphis, but the Monodelphis speci-mens we examined had only abdominal/inguinal teats. Lacking suitable material, we scored Micoureus paraguayanus, Monodelphis theresa, Thylamys pallidior, and T. venustus as missing (''?'') for this character.",

In most didelphids the openings of the urogenital and rectal ducts are closely juxtaposed and share a continuous mucosa. In life, both openings are normally recessed in a common sinus (cloaca), but this feature is obscured in male specimens with everted genitalia. Chironectes uniquely lacks a cloaca because the urogenital and rectal openings are widely separated by furred skin (Oliver [1976: fig. 1 ] correctly illustrated this morphology in the female, but his illustration of the male omits the urogenital orifice). Scoring this character requires fluid-preserved specimens, which were unavailable for Marmosa rubra (scored as missing [''?''] in our matrix). In a few cases, relevant published information was used to score taxa that we were unable to examine (e.g., Nogueira et al.'s [1999a] description of Glironia), but the literature also contains misleading information about didelphid cloacal anatomy. Hershkovitz (1992a: 203-205; 1992b : 11-13) reported a diversity of cloacal types among marsupials, including: (1) consistent lack of separation between the urogenital and rectal openings (cloaca present in both sexes); (2) male urogenital and rectal openings separated by a ''perineal membrane'' or ''perineum'' (cloaca absent in males, present in females); and (3) consistent separation of urogenital and rectal openings (cloaca absent in both sexes). He explicitly attributed the first condition to Caluromys, Gracilinanus, and some species of Marmosa; the second to Caluromysiops, Marmosops, Metachirus, and Micoureus; and the third to the large 2n \u03ed 22 opossums (''didelphids'' in his usage).",

For example, adult male specimens of Caluromys lanatus (supposedly representing cloacal type 1; e.g., AMNH 273038) and Caluromysiops irrupta (type 2; e.g., FMNH 60398) exhibit identical arrangements of the urogenital and rectal openings. Likewise, Nogueira et al.'s (1999b) detailed study of male reproductive anatomy did not reveal any differences in the cloacal anatomy of Caluromys (allegedly type 1), Metachirus (type 2), and Didelphis (type 3). The only plausible explanation for Hershkovitz's unrepeatable and clearly problematic observations is that they resulted from careless interpretation of preservational artifacts. 5 Character 21: Body pelage extends onto tail conspicuously farther dorsally than ventrally (0); or body pelage extends onto dorsal and ventral surfaces of tail to about the same extent (1); or body pelage does not extend appreciably onto tail (2). Body pelage, here defined as soft fur composed of ordinary coat hairs that are not associated with epidermal scales, extends to a variable extent onto didelphid tails. Body fur extends onto the tail much farther dorsally than ventrally in Caluromys lanatus, Caluromysiops, Glironia, Monodelphis brevicauda, and M. emiliae. By contrast, body fur extends onto the tail dorsally and ventrally to about the same extent (from about one-sixth to about one-third the length of that organ) in Caluromys philander, Chironectes, Didelphis, Lutreolina, Micoureus paraguayanus, and Philander. In the remaining taxa examined for this study (Gracilinanus, Lestodelphys, Marmosa, Marmosops, Metachirus, Micoureus demerarae, M. regina, Monodelphis adusta, M. theresa, Thylamys) body fur does not extend more than a short distance onto the tail base (less than or equal to about one-eighth of caudal 5 Other remarks about reproductive anatomy in Hershkovitz's marsupial publications are inaccurate and support the conclusion that his observations were cursory. For example, the statement that Caluromysiops and Chironectes differ from other didelphids by having a ''simple'' (undivided) glans penis (Hershkovitz, 1992b: 13) is not supported by any material that we have seen. Although a fluid-preserved adult male Caluromysiops that Hershkovitz examined (FMNH 60398) superficially appears to have an undivided penis because only one hemipene is extruded from the prepuce, the other half can be viewed by gently enlarging the preputial orifice with a probe. In fact, Caluromysiops and Chironectes have divided (''bifid'') glandes like those of other didelphids. length). In the absence of any obvious intermediates among these alternative conditions, we treated this character as unordered in all of our analyses.",

Although all didelphids are perhaps capable of caudal prehension to some extent, external morphological features associated with this behavior are variably developed in the family. The unfurred caudal surfaces of Chironectes, Lestodelphys, Lutreolina, Metachirus, and Monodelphis are covered with unmodified scales (each bearing three or more bristles) from base to tip. In taxa conforming to this morphology, the tail-tip may be provided with a smooth terminal button, but never with a ventrally expanded apical pad bearing dermatoglyphs. The tails of all other didelphids are provided with a distal prehensile surface that may be smooth or covered by modified scales (conspicuously unlike those of the caudal dorsum) but is always transversely creased and glabrous; in taxa conforming to this morphology, the tail-tip is invariably provided with a ventrally expanded pad bearing dermatoglyphs (da Silva and Langguth, 1989: fig 1b; Hershkovitz, 1997: fig. 7 ). Creighton's (1984: character 19) coding of caudal prehensile modifications was based in part on the presence or absence of a median groove or sulcus, a distinction that we were unable to recognize consistently in our material. Additionally, his scoring of Metachirus and Lutreolina as indistinguishable from Philander and Didelphis in morphological traits associated with caudal prehension is inconsistent with our observations.",

Although individual cutaneous scales are often hard to dis-NO. 276 BULLETIN AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY tinguish in Monodelphis, the caudal hairs of species that we examined usually emerge from the skin in triplets, a condition that we interpreted as corresponding to state 0. Because the entire caudal dorsum is covered with body fur and the entire caudal ventrum is more-or-less glabrous and modified for prehension in Glironia, we were unable to code it for this character. We were also unable to confidently determine the state of this character in Lestodelphys based on the dried skins at hand. Both Glironia and Lestodelphys are therefore scored as missing (''?'') in our matrix. Creighton (1984: character 20) scored Philander as having three hairs per caudal scale, but our material of P. frenata, P. mcilhennyi, and P. opossum consistently exhibits four or more hairs per scale, the same condition described and illustrated for this genus by Hershkovitz (1997: 14, fig. 8 ). According to Creighton's text, only Chironectes and Lutreolina have more than three hairs per caudal scale, but his matrix (op. cit.: table 5) records this condition for Lutreolina and Metachirus. Four hairs emerge from beneath some ventral scales near the base of the tail in our material of Chironectes, but the modal count dorsally and distally is three in that genus, as it is in Metachirus.",

In Caluromys, Caluromysiops, Glironia, Marmosa (except M. rubra), and Micoureus, the postorbital processes are flattened and more-or-less triangular projections of the supraorbital crests that shield the dorsal margin of the eye cavity. By contrast, the postorbital processes in Chironectes, Didelphis, Lutreolina, and Philander are bluntly pyramidal or horn-like projections that are not associated with supraorbital crests. Because frontal outgrowths develop late in postweaning ontogeny (Abdala et al., 2001) , it is important that this character be scored from examination of large adult skulls. As none of the observed states of frontal morphology appear to be obviously intermediate to the others, this character was treated as unordered in our analysis.",

In large adult specimens of Caluromys, Lestodelphys, and Monodelphis, however, a small sagittal crest is sometimes developed over the interparietal or along the midparietal suture.

In taxa conforming to this morphology (Caluromys, Caluromysiops, Chironectes, Didelphis, Glironia, Lutreolina, Marmosa, Metachirus, Micoureus, Monodelphis, Philander) , there is no petrosal exposure through openings on the lateral surface of the braincase. By contrast, the petrosal capsule that encloses the paraflocculus and semicircular canals (\u03ed pars canalicularis or pars mastoideus) is consistently exposed through a fenestra in the suture between the squamosal and parietal in Gracilinanus, Thylamys, and some species of Marmosops. Both conditions occur as polymorphisms (neither state clearly predominating) in Lestodelphys, Marmosops incanus, and M. noctivagus. For Marmosa lepida we coded the unambiguously modal condition (no lateral petrosal exposure) despite a single specimen (MNHN 1998-306 ) with a distinct fenestra in the squamosal-parietal suture on both sides of the skull. As for other transformation series involving polymorphic states, we treated this character as ordered (0 \u2194 1 \u2194 2) in all of our analyses with transformations between adjacent states assigned a parsimony cost of 0.5.",

In caluromyines (Caluromys, Caluromysiops, Glironia) the posterior palate slopes ventrally without any abrupt inflection, the caudal palatal margin is usually broadly arched, and prominent lateral corners are not developed; behind the palate, the internal choanae are not strongly constricted ( fig. 6A ). By contrast, the posterior palate of didelphines is abruptly inflected ventrally, and the caudal palatal margin is more-or-less straight with prominent lateral corners; behind the palate, the choanae are strongly constricted ( fig. 6B ). Rather than scoring each of these transformations (slope of the palatal roof, shape of the palatal margin, etc.) separately, we recognize a pattern of correlated changes that appears to involve a reorientation of the oral airway.

The typical didelphid condition (presence) is clearly depicted by Wible (1990: fig. 1 ), but the transverse canal foramen is sometimes incorrectly identified in other published illustrations of didelphid skulls (e.g., by Hershkovitz [1992b: fig. 18; fig. 11 ], who mislabeled it as the ''foramen rotundum''). 7 Caluromys and Caluromysiops, however, lack a transverse canal foramen (Archer, 1976a; S\u00e1nchez-Villagra and Wible, 2002) . According to Kirsch and 7 Because Hershkovitz's publications on didelphid systematics are profusely illustrated and widely consulted for anatomical information, it should be recognized that some basicranial foramina are misidentified in his figures. In addition to the problem noted above, the carotid foramen (\u03ed anterior carotid foramen of Wible, 1990: fig. 1 ) is often labeled as the ''foramen ovale,'' the foramen ovale as the ''anterior lacerate foramen or petrotympanic fissure,'' and the secondary foramen ovale as the ''carotid foramen or canal'' (Hershkovitz, 1992b: fig. 18; 1997: fig. 11; 1999: figs. 7, 25) . Confusingly, these misidentifications are not consistent. For example, the opening labeled as the foramen rotundum on each side of the skull in other figures (e.g., Hershkovitz, 1999: fig. 25 ) is a nonvascular fenestra rather than the transverse canal foramen, but the foramen rotundum is sometimes correctly labeled in figures adjacent to those in which it is not (e.g., Hershkovitz, 1992b: fig. 19; fig. 12 ).",

The transverse canal foramen is occasionally present unilaterally, and it is absent on both sides of the skull in rare examples of some species that otherwise consistently exhibit these openings.

S\u00e1nchez-Villagra and Wible (2002) analyzed the presence or absence of an intramural connection between the left and right transverse canal foramina in their recent survey of didelphid basicranial characters, but confident scoring of this feature requires sectioned or suitably broken skulls, which were not available for the large majority of taxa included in our study.",

The openings through which the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve (V 3 ) exits the skull have been variously named by systematists. Following Gaudin et al. (1996) , we use the term ''foramen ovale'' for the primary orifice through which V 3 exits the endocranial lumen of the adult skull. In most didelphids, the foramen ovale is bordered by the alisphenoid and the petrosal ( fig. 8A ), but the foramen is sometimes contained entirely within the alisphenoid, and both conditions wing of the alisphenoid (twa) across the transverse canal foramen (tcf); the nerve then emerges from a so-called secondary foramen ovale. Another kind of secondary enclosure is seen in Monodelphis, where the nerve emerges from a secondary foramen ovale formed by a medial lamina (lam) of the alisphenoid tympanic wing. Other abbreviations: bs, basisphenoid; bo, basioccipital; cc, carotid canal; ect, ectotympanic. can be seen on opposite sides of the same skull (see Gaudin et al., 1996: fig. 6 ). Because it is often difficult to determine the position of this opening with respect to relevant endocranial sutures, however, we did not score the position of the foramen ovale per se. Instead, secondary enclosures of V 3 by outgrowths of the alisphenoid tympanic wing provide a more accessible basis for taxonomic comparisons. Gaudin et al. (1996) distinguished three states of secondary enclosure of the mandibular nerve by alisphenoid outgrowths among marsupials: absence (no secondary enclosure), incomplete enclosure (presence of a secondary foramen but no canal), and complete enclosure (presence of a canal continuous with the primary foramen). Among didelphids, however, there are two different (apparently nonhomologous) conditions of secondary nerve enclosures that are not distinguished by this coding scheme.",

In most didelphids (Glironia, Gracilinanus, Lestodelphys, Marmosa, Marmosops, Metachirus, Micoureus, Monodelphis, Thylamys) the anterior (dorsal) limb of the ectotympanic (tympanic annulus) is directly connected to the skull near the point where the squamosal, alisphenoid, and petrosal are juxtaposed behind the postglenoid process. Where the connection can be seen clearly (dried remnants of soft tissues frequently obscure this feature), the actual attachment usually seems to be to the petrosal ( fig. 9A ). Alternatively (in Caluromys, Caluromysiops, Chironectes, Didelphis, Lutreolina, and Philander), the anterior limb of the ectotympanic is not directly attached to the skull, and the suspension of the tympanic annulus is indirect, via the tympanic (anterior) process of the malleus (fig. 9B) .",

Whereas the ectotympanic (ect) is suspended from the skull by attachments both to the petrosal (pet) and to the malleus (mal) in Marmosops, the ectotympanic of Philander is suspended only from the malleus (there is no attachment to the petrosal).

(1987: character 31) , and Goin and Rey (1997: character 11) , but their discrepant observations (e.g., regarding Metachirus and Monodelphis) reflect the difficulty of unambiguously distinguishing degrees of ectotympanic expansion, or (perhaps) differences in the species-level exemplars chosen to represent generic terminals in those analyses (see Jansa and Voss, 2000: 70-71) .",

In most didelphid and extinct metatherian petrosals, the fenestra cochleae is completely exposed in lateral or ventrolateral view (as illustrated for Didelphis by Wible, 1990: fig. 1 ). In Caluromys, Caluromysiops, Lestodelphys, Marmosa rubra, Monodelphis emiliae, and Thylamys, however, the fenestra cochleae is concealed within a chamber or sinus formed by a laminar outgrowth of the pars canalicularis that approximates or contacts an expanded rostral tympanic process of the pars cochlearis. This lamina, which appears to be homologous with the caudal tympanic process of Mac-Phee (1981) , is invariably fused posteroventrally with the paroccipital process (of the exoccipital), which also throws forward a small ''tympanic'' outgrowth. Wroe et al. (2000: characters 66, 67 ) coded what appears to be the same taxonomic variation as two characters (one each for the ''paroccipital tympanic process'' and the ''mastoid tympanic process''), but only a single anatomical transformation (sinus formation) is apparent to us among the taxa included in this study. S\u00e1nchez-Villagra and Wible (2002) recorded In Lestodelphys the dorsal margin of the foramen magnum (fm) is formed by the excoccipitals (exo) and the supraoccipital (sup), but in adult specimens of Metachirus the right and left exocciptals are joined to exclude the supraoccipital from the dorsal margin of the foramen. Another conspicuous taxonomic difference illustrated in these views concerns the parocciptal process (pp), which is a small, inconspicuous bony mass adnate to the pars mastoideus (mas) of the petrosal in Lestodelphys. By contrast, the paroccipital process of Metachirus is much larger and projects almost straight ventrally.

The paroccipital process of the exoccipital is inconspicuous in most didelphids, consisting of a low, rounded or subtriangular bony mass for muscle attachment that is broadly adnate to the petrosal; the indistinct apex of the process in taxa that conform to this widespread condition is directed posteroventrally (fig.  10A, B) . By contrast, in Chironectes, Didelphis, Lutreolina, Metachirus, and Philander the paroccipital process is much larger, more erect, and points almost straight ventrally in most examined specimens ( fig. 10C, D) . Kirsch and Archer (1982: character 51) coded the paroccipital process as ''long'' in most of the didelphids included in their analysis (Caluromys, Chironectes, Didelphis, Glironia, Lutreolina, Marmosa, Metachirus, Monodelphis, Philander) versus ''very small but not absent'' in Lestodelphys. However, we were not able to distinguish any aspect of paroccipital morphology that corresponded to their pattern of taxonomic scoring in our material. Instead, the condition of the paroccipital process in Lestodelphys appeared to be indistinguishable from the widespread morphology among small didelphids, which includes a modest range of intergrading forms but not the hypertrophied state seen in Metachirus and the 2n \u03ed 22 opossums. Rougier et al. (1998) and Wible et al. (2001) used the term ''paracondylar'' for the muscular process of the exoccipital (after Evans and Christensen, 1979), 8 reserving ''paroccipital'' for a muscular process of the petrosal, but our usage follows Coues (1872), Flower (1885) , and most other works of comparative mammalian osteology. That the two structures are homologous (as bony sites for muscle attachment) is suggested by the fact that no taxon scored by Rougier et al. (1998) and Wible et al. (2001) for the ''paracondylar'' character (number 135 in their matrix) and for the paroccipital character (number 131) was observed to have both processes. On this hypothesis, future analyses of basal therian relationships should include one character for presence/absence of a paroccipital process and another for its position (on the petrosal or exoccipital).",

The dorsal margin of the foramen magnum is formed by the exoccipitals and the supraoccipital in most didelphids ( fig. 10A ), but medial processes of the left and right exoccipitals are joined at the midline above the foramen magnum (excluding the supraoccipital from the dorsal margin of that opening; fig.  10C ) in adult specimens of Didelphis, Lutreolina, Metachirus, and Philander. Juvenile (and some subadult) specimens of these four genera, however, resemble other didelphids in their occipital morphology, such that both states can be observed in ontogenetic series of conspecific skulls (see Abdala et al., 2001 : fig. 3 ). S\u00e1nchez-Villagra and Wible (2002) coded Chironectes as exhibiting the same morphology as the four genera listed above, but the supraoccipital forms part of the dorsal margin of the foramen magnum in all of the ten specimens of Chironectes that we examined for this character (not all of the adult skulls listed in appendix 1 have visible occipital sutures).

Therefore, the 14 postcanine teeth of adult didelphids appear to be P1/p1, P2/p2, P3/p3, M1/m1, M2/m2, M3/m3, and M4/m4. 9 The nomenclature for molar occlusal structures mentioned in the following accounts is illustrated by Bown and Kraus (1979: fig. 9 -1) and by Reig et al.

Occlusal features that are easily distinguished on unworn juvenile or subadult dentitions are often obliterated by wear in adults; therefore, we scored most of the following characters from immature specimens.

Some care is needed in scoring this character because posterior accessory cusps are sometimes obliterated by attrition (as inferred from their absence in old adults of species that uniformly exhibit such structures as juveniles and subadults). Alternatively, a false accessory cusp is sometimes formed when the posterior edge of C1 is notched by occlusion with p1. Therefore, confident scoring of this character should be based on unworn dentitions. Because no didelphid known to us has an anterior cusp without having a posterior cusp, state 1 appears to represent an intermediate condition in the premolarization of C1.

In all of the remaining didelphids we examined, however, the anterior margin of the tooth is rounded, and only the posterior cutting edge is well developed. Small anterior blades are variably present near the base of P3 in Chironectes and Philander, but the apex of the tooth is always rounded anteriorly as in the other taxa that we code with state 1. Other workers have remarked marsupial variation in P3, distinguishing ''inflated'' or ''bulbous'' teeth on the one hand from ''laterally compressed'', ''bladelike'', or ''normal'' teeth on the other, but we are unable to recognize these descriptors as distinct alternatives among the taxa included in our analysis. Contradictory coding for P3 morphology in different studies (e.g., Didelphis, scored as ''bulbous'' by Reig et al. [1987: character 24] , but as ''laterally compressed'' by Wroe et al. [2000: character 6] ) clearly indicates the ambiguity of such undefined contrasts.

The shape of the centrocrista (postparacrista \u03e9 premetacrista) and the descriptive nomenclature associated with its alternative states have been a source of some confusion among marsupial researchers. Traditionally, taxa with a V-shaped (labially inflected) centrocrista have been described as ''dilambdodont'' because the ectoloph (preparacrista \u03e9 centrocrista \u03e9 postmetacrista) is then W-shaped (like two inverted lambdas), whereas taxa with a straight (uninflected) centrocrista have usually been called ''predilambdodont'' (e.g., by Reig et al., 1987) . Unfortunately, neither descriptor applies unambiguously to some didelphids , and certain taxa have been coded with contradictory character states in different phylogenetic datasets. Didelphis, for example, was coded as having a V-shaped centrocrista by Reig et al. (1987: character 1) and Wible et al. (2001: character 31) , but Wroe et al. (2000: character 10) scored it as having a linear centrocrista. Our coding reflects Johanson's (1996) observation that the shape (linearity versus labial inflection) of this crest is correlated with its occlusal relief (apical height above the trigon basin), and we recognize an intermediate condition for taxa that do not conform with either traditionally recognized morphotype.",

By contrast, the centrocrista is strongly inflected labially (buccally)and therefore distinctly V-shaped-in Gracilinanus, Lestodelphys, Marmosa, Marmosops, Metachirus, Micoureus, Monodelphis, and Thylamys; the apex of the crest is ele- vated well above the trigon floor in these taxa, which are unambiguously dilambdodont sensu Johanson (1996) . The intermediate condition occurs in the six remaining genera (Caluromys, Chironectes, Didelphis, Glironia, Lutreolina, Philander) in which the centrocrista has a weak labial inflection with a slightly elevated apex; these taxa could appropriately be described as weakly dilambdodont.

In many didelphids (Caluromys, Caluromysiops, Glironia, Gracilinanus, Marmosa, Marmosops parvidens, Micoureus) the preprotocrista passes labially around the base of the paracone to join with the anterolabial cingulum, forming a continuous shelf along the anterior margin of the crown of each of the first three maxillary molars ( fig. 13, left) . In the alternative morphology exhibited by Chironectes, Didelphis, Lestodelphys, Lutreolina, Marmosops (except M. parvidens), Metachirus, Monodelphis, Philander, and Thylamys, the preprotocrista extends only to a point at or near the base of the paracone; the anterolabial cingulum does not converge toward the preprotocrista in these taxa, but passes obliquely dorsally such that the two crests are discontinuous on the anterior surface of the tooth crown ( fig. 13, right) . Because this occlusal feature sometimes varies along the toothrow, we standardized our taxonomic scoring by recording the condition observed on M3. Archer (1976b: characters 31, 32) , Creighton (1984: character 53) , and Wroe et al. (2000: character 25) referred to state 0 as comprising a ''complete'' anterior cingulum, and state 1 as an ''incomplete or absent'' cingulum. However, whereas Creighton and Wroe et al. reported essentially the same taxonomic variation that we observed, Archer recorded the presence of a complete cingulum in Philander opossum, a species (and genus) that uniformly lacks this feature in our material. Similarly, Rougier et al. (1998) and Wible et al (2001: character 33) scored the preprotocrista of Didelphis as extending labially beyond the base of the paracone, an apparent lapsus; in all specimens of Didelphis that we examined, the preprotocrista terminates at the base of the paracone with no trace of a labial extension.",

(2001: table 5) . Many didelphids (Caluromys lanatus, Caluromysiops, Chironectes, Didelphis, Lutreolina, Marmosops, Metachirus, Monodelphis emiliae, Philander) have a fully molariform dp3 in which the trigonid is represented by its normal complement of three cusps (paraconid, protoconid, metaconid) in a more-or-less triangular configuration ( fig.  15, top) . A fully molariform dp3 is also the modal condition for Monodelphis brevicaudata, in which seven of nine specimens examined with intact milk dentitions had complete trigonids. By contrast, dp3 is only partially molariform in Lestodelphys, Marmosa, Micoureus, and Thylamys, which have incomplete, blade-like trigonids bearing only one or two distinct cusps (fig. 15, bottom) . Scoring Caluromys philander for this character was somewhat problematic because only the protoconid of dp3 is usually distinct in our material, but the trigonid is triangular in outline and more closely resembles the fully molariform condition than the bladelike bicuspid alternative. We did not examine juvenile specimens of several taxa (Glironia, Gracilinanus, Marmosops incanus, Micoureus paraguayanus, Monodelphis adusta, M. theresa, and Philander frenata) that are scored as missing (''?'') in our matrix.",

(1987: character 36) coded didelphid karyotypic variation as a single character with different diploid numbers (14, 18, and 22) as alternative states, the transformational homologies suggested by Gbanding patterns are more appropriately coded as separate characters, one for each set of Robertsonian equivalents-for example, {acr2 \u03e9 acr8, met2}-which can exist in two states: fused (metacentric) or fissioned (acrocentric). Two character-state changes would then distinguish taxa with 2n \u03ed 14 from those with 2n \u03ed 18, and two additional changes would separate taxa with 2n \u03ed 18 from those with 2n \u03ed 22. (Note that, in applications of data resampling procedures, treating each Robertsonian transformation as a different character is not computationally equivalent to weighting each transformation of the series 14 \u2194 18 \u2194 22 by a factor of two.) The crucial issue here is the independence or nonindependence of different fission/fusion events. Perhaps the most persuasive argument for nonindependence is that there are no known didelphids with 2n \u03ed 16 or 2n \u03ed 20 chromosomes, but such complements are clearly not impossible because they have been reported from various Australasian marsupials (Hayman, 1990: table 1) .",

First and third positions show the highest GC content (63.4-66.8% at first positions, 61.5-65.5% at third positions), whereas second positions show equivalent bias towards adenine and thymine (the range of AT content at second positions is 60.9-61.1%).

                "text": "None of the ingroup relationships that are strongly supported (with Bremer support \u03fe3 and bootstrap values \u03fe90%) by our analysis of nonmolecular characters is controversial. Monophyly of the subfamily Didelphinae, monophyly of the large 2n \u03ed 22 opossum group, and monophyly of Lestodelphys \u03e9 Thylamys were all previously suggested by Creighton (1984) and Reig et al. (1987) based on their independent analyses of nonmolecular data, despite the fact that those studies differed significantly from each other and from ours in character composition. Apparently, these clades are robust to alternative criteria for nonmolecular character choice. Monophyly of the genus Monodelphis has been assumed (at least implicitly) by morphological systematists, but it has not previously been tested by phylogenetic analyses of nonmolecular data. All four groups (Didelphinae, the large 2n \u03ed 22 opossums, Lestodelphys \u03e9 Thylamys, and Monodelphis) are also strongly supported by parsimony analyses of IRBP sequences (Jansa and Voss, 2000) , and they are consistent with phylogenetic interpretations of DNA-DNA hybridization experiments (Kirsch et al., 1997) . In effect, these relationships seem to be established beyond any serious doubt, despite some conflicting results from cytochrome b (Patton et al., 1996) . 11 The only other didelphine clade that is even moderately well supported by nonmolecular character data is the genus Didelphis. By virtue of long acceptance this taxon has implicitly been assumed to be monophyletic, but no prior morphological study has tested generic monophyly. Instead, monophyly of Didelphis has previously been supported by analyses of cytochrome-b sequences (Patton et al., 1996) and by DNA-DNA hybridization results (Kirsch et al., 1997) . Although IRBP sequences do not resolve Didelphis as a clade, neither do they (or any other published data) provide support for any incongruent pattern of relationships (Jansa and Voss, 2000) . Therefore, monophyly of Didelphis is another noncontroversial result.",

Although results that are incongruent with some of these relationships have also been reported, none is compelling. For example, Reig et al. (1987) depicted Chironectes as the nearest extant sister group of Didelphis in their summary cladogram (op. cit.: fig. 68 ), but Philander and/or Lutreolina were actually found to be more closely related to Didelphis in most of their parsimony analyses. Likewise, DNA-DNA hybridization results showing Gracilinanus nested inside the genus Mar-mosops (see Kirsch and Palma, 1995; Kirsch et al., 1997) are now unambiguously attributable to taxonomic misidentifications. 12 Therefore, 10 out of the 20 resolved ingroup nodes in our nonmolecular strict consensus tree are both supported by independent analyses of other datasets and lack compelling contradictory evidence. The remaining 10 nodes, all weakly supported, are problematic because they are contradicted by other datasets, including the IRBP and combined analyses discussed below. Because only ad hoc explanations are possible for phylogenetic conflicts involving trivial character support, we do not discuss such problems here.",

Even in the absence of homoplasy, however, adding taxa scored for the same set of characters tends to decrease average nodal support because synapomorphies are subdivided among a larger number of internal branches (Horovitz, 1999) .

We borrowed the corresponding morphological voucher specimens (MSB 67020 and MSB 87094, respectively) and determined that they are examples of Marmosa ocellata Tate (1931) , a nominal taxon that is currently regarded as a junior synonym of Marmosops dorothea (Thomas, 1911) . These misidentifications explain the paradox remarked by Kirsch and Palma (1995: 414) that ''M. dorothea proved nearly indistinguishable from Gracilinanus agilis'' by thermal elution of scnDNA heteroduplexes. According to Kirsch and Palma (1995) , their specimens were identified using keys in Hershkovitz (1992b) , but the only key provided in that paper does not accurately diagnose Gracilinanus from Marmosops.",

However, some nodes that were not present in the nonmolecular consensus topology ( fig. 17 ) also exhibit higher support in the combined analysis than in the IRBP tree, including clade B, clade C, Marmosa mexicana \u03e9 M. robinsoni, and ''other Marmosa'' \u03e9 Micoureus.

On the basis of morphological comparisons, they rejected a close relationship of canescens with either the large 2n \u03ed 22 opossums or with Monodelphis (2n \u03ed 18), concluding that centric fissioning occurred independently in canescens. We agree that there is no compelling morphological evidence for a close relationship of canescens with other didelphids that have high diploid numbers. However, there NO. 276 BULLETIN AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY Results of Parsimony Analyses with Topological Constraints a is likewise no morphological evidence that canescens is closely related to Marmosa, which forms an unresolved mess at the base of the didelphine radiation in our nonmolecular consensus topology ( fig. 17) . Instead, there is strong molecular support for a clade that includes other species of Marmosa plus Micoureus ( fig. 18 ), leaving canescens to participate in any of several parsimonyequivalent sister-group relationships with Monodelphis and higher didelphines ( fig.  19 ). Essentially the same picture remains when the nonmolecular and IRBP data are combined ( fig. 21 ). Removing canescens from Marmosa would therefore serve to restrict the latter name to a well-supported monophyletic group (that might or might not include Micoureus; see below) and to emphasize the status of canescens as a unique lineage that merits representation in future phylogenetic studies. Because the Linnaean convention of binomial nomenclature requires that canescens be provided with a recipient genus, and because no generic name is currently available for that purpose, we provide one at the conclusion of this discussion (below).",

Three phylogenetically defensible alternative solutions to the current classification of these taxa merit consideration: (1) synonymizing Micoureus Lesson, 1842, with Marmosa Gray, 1821; (2) retaining Micou-reus as a valid subgenus of Marmosa, for which additional subgenera would then be required to contain species that are not closely related to murina (the type species of Marmosa); or (3) retaining Micoureus as a genus by restricting Marmosa to contain only murina and its demonstrably close relatives, and recognizing a separate genus (or genera) for the other species. The first alternative is the simplest, but has the disadvantage of discarding a useful name for the monophyletic group that is now known as Micoureus. The second and third alternatives require the adoption of new or unfamiliar names, the application of which is currently hard to justify because many species of Marmosa remain to be analyzed. Pine (1972) , for example, named the subgenus Stegomarmosa for Marmosa andersoni, but we have yet to obtain tissues from that species. The prudent course of action seems, therefore, to preserve the current generic taxonomy until future research has determined which of these arrangements is optimal. In the interim, it should be recognized that Marmosa is not demonstrably monophyletic, and that any biogeographic or comparative analysis based on generic membership may be suspect as a consequence.",

Based on morphological character data recently compiled for another project (Voss and D.P.

Rhinarium with two ventrolateral grooves; dark ocular mask present; supraocular spots absent; gular gland absent; dorsal fur unpatterned (unicolored grayish or reddish-gray), with short, inconspicuous guard hairs; manual digits III and IV subequal; large adult males with well-developed lateral carpal tubercles but not medial carpal tubercles; plantar surface of hind foot naked from heel to toes; pedal digit IV longer than other pedal digits; marsupium absent; tail essentially naked (without a conspicuously furred base), covered by epidermal scales in annular series except for distal prehensile surface, not incrassate. Rostral process of premaxillae absent; nasals conspicuously wider posteriorly than anteriorly; very large, flattened, wing-like postorbital processes present in mature adults; sagittal crest absent; parietal and alisphenoid in contact on lateral braincase; no lateral petrosal exposure through fenestra between parietal and squamosal; maxillopalatine fenestrae long (usually extending from the level of P3 to M3); palatine fenestrae absent; maxillary fenestrae present, often confluent with maxillopalatine openings; posterolateral palatal foramina posterior to M4 protocones; posterior palate with prominent lateral corners, the internal choanae constricted behind; transverse canal foramen present; secondary foramen ovale absent; ectotympanic suspension direct; fenestra cochleae exposed; paroccipital process of exoccipital small, rounded, adnate to posterior aspect of petrosal; dorsal margin of foramen magnum formed by supraocciptal and exoccipitals. Crowns of I2-I5 symmetrically rhomboidal and subequal (not increasing in size from front to back); P2 and P3 subequal in height; P3 without an anterior cutting edge; upper molars strongly dilambdodont; distinct ectoflexus present on M2 and M3 (much deeper on the latter tooth); anterior cingulum complete on M3. Distinct lingual cusp present on i1-i4; c1 an erect, dorsally recurved tooth (not procumbent and premolariform); p2 much taller than p3; dp3 with incomplete (bicuspid) trigonid; entoconid a tall sharp cusp, much higher than hypoconulid on m1, m2, and sometimes m3.",

Two additional comparisons also provide diagnostic criteria, but these were not coded for phylogenetic analysis due to morphological intermediates observed among other didelphine taxa. The first concerns the morphology of I2-I5, which have rhomboidal crowns that increase in breadth from front to back in Marmosa, such that I2 is visibly narrower than I5 in lateral view. The crowns of I2-I5 are also rhomboidal in Tlacuatzin, but in that taxon they do not increase in breadth from front to back, and the crowns of I2 and I5 appear subequal in lateral view. The second comparison involves the lower canine, which is a procumbent tooth with a flattened, blade-like apex and (occasionally) a small posterior accessory cusp in Marmosa. By contrast, c1 is an erect, simple, recurved-conical tooth in Tlacuatzin. Additional character-state differences (scored in appendix 5) distinguish Tlacuatzin canescens from Marmosa murina (the type species of Marmosa), but these are not consistently useful for generic diagnosis.",

Recent syntheses of distributional data have documented the impressive diversity of western Mexican dry forests, to which at least 25 mammalian species are endemic (Ceballos, 1995; Ceballos and Garc\u00eda, 1995; Ceballos et al., 1998) . A different fauna inhabits the dry tropical forests of the Yucatan Peninsula, however, where T. canescens also occurs. The Yucatecan dry forest fauna is less easily defined than that of western Mexico because dry forest on the Yucatan Peninsula grades into more mesic vegetation formations, but most Yucatecan endemics are primarily dry-forest species (e.g., Heteromys gaumeri, Otonyctomys hatti, Mazama pandora; see Reid, 1997; Medell\u00edn et al., 1998) .",

Specimens from the Bolivian highlands with darker brownish dorsal fur, graybased yellowish ventral fur, larger hind feet, smaller bullae, and maxillary palatal vacuities are here referred to T. venustus. Both species have smooth interorbital regions, with no trace of postorbital processes. Our identifications are consistent with the original descriptions of both taxa (Thomas, 1902) and with subsequent accounts based on first-hand examination of the BMNH holotypes (Tate, 1933; Flores et al., 2000) , but not necessarily with other published usages of these names.",

                "text": "Unpublished morphological and molecular data (Voss and Patton, in prep.) suggest that several distinct clades are represented within the geographically widespread complex of nominal taxa that have traditionally been regarded as subspecies or synonyms of M. murina (e.g., by Tate, 1933; Cabrera, 1958; Gardner, 1993) . Although the specimens we sequenced and scored for morphological characters are referable to M. murina of current usage, they appear to belong to an unnamed southwestern Amazonian taxon that is distinct from the nominotypical form of northeastern Amazonia. Marmosa murina is the type species of the genus Marmosa.4. Marmosa robinsoni: As currently recognized (e.g., by Gardner, 1993) , Marmosa robinsoni includes several readily diagnosable species whose distinguishing characteristics and geographic distributions were clearly explained by Tate (1933) . The material sequenced and examined for this report is referable to the taxon that Tate recognized as M. ruatanica isthmica, but we follow current usage pending a formal revision of the robinsoni group.5. Marmosops impavidus and M. noctivagus: Our identifications of these species are based on the diagnostic morphological characters defined and illustrated by Patton et al. (2000) , but we have not personally examined the type material of either taxon.6. Marmosops incanus: We apply this name in the restricted sense of Mustrangi and Patton (1997) , who revised the taxonomy of the southeastern Brazilian species of Marmosops and illustrated diagnostic cranial characters. In addition to the external characters already known to distinguish M. incanus from its sometimes-sympatric congener M. paulensis (op. cit: table 3), we observed differences in scrotal coloration (blue in incanus, white in paulensis) and carpal morphology (lateral tubercles are well developed in adult males of incanus but apparently not of paulensis) that also merit evaluation in future revisionary studies. Marmosops incanus is the type species of the genus Marmosops.7. Marmosops parvidens and M. pinheiroi: We use these names in the restricted sense of Voss et al. (2001) , who recognized several taxa formerly treated as subspecies of parvidens (sensu Pine, 1981) as full species and illustrated diagnostic character differences.8. Micoureus paraguayanus: We are using this name for the southeastern Brazilian taxon that Patton et al. (2000) identified as Micoureus limae, and that Patton and Costa (2003) subsequently identified as M. travassosi. Although we have not examined any relevant type material, the morphological voucher material in question (the same specimens previously sequenced by Patton and his colleagues) does not conform to published descriptions of either limae or travassosi. Whereas limae was described by Thomas (1920) and Tate (1933) as having brownish dorsal fur, a very long (ca. 35 mm) furred tail base, and hardly any white spotting near the tail tip, MVZ 182064 and 182065 have distinctly grayish dorsal pelage, shorter (ca. 25 mm) furry tail bases, and long white tail tips. Indeed, morphological comparisons (noted by Thomas, 1920) together with new sequence data (Patton and Costa, 2003) suggest that limae (with type locality in Cear\u00e1) is more closely allied with Amazonian forms of Micoureus than with southeastern Brazilian taxa.The identity of travassosi remains to be convincingly established. Unfortunately, the only published diagnosis of this taxon is in a key (Miranda-Ribeiro, 1936: 366) , which clearly states that the tail is shorter than the head-and-body but provides no other useful information. Because all known species of Micoureus have very long tails (e.g., those of MVZ 182064 and 182064 are ca. 137-145% of head-and-body length), it is not at all clear that the current generic allocation of this taxon is correct.Instead, paraguayanus appears to be the oldest available name for the grayish Micoureus with a conspicuously white-tipped tail that ranges from Pernambuco southward along the humid Brazilian Atlantic forest biome to eastern Paraguay. In fact, Tate's (1931) original description matches the material at hand almost perfectly. Although measurement data suggest that considerable size variation exists among referred populations of this taxon (Tate, 1933) , no other identification seems appropriate in the absence of a formal revisionary study. Micoureus cinereus (Temminck, 1824), the type species of Micoureus, is an older but technically invalid synonym (Gardner, 1993) . 9. Micoureus regina: We follow the currently accepted taxonomy (Gardner, 1993) in applying this name to the western Amazonian species for which diagnostic morphological characters were recently documented by Patton et al. (2000) . However, those authors correctly noted that the type locality of M. regina (in the Magdalena valley of interAndean Colombia) is difficult to reconcile with this usage, and that other names for western Amazonian taxa currently treated as synonyms or subspecies (e.g., germana or rutteri) are probably more appropriate.10. Monodelphis brevicaudata: We are using this name in the restricted sense of Voss et al. (2001) , who recognized M. glirina and M. palliolata (formerly regarded as synonyms or subspecies of M. brevicaudata; see Gardner, 1993) as distinct species.

                "text": "We evaluated but did not use many didelphid characters described in the systematic literature. Although some of these rejected characters are discussed in our text, a discursive evaluation of all of them would occupy too much space in this preliminary report. Instead, the following list briefly summarizes the principal difficulties that we encountered with omitted external and craniodental characters analyzed in previous studies of marsupial relationships.Body size (Kirsch and Archer, 1982: characters 46, 47; Reig et al., 1987: characters 25, 26) : alternative states (''small'' versus ''medium'' and ''large'') undefined, not distinct due to continuous taxonomic variation.Presence/absence of ''orbital crest'' (Wroe et al., 2000: character 45) : possibly synonymous with character 34 of this study, but homology uncertain.Presence/absence of accessory posterolateral palatine foramina (Wroe et al., 2000: character 49) : alternative conditions hard to recognize unambiguously; frequently polymorphic.Condition of ''alisphenoid hypotympanic sinus'' (Wroe et al., 2000: character 56) : unable to recognize alternative conditions coded in published data matrix from our material.Size of alisphenoid tympanic wing in relation to other bullar components (Kirsch and Archer, 1982: characters 27, 49, 50; Reig et al., 1987: characters 28, 29; Wroe et al., 2000 : character 57): alternative conditions (e.g., ''poorly developed'' versus ''well developed'') difficult to distinguish unambiguously among didelphids due to continuous range of intermediate morphologies.Presence/absence of squamosal epitympanic recess (Kirsch and Archer, 1982: character 25) : unable to replicate published taxonomic scoring from our material; apparently invariant (absent) among didelphids.Size/extent of rostral tympanic process of petrosal (Kirsch and Archer, 1982 : character 26; S\u00e1nchez-Villagra and Wible, 2002: character 7): alternative conditions (e.g., ''absent or tiny'' versus ''small'') undefined, or hard to score as unambiguous alternatives due to intermediate morphologies in this study.Position of hiatus fallopii (S\u00e1nchez-Villagra and Wible, 2002: character 12) : scoring requires specimen preparations (isolated petrosals) unavailable for most taxa in this study.Presence/absence of postemporal sulcus on squamosal surface of petrosal (S\u00e1nchez-Villagra and Wible, 2002: character 13) : scoring requires specimen preparations (isolated petrosals) unavailable for most taxa in this study.Presence/absence of notch or foramen at pos-terior end of postemporal sulcus (S\u00e1nchez-Villagra and Wible, 2002: character 14) : alternative states difficult to distinguish unambiguously; often polymorphic. Presence/absence of petrosal lip enclosing internal jugular vein ventrally (Wroe et al., 2000: character 61) : presence/absence hard to distinguish from intermediate morphologies.Morphology of tubal foramen (Wroe et al., 2000: character 70) : alternative conditions hard to distinguish due to intermediates.Hypsodonty of I1 (Takahashi, 1974; Archer, 1976b: character 2; Wroe et al., 2000: character 3): states not definable as unambiguous alternatives among didelphids.Presence/absence of diastema between I1 and I2 (Archer, 1976b : character 1): invariant among didelphids (see Creighton, 1984: character 40) .Upper incisor crowns ''spatulate'' versus nonspatulate (Archer, 1976b: character 3; Kirsch and Archer, 1982: characters 2, 43) : descriptors (e.g., ''spatulate'' versus ''normal'' or ''round'') undefined and unintelligible from taxonomic scoring in published matrices (see discussion under character 52).' 'Posterior [upper] incisors longer crowned than I2'' (Archer, 1976b: character 5) : morphological variation difficult to score as discrete states due to morphological intermediates in this study (see discussion under character 52).Relative size of upper canine (Archer, 1976b : character 6): states not definable as unambiguous alternatives among didelphids.Presence/absence of diastema between P1 and ''P3 '' [P2] (Archer, 1976b: character 16) : states not unambiguously distinguishable among didelphids.Shape of P2 and P3 (Kirsch and Archer, 1982: character 45) : states (''normal'' versus ''bulbous'') undefined, not recognizable as distinct alternatives due to continuous taxonomic variation; inconsistent with scoring in other studies using similar descriptors (see text account for our character 56).Presence/absence or completeness of P3 cingula (Archer, 1976b: characters 13, 14; Creighton, 1984: characters 45, 46) : states not unambiguously distinguishable among didelphids; often polymorphic.Continuity of posterior cutting edge of P4 with M1 parastyle (Archer, 1976b: character 12) : alternative conditions not unambiguously distinguishable.Presence/absence, relative size, and/or connections of stylar cusps (Archer, 1976b: character 29; Kirsch and Archer, 1982: characters 12, 33, 34; Creighton, 1984: characters 50-52; Reig et al., 1987: characters 6, 7, 8; Wroe et al., 2000: char-acter 19) : putative cusp homologies (especially regarding those in C and D positions) uncertain; alternative states (especially with respect to paracrista connections to cusps A versus B) not unambiguously distinguishable, as evidenced by discrepant scoring of same taxa in different studies and/or our inability to replicate published observations.Proportion of upper molar width to ectoloph length (Archer, 1976b: character 21) : laborious to quantify; visual scoring impossible due to apparently continuous taxonomic variation.Relative lengths of M2 and M3 (Kirsch and Archer, 1982: character 30; Reig et al., 1987: character 3): alternative conditions impossible to distinguish as unambiguous alternatives due to continuous taxonomic variation.Relative sizes and proximity of paracones and metacones on M1-M3 (Archer, 1976b: characters 23, 26; Kirsch and Archer, 1982: characters 9, 10, 32; Creighton, 1984: character 48; Reig et al., 1987: character 5; Wroe et al., 2000: character 8) : alternative states not unambiguously distinguishable due to continuous taxonomic variation; partially redundant as correlates of carnassialization (see our character 57); unable to replicate taxonomic scoring in some published data matrices.Presence/absence/size of M4 metacone and correlated shape and size of tooth (Archer, 1976b: character 20; Kirsch and Archer, 1982: characters 7, 37; Reig et al., 1987: characters 11, 12; Wroe et al., 2000: character 9) : difficult to distinguish alternative states among taxa scored for this study; correlated with carnassialization.Shape of M3 (Kirsch and Archer, 1982: character 31; Reig et al., 1987: character 4) : alternative states (based on ratio of ''outer border'' to ''anterior border'') not distinguishable as discrete alternatives due to continuous variation.Presence/absence of protoconules and metaconules (Archer, 1976b: character 26; Kirsch and Archer, 1982: character 29; Reig et al., 1987: character 2; Wroe et al., 2000: characters 14, 15) : unable to replicate published taxonomic scoring from our material; inconsistent scoring of same taxa in different published matrices; presence/absence hard to distinguish from various intermediate conditions (conules not consistently distinct in any didelphid examined).Size of M3 protocone (Kirsch and Archer, 1982: character 11) : alternative conditions (''unreduced'' versus ''reduced'') undefined, hard to recognize unambiguously.Shape of protocones (Kirsch and Archer, 1982: character 36; Reig et al., 1987: character 10) : alternative conditions (''bulbous'' versus ''moderately'' or ''highly compressed'') hard to distinguish as distinct alternatives.Relative length metacristae of M1-M3 (Archer, 1976b: character 27; Creighton, 1984: character 49) : taxonomic variation continuous, not recognizable as distinct alternative conditions among didelphids; redundant correlate of carnassialization (see our character 57).Relative lengths of metacrista and postparacrista (Kirsch and Archer, 1982: character 35; Reig et al., 1987: character 9) : taxonomic variation continuous, not divisible into unambiguously alternative states.Orientation of m1-m3 ''metacristids'' [\u03ed protocristids] (Archer, 1976b: character 39; Creighton, 1984: character 57) : alternative states (''oblique'' versus ''transverse'' to long axis of toothrow) not unambiguously distinguishable.Shape of m3 metaconid (Kirsh and Archer, 1982: character 16): shape descriptors (''transverse'' versus ''not transverse'') problematic, not decipherable from published taxonomic scoring (unless ''metaconid'' lapsus for ''metacristid''; see preceding character).Relative height/size of metaconid and paraconid (Archer, 1976b: character 38; Kirsch and Archer, 1982: character 41; Reig et al., 1987: character 17) : unable to replicate published taxonomic scoring from our material; invariant among didelphids (unworn metaconid always higher/larger than paraconid).Relative size/height protoconid and paraconid (Kirsch and Archer, 1982: character 42; Reig et al., 1987: character 18) : states not well defined, not recognizable as distinct alternatives due to continuous taxonomic variation; unable to replicate published taxonomic scoring from our material.Relative lengths trigonid and talonid (Kirsch and Archer, 1982: character 39; Reig et al., 1987: character 15) : taxonomic variation continuous, not divisible into unambiguously alternative states.Number of cusps on m4 talonid (Archer, 1976b: character 35; Kirsch and Archer, 1982: character 19; Creighton, 1984: character 56; Wroe et al., 2000: character 44) : alternative states not unambiguously distinguishable (presence/absence/indistinctness of very small cusps hard to score); polymorphic in most taxa with narrow (laterally compressed) talonids.Size of m3 talonid (Kirsch and Archer, 1982: character 20) : alternative states (''normal'' versus ''reduced'') undefined, not unambiguously distinguishable in our material.Size/shape of m4 talonid (Kirsch and Archer, 1982: character 40; Reig et al., 1987: character 16) : taxonomic variation continuous, not divisible into unambiguous alternative states.Shape of m2-m4 talonids (Reig et al., 1987: character 13) : states (defined in terms of ratio of talonid width to talonid length) not distinguishable as distinct alternatives due to continuous taxonomic variation.Relative size/shape of m3 and m4 (Kirsch and Archer, 1982: character 38; Reig et al., 1987: character 14; Wroe et al., 2000: character 42) : unable to replicate taxonomic scoring in published data matrices from our material; alternative conditions not unambiguously distinguishable.Completeness/size of labial cingula on lower molars (Archer, 1976b: character 41; Reig et al., 1987: character 19; Wroe et al., 2000: character 36) : alternative conditions not unambiguously distinguishable.",
