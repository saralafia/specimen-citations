    "abstract": "Behavioural isolation may lead to complete speciation when partial postzygotic isolation acts in the presence of divergent-specific mate-recognition systems. These conditions exist where Mus musculus musculus and M. m. domesticus come into contact and hybridize. We studied two mate-recognition signal systems, based on urinary and salivary proteins, across a Central European portion of the mouse hybrid zone. Introgression of the genomic regions responsible for these signals: the major urinary proteins (MUPs) and androgen binding proteins (ABPs), respectively, was compared to introgression at loci assumed to be nearly neutral and those under selection against hybridization. The preference of individuals taken from across the zone regarding these signals was measured in Y mazes, and we develop a model for the analysis of the transition of such traits under reinforcement selection. The strongest assortative preferences were found in males for urine and females for ABP. Clinal analyses confirm nearly neutral introgression of an Abp locus and two loci closely linked to the Abp gene cluster, whereas two markers flanking the Mup gene region reveal unexpected introgression. Geographic change in the preference traits matches our reinforcement selection model significantly better than standard cline models. Our study confirms that behavioural barriers are important components of reproductive isolation between the house mouse subspecies.",

                "text": "According to the Biological Species Concept (Dobzhansky 1937; Mayr 1942) , speciation, i.e. a process leading to evolution of separate species, requires the develop-ment of reproductive barriers between gene pools. Assortative mating is a potentially efficient prezygotic reproductive barrier and may thus prevent loss of genes into unfit hybrids (Lande 1981; Butlin 1995; Wells & Henry 1998; Panhuis et al. 2001; Turelli et al. 2001; Ptacek 2002; Coyne & Orr 2004; Ritchie 2007) . When partial postzygotic isolation acts in the presence of divergent-specific mate-recognition systems, selection for increased mating specificity may lead to complete speciation (Dobzhansky 1940; Howard 1993; Servedio & Noor 2003; Coyne & Orr 2004) . This phenomenon can best be studied in closely related or recently divergent taxa where limited hybridization still occurs and speciation may be incipient. Here, selection may act to reinforce prezygotic isolation in regions of secondary contact, leading to avoidance of disadvantageous mating between genetically diverged taxa (Dobzhansky 1940; Butlin 1987 Butlin , 1995 Howard 1993; Kirkpatrick & Ravign\u00e9 2002; Marshall et al. 2002; Servedio & Noor 2003; Servedio 2004; Hoskin et al. 2005; Smadja & Butlin 2006) .",

The width of this hybrid zone may vary for different markers (see Teeter et al. 2010; Machol\u00e1n et al. 2011; and references therein) , but usually it is more than a factor of ten wider than the per generation dispersal of individual mice. Virtually no F 1 hybrids are found within the zone, and the locality samples in the centre consist of a complex mixture of late-generation hybrids and backcrosses. Both sexes contribute equally to hybridization, and for most markers, zone structure is unimodal with predominating intermediate genotypes in the centre, characterized by the lowest fitness (Raufaste et al. 2005; Machol\u00e1n et al. 2007) .",

As olfactory cues represent the primary means of communication in nocturnal animals such as the house mouse (Beauchamp & Yamazaki 2003; Brennan & Kendrick 2006) , diverged chemosignals and their receptors should be ideal candidates for premating isolation barriers.",

                "text": "Two candidate-specific mate-recognition systems have been proposed as behavioural barriers acting in the house mouse hybrid zone: one based on urinary cues (Smadja & Ganem 2002 Smadja et al. 2004; Ganem et al. 2008) , including possibly the major urinary proteins (MUPs; Cheetham et al. 2007; Stopkov\u00e1 et al. 2007; Thom et al. 2008) , the other based on saliva cues encoded by genes of the androgen-binding protein (Abp) family (Karn & Dlouhy 1991; Laukaitis et al. 1997; Talley et al. 2001) . A rigorous analysis of the potential roles of these systems in modulating house mouse interactions requires consideration of both parts of each mate-recognition system (the signal and the associated preference) across the geographic context of the hybrid zone, a situation requiring some modification of existing clinal models. Haldane (1948) introduced the theory of a cline, i.e. a smooth change in the expectation of traits with geographic distance, to the neo-Darwinian synthesis. Clines of similar smooth sigmoid shape can be maintained by environmental (extrinsic) selection for different optima or intrinsic selection against admixture (Kruuk et al. 1999) . This shape is modified when selection acts on multiple loci because dispersal leads to strong associations across loci where clinal change is rapid and these associations mean the effective selection on each locus is greater than if they were independent. The result is clines with steepened central portions or 'stepped' clines (Szymura & Barton 1986 Barton & Gale 1993; Baird 1995; Kruuk et al. 1999) . These models of clinal change apply equally to frequencies of alleles and measures of quantitative traits (Barton & Gale 1993) , and a number of clines in quantitative traits have been analysed, e.g. in toads (N\u00fc rnberger et al. 1995) , grasshoppers (Bridle et al. 2001; Bridle & Butlin 2002) , ground beetles (Takami & Suzuki 2005) , butterflies (Blum 2008) , sea gulls (Gay et al. 2008) , and house mice (O. Mikula & M. Machol\u00e1n, unpublished data) .",

If two taxa prefer cues originating from their own rather than the other taxon, then a simple expectation is that cue preference will change from one extreme to the other across the zone, passing through a point of nopreference where hybridization has produced individuals that identify with neither pure taxon (e.g. grasshoppers: Butlin & Hewitt 1985a,b; Butlin & Ritchie 1991; or mice: Ganem et al. 2008) . However, the phenomenon of reinforcement (i.e. the strengthening of postzygotic isolation as a result of emergence of prezygotic barriers; Coyne & Orr 2004) would modify this simple cline expectation, and in a manner quite different from the stepped cline effect arising from multilocus associations. This is because we expect reinforcement to modify behaviour most where the consequences of choice can lead to unfit descendants. If hybrids are less fit, rein-forcement should then amplify consubspecific preference most close to a contact zone resulting in increased prezygotic isolation in sympatry relative to allopatry, a phenomenon called reproductive character displacement (Butlin 1995; Lemmon et al. 2004 ).",

Butlin & Ritchie (1991) noted such a modification, and as well as fitting a sigmoid cline to their data they fitted a polynomial curve in order to better capture this unusual shape. Here, we develop an explicit model of the effects of reinforcement on a preference trait cline. An explicit model has the advantage that we can directly compare the likelihood of our observations when different levels of reinforcement are allowed. Moreover, testing for the effects of reinforcement using comparison of nested explicit hypotheses is much more straightforward to interpret in a biologically meaningful way than comparing clines and polynomial curves, because clines are described in terms of their centre and width, while these are not explicitly part of a polynomial curve parameterization.",

                "text": "In this study, our goal was to understand the contributions of mate-choice preference based on both salivary and urinary signals to the maintenance of the European mouse hybrid zone. We analysed both parts of these recognition systems, i.e. diverged signals and associated preferences, in two candidate subspecies-specific systems, in contrast to other studies that evaluated either only preference (Smadja & Ganem 2002 Smadja et al. 2004; B\u00edmov\u00e1 et al. 2005; Ganem et al. 2008) or only signal genotypes (Dod et al. 2005) . We asked how behavioural isolation contributes to the dynamics of the mouse hybrid zone. Specifically, we predicted that: (i) If the signals contribute to isolation, they must be diverged between the two subspecies and genes encoding the signals should have more limited introgression across the hybrid zone than neutral genes and (ii) If the associated preferences are to contribute to isolation then we should find assortative mating on both sides of the hybrid zone and we would expect to see reproductive character displacement in the hybrid zone, in terms of enhanced preferences, as predicted by the theory of reinforcement. We analysed clines for sexual preferences measured using simple two-way choice tests for urinary signals and androgen binding protein (ABP) signals. We also compared the introgression of molecular markers on chromosome 4 (Mup region) and chromosome 7 (Abp region) with loci assumed to be under strong selection and those assumed to be selec-tively neutral or nearly neutral with respect to the hybrid zone.",

No Mup has been evidenced to be diagnostic of the M. musculus subspecies. As a proxy for these genes, we analysed two SNPs flanking the Mup region on Chromosome 4: 4.59941702 (hereinafter abbreviated as 4.060; N = 1477), which maps 137 640 bp proximally of the Mup gene cluster, and 4.62782738 (4.063; N = 1482), which is located 1 286 471 bp distal to it. Both markers were selected from a high-density genotyping array (Yang et al. 2009) and show fixed differences between M. m. musculus and M. m. domesticus mice sampled from across their ranges (L. Wang et al., in preparation). For both markers, a subset of mice were genotyped using the Illumina \u00d2 Goldengate \u00d2 Assay on an Illumina \u00d2 Beadstation 500 at the University of Michigan Genotyping Core and the remaining samples were genotyped using the TaqMan protocol. In addition, we analysed diagnostic loci on the same chromosomes, located at various distances from the Abp and Mup regions. On Chromosome 7, two B2 SINE retroelements and one U2 element were scored. Both B2 markers (7B2-3720, hereinafter referred to as 3720; N = 1769; and 7B2-3746, hereinafter 3746; N = 1798) map very close to the proximal side of the Abp region, whereas the U2 element (7U2_318M16, hereinafter referred to as 318M16; N = 1853) maps about halfway between the centromere and the Abp region ( Fig. 2a ). On Chromosome 4, we scored one SNP, 4.057 (N = 1426; Teeter et al. 2008) , 2.4 Mb proximal to the Mup gene cluster, one B2 SINE element, 4B2_141I14 (141I14; N = 2313), and one allozyme locus, hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6pd, E.C. 1.1.1.47; N = 2007), both located distally to the Mup genes ( Fig. 2b) . A brief description of each marker, its position, the primer sequences and PCR conditions are given in Table S3 (Supporting information). Genetic map positions were retrieved from the current mouse Fig. 1 The Czech-Bavarian transect across the Mus musculus musculus \u2044 M. m. domesticus hybrid zone in Europe with positions of collecting sites depicted. Black dots indicate sampling sites from which only molecular data are available whereas diamonds show localities sampled also for behavioural analyses; dark and light colours refer to individuals subjected to tests using ABP and urinary cues, respectively.

Because of the demic structure of mouse populations, with a single dominant male siring most of the offspring, estimates of allele frequency across localities were weighted by taking into account potential non-independence of observations of alleles because of relatedness and deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. This weighting is expressed as the effective number of alleles sampled (N e ) following the procedure described in detail in Machol\u00e1n et al. (2008) . The likelihood of observing a particular allele frequency at a locality was calculated using a modified binomial distribution (Edwards 1992) parameterized by N e . Geographic coordinates of sampling sites were gnomonically projected onto the plane using a routine written in Mathematica (Wolfram 1992 ) by one of the authors (SJEB). Subsequently, the two-dimensional transect was collapsed onto a line parallel to the most likely direction of change in allele frequencies, estimated in Machol\u00e1n et al.

First consider expectations for the hybrid index h, scaled from 0 (pure individuals of one taxon) to 1 (pure individuals of the other taxon). We follow a common wisdom that the house mouse hybrid zone is maintained by the balance between dispersal and selection against hybrids, i.e. it is a 'tension zone' (Key 1968) . A simple tension zone expectation is that h will change as the sigmoid function h(y) = [Tanh(2y) + 1] \u2044 2 (Bazykin 1969; Nagylaki 1975; Slatkin 1975; Barton & Gale 1993) . The gradient of change is then h\u00a2(y) = Sech(2y) 2 , i.e. it is steepest at the centre, achieving a maximum value of unit width (equivalently, the width of a cline is defined as the gradient at the centre). Now consider the current study's preference measure (see behaviour data above). In the case of complete assortative mating of pure individuals, this trait will change from )1 at one extreme to +1 at the other. Between these extremes, if preference for a cue is proportional to an individual's similarity to individuals at the cue's source (where similarity is measured using hybrid indices), then the expectation for the trait will follow the sigmoid cline running from )1 to +1, Tanh(y). More generally, individuals may not show such extreme ()1,+1) levels of preference. If preference instead varies between p 0 and p 1, the trait will follow the cline p(y, p 0 , p 1 ) = p 0 + Tanh(yDp )1 ) Dp, where Dp is the difference in preference levels across the zone,",

However, both these effects are negligible for the cases we consider: preferences never exceed ()1,+1) and the maximum shift in y = 0 is <5% of the underlying cline width. It should be emphasized that this model is an oversimplification of reality: if preference is amplified and heritable, the genes encoding the preference will themselves diffuse, changing the expected form of the soliton. Those moving across the hybrid zone will be counter selected. Those moving away from the hybrid zone will arrive in areas where the consequences of poor choosiness are reduced. While these considerations are worthy of further exploration, for current purposes we believe the simple soliton-like expectation developed earlier is sufficient as an alternative model to be compared with standard cline expectations.",

Any differences in cline width between a27 and the other three Chromosome 7 loci were nonsignificant, including 318M16 (Table 1, Fig. 2 ). Of the three SNP markers flanking the Mup region, 4.060 (0.14 Mb proximal) reveals a cline similar to a27 whereas the sigmoid cline for 4.063 (1.3 Mb distal) is non-significantly broader and shifted westwards relative to both the loci (Table 1) . Though there is considerable introgression on both sides for 4.063, introgression of musculus alleles into the domesticus territory is stronger than the opposite process ( Fig. 3c) , making the cline almost significantly asymmetric ( Table 1) . The third locus, 4.057, mapping 2.4 Mb away from the Mup region, shows a steep transition on the domesticus side, whereas there is no apparent decline of the domesticus allele frequency on the musculus side (Fig. 3a) . This causes both the sigmoid and symmetrical stepped cline models to have extremely high width estimates with centre estimates substantially shifted towards the musculus range (Table 1, Fig. 2b ). The proximal cause of these effects is confirmed by comparison with estimates allowing for asymmetry: the Astep model produces 'normal' width and centre estimates with poor explicative power on the musculus side. Because of the problems presented by their clines, the 4.057 and 4.063 loci were excluded from tests of coincidence and concordance. The remaining two loci (141I14 and H6pd) on this Table 1 Maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) of cline shape parameters for 10 analysed loci: c = centre; w = width; LL = log-likelihood. Two-unit support limits of MLE for each parameter are given in parentheses. The parameters were estimated for three models: sigmoid (Sig), symmetrical stepped (Sstep) and asymmetrical stepped (Astep), and the best-fit model is indicated with asterisk chromosome did not yield unusual cline parameter estimates (Table 1, Fig. 2b ). By contrast to the clines for a27, 4.060 and the others, clines for the X-chromosome loci are significantly narrower than all autosomal loci tested.",

Our null hypothesis that the direction of preference varies randomly within the same sex and cue, i.e. that the underlying ratio of consubspecific preferences (domesticus-oriented west of the zone centre and musculus-oriented east of the zone centre) to heterosubspecific preferences is parity. We tested this null hypothesis with a Chi-square test.

If there is no reinforcement (R con-strained at 1), cline width estimates were not robust to details of the model (this may be seen as an indication that the nonreinforcement models in general were poor), while reinforcement (R > 1) was strongly supported over all scenarios considered. The MLE strength of reinforcement, R, and width of preference trait clines were robust to model details: reinforcement steepens preference clines by a factor of 2-3, making them between 25 and 30 km wide.

The two markers mapping the proximal end of the Abp region and located more than 3 Mb from a27 (3720, 3746) revealed clines wider by more than 5 km (Table 1, Fig. 2 ) than a27. Although this difference was not significant, it is consistent with the notion that they map further from the region where selection is acting. On the other hand, the clines for the 318M16 U2 element, mapping c. 15 Mb from the Abp region, were substantially narrower than the remaining loci on Chromosome 7, probably reflecting increased incompatibilities of pericentromeric chromosomal regions within the hybrid zone, as suggested by Fel-Clair et al. (1996) based on data from Denmark (see also results of Tucker et al. 1992 ; from southern Germany). However, neither of these markers revealed clines concordant with Pola1, i.e. the X-chromosome locus that has been shown to be under strong selection against hybridization (Payseur et al. 2004; Teeter et al. 2010; Dufkov\u00e1 et al. 2011; Machol\u00e1n et al. 2011) , nor with another two X-linked loci analysed, Fmr1 and Btk.",

                "text": "The results of a large-scale study of Karn et al. (2002) showing limited secondary admixture between house mouse subspecies suggested that the evolution of Abpa was more complex than previously thought (Karn & Dlouhy 1991; Laukaitis et al. 1997) . In fact, it is possible that the positive selection acting on a27 reported by Karn & Nachman (1999) and Karn et al. (2002) was actually affecting the closely linked Abpbg26 and Ab-pbg27 genes, because they also have sites that differ in representatives of the three subspecies of M. m. musculus (Karn & Laukaitis 2003) . Indeed, Emes et al. (2004) showed that the Abpbg subunits have more sites under selection than the Abpa subunits. Androgen-binding proteins function as dimers consisting of an alpha and beta (now beta-gamma) subunit, encoded by one of 30 Table 2 Parameters of hypothesis H 2 with reinforcement; w and wR are in kilometres, c is expressed as westward displacement in kilometres of the male ABP preference cline from the consensus cline (see text for details); in the last row, the asymmetry of the male urine preference cline is given as the absolute value of the ratio p 0 \u2044 p 1 ; in parentheses are 2-unit MLE support bounds Abpa paralogues and one of 34 Abpbg paralogues, respectively, found in a rapidly evolving region of the mouse genome (Laukaitis et al. 2008; Karn & Laukaitis 2009) and their relative roles as olfactory signals are yet to be unravelled. In any event, all the evidence available strongly suggests that it is ABP that is acting as the pheromonal signal, as there are amino acid residues under selection in both subunits, and in the dimeric combination, these sites all map to one face of the dimer (Emes et al. 2004) . Consequently, we suggest that the analysis of introgression patterns across the European hybrid zone should be extended to other Abp loci. The situation around the Mup cluster appears even more complex. The marker closest to this region, 4.060 (0.14 Mb proximal), revealed a cline similar to most autosomal loci, whereas the other flanking locus, 4.063 (1.29 Mb distal), appeared slightly more introgressed (Fig. 3c) to the domesticus side, rendering the sigmoid cline almost 35 km wide and shifted about 5 km westwards. Interestingly, this introgression appears to be localised to the area of massive introgression of musculus Y chromosome and some X-linked loci into the domesticus territory described by Machol\u00e1n et al. (2008 Machol\u00e1n et al. ( , 2011 ; both stepped models rendered clines similar to 4.060.",

This pattern was first described by Teeter et al. (2008) from southern Germany who suggested it was because of strong positive selection acting on Mup genes. If so, this introgression would span hundreds of kilometres beyond the zone because domesticus alleles are also found in considerable frequencies in southern Moravia (Czech Republic), Poland, Hungary, and as far to the east as in Kharkov in eastern Ukraine, i.e. more than 1700 km from the zone centre (Table S2 , in Supporting information). However, there are alternative explanations, namely ancestral polymorphism in M. m. musculus because of incomplete lineage sorting or balancing selection, or a westward movement of the zone, the latter scenario being corroborated by introgression patterns at other loci (Machol\u00e1n et al. 2011) .",

Despite this heterogeneity, preference clines were in general symmetrical and coincident, the exceptions being the 'male-ABP' cline (i.e. the cline for male preference of the ABP signal) which was found to be significantly shifted into the domesticus territory and the 'male-urine' cline (i.e. the cline for male preference of urine) with a higher level of consubspecific preference in M. m. domesticus males (Fig. 4 ). If the westward shift of the 'male-ABP' cline is a genuine reflection of the state of the hybrid zone, this pattern suggests a stronger preference of hybrids for the musculus signal in the hybrid zone where both a27 alleles are present (B\u00edmov\u00e1 et al. 2005) . Similar musculus-biased preferences were revealed for urinary stimuli in F 1 hybrids by Christophe & Baudoin (1998) ; however, we did not find any significant prevalence of preferences for musculus urinary signals on the domesticus side of the zone. If speciesspecific preference is a result of a self-referencing system (Todrank et al. 2005) , we should expect a similar shift also in associated signals. However, we found no significant cline shift of a27 relative to all analysed allozyme and X-chromosome markers.",

Thus, even though during experiments using Y-maze and saliva spots tested animals are also in close contact with the signal, the tests may be too conservative and their results should be considered to be a lower bound to 'true' preferences. In contrast, preferences for urinary stimuli are less likely to be affected by the test design, as these cues are naturally used as long-lasting scent marks (Beynon et al. 2001; Hurst & Beynon 2004; B\u00edmov\u00e1 et al. 2009) .",

However, for any protein to constitute a subspecies recognisable and discrimination mechanism, it must possess a molecule, or a combination of molecules consistently similar among members of either subspecies but significantly different between the two subspecies to be recognisable. In the case of MUPs, there has been speculation that their subspecies specificity can be attributed to expression and concentration differences rather than to differences in individual specific isoforms (Robertson et al. 2007; Stopka et al. 2007; Stopkov\u00e1 et al. 2007; Hurst 2009; Janotov\u00e1 & Stopka 2009) .

The salivas we used were from mice congenic for the C3H strain background and selected to differ only in a 12 \u00b1 8 cM region centred on the a27 gene (Laukaitis et al. 1997) . Therefore, the signal must be a salivary protein from a gene in that region. Putative pheromone genes that map to other chromosomes, such as Mups (Chromosome 4) and Esps (Chromosome 17), can be ruled out because they are identical in the congenic strains from which the saliva targets were collected. Furthermore, of all the genes mapping on Chromosome 7 in the 12 \u00b1 8 cM region transferred onto the C3H background, only the a27, bg26 and bg27 gene products, originally described as the alpha, beta and gamma subunits secreted into saliva (Dlouhy & Karn 1983; Karn & Laukaitis 2003) , were found in a recent saliva proteome study. In that work, triplicate saliva samples from both males and females were analysed by multi-dimensional protein identification technology (R. C. Karn and C. M. Laukaitis, unpublished data) , and the findings are consistent with Abp gene expression studies that reported a27, bg26 and bg27 transcripts in the parotid, submandibular and submaxillary glands of house mice (Laukaitis et al. 2005 ; paralogs renumbered as per Laukaitis et al. 2008) .",

This seems to be at odds with the notion that females are the sex with higher reproductive costs and hence choosier than males (Darwin 1871; Fisher 1930; Trivers 1972; Andersson 1994) . The weaker female preferences could be explained by variation in sexual receptivity as suggested by Ganem et al. (2008) ; however, we have not observed any differences in preference between receptive and nonreceptive females during our experiments (see also B\u00edmov\u00e1 et al. 2005 B\u00edmov\u00e1 et al. , 2009 ). An alternative hypothesis may point to differences in mating strategy between the sexes. Mice live in relatively closed demes so that females mate almost exclusively with a single dominant male during the most fertile period of the oestrous cycle and more than 70% of pups are thus sired by him (Bronson 1979; Drickamer et al. 2000; Dean et al. 2006) . Females probably do not have enough opportunities to engage in mate choice, and thus, selection on assortative mating acts more strongly on males as the more dispersing sex (Gerlach 1996 (Gerlach , 1998 . On the other hand, absence of assortative female preference based on urine stimuli may not mean that females do not choose whatsoever. Rather, females may only engage in mate-quality recognition. The value of urine scents for species recognition is less useful, as the probability of meeting a hetero(sub)specific male may be low even in cases where the deme structure is disrupted. A factor favouring male choosiness is the need to save sperm, given the polygynous mating system of the species. The sperm-allocation strategy (Dewsbury 1982; Parker 1984 ) may be further strengthened from the danger of wasting valuable sperm in hetero(sub)specific matings. The slightly stronger female preferences based on salivary ABPs relative to males found in this study could then be ascribed to the need for assessing both individual quality and (sub)specific status of subordinate males. As leaving extensive scent marks would be detrimental for these 'sneaking' males, ABPs, being effective in close inter-individual contacts, could be an efficient cue for the females.",

Not only do all types of barrier attract each other, they interact to steepen each other, producing stepped clines (Barton & Bengtsson 1986; Barton & Gale 1993) . It seems clear then that examining the potential action of reinforcement in increasing (prezygotic) barrier strength is an integral part of any understanding of a secondary contact. For us, the interest in exploring whether reinforcement is acting in the mouse hybrid zone is not about whether it will lead to speciation. Rather, we are interested in what proportion of the sharp and consistent barrier between mouse gene pools might come about through amplification of consubspecific preferences. We would argue that the interaction of barriers means any attempt to interpret, for example, postzygotic barrier strength independently of other potential barriers is flawed.",

The reinforcement parameter allows us to explore whether there is amplification of consubspecific preferences in areas where different genetic backgrounds meet. If hybrids are unfit, such amplification is predicted by reinforcement theory (Dobzhansky 1937; Howard 1993; Butlin 1995; Servedio & Noor 2003) . We present direct evidence that amplification is a better explanation than no amplification when describing preferences in the central portion of our hybrid zone transect. Smadja & Ganem (2005 , 2008 previously demonstrated that both urinary cues and associated preferences are more diverged in populations closer to the contact zone than in allopatric populations, suggesting a pattern similar to reproductive character displacement, and a similar observation has been made with respect to ABP (B\u00edmov\u00e1 et al. 2005) . This pattern is commonly considered as an evolutionary signature of reinforcement shaping premating isolation (Coyne & Orr 2004) ; however, it has been pointed out that other processes can give rise to similar observations and that reproductive character displacement may not be used as sole proof of reinforcement (Butlin 1995; Lemmon et al. 2004) . For example, Albert & Schluter (2004) show that direct selection may be more effective than reinforcement in establishing reproductive barrier between limnetic and benthic sticklebacks, suggesting necessity of controlling for the effects of ecological character displacement and adaptation to different niches on mate preferences. However, we believe that the direct nature of our measurements of preference amplification in situ in the hybrid zone severely reduces the number of alternative processes than might explain the observations. Moreover, house mice are human commensals, and at least in Central Europe, there are no differences in ecology between the two mouse taxa.",
