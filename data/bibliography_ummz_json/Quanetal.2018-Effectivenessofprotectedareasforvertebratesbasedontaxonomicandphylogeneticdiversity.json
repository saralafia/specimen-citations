Sin embargo, la efectividad de las\u00e1reas protegidas que se enfocan en especies determinadas ha sido cuestionada durante alg\u00fan tiempo, pues enfocarse en especies clave para la conservaci\u00f3n puede perjudicar al pool regional\u00edntegro de diversidad de especies y rara vez se consideran la diversidad filogen\u00e9tica y funcional. Evaluamos la efectividad de las\u00e1reas protegidas en China para la conservaci\u00f3n de la diversidad filogen\u00e9tica con base en la extensi\u00f3n y la filogenia de 2279 vertebrados terrestres. La diversidad filogen\u00e9tica y la taxon\u00f3mica estuvieron considerablemente correlacionadas, y s\u00f3lo 12.1 -43.8% de las\u00e1reas de conservaci\u00f3n prioritarias est\u00e1n protegidas actualmente. Independientemente de esto, los patrones y coberturas de la diversidad filogen\u00e9tica se vieron afectados cuando se sopesaron con la riqueza de especies. Estos resultados indicaron que en China las\u00e1reas protegidas que se enfocan en la riqueza alta de especies protegen bien a la diversidad filogen\u00e9tica en general pero fallaron en hacerlo en algunas regiones con comunidades m\u00e1s\u00fanicas o amenazadas (p. ej.: las\u00e1reas costeras del este de China, en donde las comunidades de aves bajo amenaza severa est\u00e1n menos protegidas). Nuestros resultados sugieren que la distribuci\u00f3n actual de\u00e1reas protegidas podr\u00eda mejorarse, aunque la mayor\u00eda de las\u00e1reas protegidas protegen tanto a la diversidad taxon\u00f3mica como a la filogen\u00e9tica.",

                "text": "The current use of biotic resources and rates of environmental disruption, as reported by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2005) , has accelerated the loss of biodiversity, and this loss will eventually threaten the sustainability of human society. In response, many biodiversity conservation actions have been undertaken. Among these, establishment of protected areas (PAs) is probably most effective in protecting local and regional biodiversity (Rodrigues et al. 2004a; Chape et al. 2005) . By setting up areas free from serious human disturbance, PA systems aim to maintain habitats for species that require in situ or ex situ conservation, protect coexisting organisms, and maintain the original landscape. Designers of PAs try to ensure that biodiversity is well protected at all levels, including gene, species, phylogeny, and function. Current PA systems are designed to achieve these goals by protecting areas containing threatened species and fragile areas of ecological importance. Their locations, however, tend to be based primarily on taxonomic diversity, and designers seldom consider phylogenetic and functional diversity. In many cases, protocols to locate PAs are taxon based. That is, they focus, for example, on richness of targeted taxa and the presence of rare and threatened species. The Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), for example, have collected millions of species records and have data on their distribution ranges, threat status, and other information that is required to inform these protocols. Most of the species-based protocols treat different taxa as equal entities, ignoring species' unique evolutionary status and functional traits (Faith 1992; HewettEmmett & Tashian 1996) . However, it is a species' evolutionary potential and intrinsic ecological value that matters for sustaining stable ecosystems. Species-based approaches tend to underrepresent rare and genetically distinct species and overrepresent widespread species (Brooks et al. 2006) . Under global climate change, the loss of phylogenetic diversity will induce the loss of future evolutionary options (Barker 2002) and alter species' interactions, which will eventually change the functioning and services of an ecosystem (Devictor et al. 2010) . Therefore, the call to consider evolutionary history and ecological functions in conservation planning is growing.",

The PD of sites, communities, and regions has been accumulated by recording the evolutionary signals of species, and these signals have been weighted based on the number of descendants from the same ancestor, abundance, or range or threat status to prioritize areas that provide the greatest conservation benefits (Cadotte & Davies 2016) . Phylogenetic relationships indicate phenotypic and ecological similarities, such that PD could be a measure of evolutionary history as well as an approximation of FD (Faith 2013) (but see Devictor et al. [2010] and Kelly et al. [2014] ). A criticism is that PD has a strong positive correlation with species richness, such that PD is not necessary when species-richness hotspots are fully covered by PAs (Rodrigues et al. 2011) . However, results of recent studies still support the idea that PD improves conservation planning by providing additional information that cannot be inferred from species richness (Hartmann & Andre 2013) or the presence of threatened species (Hidasi-Neto et al. 2013) .",

Fortunately, gaps between diversity priorities and existing PAs can be identified readily by overlaying maps of PAs with maps of the distributions of threatened species and regions in geographic information systems (Scott et al. 1993) . Based on such a gap analysis, many researchers have suggested amendments to PA systems for various taxa at local, regional, and global levels (e.g., Powell et al. 2000; Rodrigues et al. 2004a; Wen et al. 2015) . However, the mismatch between contemporary PA design and diversity priorities is still considerable (Rodrigues et al. 2004b) . For example, PA systems in Africa are unbalanced in favor of protecting vegetation types (van Breugel et al. 2015) . The PA systems in China and the United States also miss multiple potential or actual distributions of vulnerable species (Jenkins et al. 2015; Wen et al. 2015) . And, the PA network in Brazil's Cerrado does not cover the higher-than-expected PD and FD sites for bats and nonflying mammals (Carvalho et al. 2010) . Contemporary methods of PA design produce farfrom-optimal solutions; a more comprehensive PA planning process that considers more groups of species, evolutionary processes, and functional traits is still needed.",

Currently, official PAs are expanding quickly and have reached about 12.5% of Earth's land surface, but they may not achieve conservation goals because of inappropriate and insufficient management (Watson et al. 2014) . Lack of PA-coverage assessment in terms of evolutionary potential and functional traits may further impede the effectiveness of conservation practices. In the last decade in China, number of populations of over 65% of highly threatened animals have decreased (Gu et al. 2015) , despite the increase in PAs. A likely reason for this is the gap between existing PAs and future priorities. We considered hotspots of taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity and the conservation priorities of terrestrial vertebrates in China with the objective of assessing the conservation efficacy of current PA systems. It is difficult to identify and deduce suitable functional traits to analyze the FD for many species. We assumed, therefore, that PD represents FD to some extent (Faith 2013) . We overlaid the range maps of species (n = 2279) in 4 terrestrial vertebrate classes with PAs in China to determine whether at a regional scale information on phylogenetic diversity usefully supplements information on taxonomic diversity and the effectiveness of the current Chinese PA systems in protecting phylogenetic diversity and evolutionary distinctiveness.",

First, we computed PD sum (Faith's [1992] PD), which is the sum of the branch length of all species in one site and measures total evolutionary history (Faith 1992) . We extracted evolutionary distinctiveness scores (ED) from the phylogenies to describe species uniqueness (Isaac et al. 2007) . Relict species tend to have higher ED scores, implying they are more phylogenetically specialized than those that radiated recently. However, the length of evolutionary history does not predict the probability of future phylogenetic loss. Species with small range sizes compared with those that are widely distributed are probably much more vulnerable because their habitats may vanish under global climate change (Cadotte & Davies 2010) . Therefore, we divided species' ED by their own and their subtending species' global distribution areas (from IUCN) to get biogeographically weighted ED (BED) (Cadotte & Davies 2010). Besides distribution ranges, actual population sizes and dynamics also indicate extinction risk. We followed Issac (2007) to weight ED by threat status, referred to as evolutionary distinct and globally endangered (EDGE). We converted the IUCN threat status categories to numbers: 0, least concern = 0; 1, near threatened and conservation dependent; 2, vulnerable; 3, endangered; and 4, critically endangered. Data deficient has no value in Isaac's framework, but we assigned 1 to the category because more attention should be paid to species for which there are no data. Species in the top 25% of rankings of BED and EDGE were considered species at high risk of extinction. Regions where the richness of species with top-ranking BED and EDGE (BED R and EDGE R ) is high should be conservation priorities. We also calculated BED (BED C ) and EDGE (EDGE C ) of species in each grid to evaluate the overall vulnerability patterns.",

This indicated that these three indices provided little more information than species richness provided. The PA systems targeting species richness, therefore, protected PD and hotspots of phylogenetically endangered species equally well. The correlations of richness against BED R and BED C ranged from 0.160 to 0.614 (mean = 0.374 [SD 0.159]). Species richness was not a good predictor for phylogenetic endemism. However, regions with high BED R and BED C were patchily distributed and most were covered by hotspots of species richness. This means total evolutionary history, phylogenetic endemism, or phylogenetic distinctiveness would be protected if the PA fully covered areas of high species richness. However, null models decoupled richness and PD indicators. The SEZ of PD indicators was weak or even negatively related to richness (Table 1) .

However, reasons for applying PD are also clear. First, PD values for a given subset of species may deviate from expected values because of the powercurve relationship between PD and richness (Faith 2013) . However, in our analyses all phylogenetic diversity measures that involved the accumulation of species richness had strong positive linear relationships with species richness. We did not observe curvilinear relationships for the indices we applied. Second, species richness is not the only index that can be used to quantify biological value for conservation. In our study, PD ses distinguished richness hotspots with high PD from richness coldspots with relatively high PD. In regions with high PD and high richness, only phylogenetically clumped extinctions could strongly diminish PD (Faith 2013) . In regions with high PD but low species richness, each species contains more information on evolutionary processes and even functional traits. Richness losses there may lead to a rapid decline in local ecological services (Kareiva & Marvier 2003) . Such coldspots also require attention in conservation planning.",

This means far fewer hotspots are under the protection of national PAs. In China national PAs cover only a fraction of the most endangered animal hotspots: 10.9% for mammals, 1.13% for birds, and 7.26% for plants (Wen et al. 2015) . So, the efficiency of the PA system in China for conserving PD may not be too bad, but it is still far from satisfactory.",

First, priority areas were mainly distributed in mountainous regions; hotspots of birds and mammals were in the Hengduan Mountains (Fig. 3c, d ) and those of amphibians and reptiles in the Nanling and Wuyi Mountains (Figs. 3a-b) . For this reason, nature reserves that protect birds and mammals would not cover amphibians and reptiles very well. Biodiversity patterns of other taxa, such as insects and plants, may also differ from the 4 vertebrate groups (Wolters et al. 2006) . Distributions of PAs, especially national and provincial ones, should be balanced between hotspots of different taxa.",

Protected areas designed in regions with low TD but high PD (such as the Qingling Mountains for amphibians and Lower Yangtze Region for birds) (Fig. 2) should cause concern because slight declines in species there may result in considerable PD losses and even functional damage to local ecosystems. Similarly, some regions were not hotspots of most phylogenetically threatened species. However, they were more severely threatened than expected, including the east and south coast and northeast China which have many wetlands that are important for waterbirds (Fig. 2) . This indicates species with high threat status may occupy larger percentages of communities in those areas than in other regions. These regions should also receive high conservation priority because communities there are probably more vulnerable to anthropogenic interference. When funds are limited, trade-offs should be made between hotspots of vulnerable species and regions containing vulnerable communities.",

                "text": "Third, as in many other countries, the distribution of PAs is unbalanced (Watson et al. 2014) . In China coverage by nature reserves is greater in cold and barren regions, such as the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, whereas warm and productive regions are relatively poorly covered (Wen et al. 2015) . For example, the Qiangtang Nature Reserve for Tibetan Antelope (Pantholops hodgsonii), wild donkey (Equus kiang), and Przewalski's gazelle (Procapra przewalskii) covers over 250,000 km 2 and makes up about 20% of the total area of all national and provincial reserves. The mountain regions of southwest China and the wetlands of east China are among the top 25 global conservation priorities (Myers et al. 2000) and important habitats for water birds (BirdLife International 2017). They also hold the highest phylogenetic diversity and contain highly phylogenetically threatened communities of birds. However, nature reserves in these regions are small and patchy, which means habitat is fragmented. Habitat fragmentation would easily cause biodiversity loss (Wilson et al. 2016) , so that large PAs are better than many small ones. However, PA designs result not only from scientific but also political and economic choices. It is impractical to establish giant protected areas in the eastern half of China because of the dense human population and the pressing need for land for agriculture and industry. Preserving many small but well-managed and diversified landscapes may be an acceptable choice.",
