This bias stems from disparities in our knowledge of different organisms, and in the extent to which they are the focus of scientific research, across a wide range of biological disciplines. Some organisms -mostly plants and vertebrates -are over-represented in various scientific fields 7, 9, 10 , are more likely to raise funds 11 , or are considered ecologically more important than others 12 . It has been shown, however, that focusing on a few, often charismatic, species, prevents reaching global conclusions and developing efficient conservation plans 7, 13, 14 . Rare, small or uncharismatic creatures do play pivotal functions in ecosystems 15, 16 . In addition, biomimicry, i.e. the application of the properties of living organisms to technology, and bioprospecting activities, i.e. the search for new natural products in wild species, cannot be performed efficiently when less than 1% of known species have been carefully studied 17 .

Obviously, some organisms are more difficult to study than others because they live in remote habitats, are local endemics or are microscopic and difficult to identify 20 . But these intrinsic features alone cannot fully explain the pervasive taxonomic bias observed in science. Two hypotheses on the role of two extrinsic factors can then be put forward: the 'taxonomic research' hypothesis and the 'societal preferences' hypothesis. The 'societal preferences' hypothesis suggests that societal interests influence and bias the choice of study organisms 21, 22 . The 'taxonomic research' hypothesis implies that scientific reasons and limitations will lead and orientate biodiversity data gathering 20 . Because of the intricate interactions between scientists, citizens and funding agencies, and their mixed influence 23 , the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Nevertheless, these hypotheses deserve to be explored and confronted at a global taxonomic scale. Moreover, the recent development of citizen science 24 may have increased the impact of societal preferences. Here, to investigate the relative impact of 'societal preferences' and 'taxonomic research' on biodiversity data, we used the number of webpages from Bing searches and the number of publications retrieved from Web of Science, as proxies, respectively (see Methods).",

Fortunately, for ethical and scientific reasons [26] [27] [28] , data sharing practices and tools like the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) were developed, facilitating access to species occurrence records. The GBIF portal was chosen because it hosts the biggest open access primary biodiversity database and, even though the big data paradigm does not mean that big datasets are devoid of flaws, they offer a significant potential for new and broad insights 29 . Moreover, although open access primary biodiversity data are heterogeneous, resulting from the good will of contributors and not from a well-planned sampling protocol 30 , they reflect our knowledge and practices in the study of biodiversity.

Instead, we quantified taxonomic bias and imprecision (i.e. when an occurrence has been identified not at the species level but only at a higher taxonomic level) and related them to information provided in the occurrence records information (data origin, record date and locality). We tested the relative impact of societal preferences and taxonomic research on taxonomic bias, using public interest (i.e. the number of webpages) and taxonomic research quantity (i.e. the number of publications) as explaining variables, respectively.

Of the 2.2 million of species referenced in the GBIF taxonomic backbone, 1.2 million species can be found in the GBIF published datasets and 1.01 million belong to the 24 classes selected here. The number of recorded species per class was not proportional to their known species richness, highlighting a strong taxonomic bias. Aves and Insecta were, by far, the most over-and under-represented classes, respectively. Mammalia, Liliopsida, Actinopterygii, Amphibia and Magnoliopsida were also over-represented, whereas Arachnida, Gastropoda, Agaricomycetes, Malacostraca and Bacillariophyceae were under-represented ( Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1 ). This taxonomic bias was already apparent more than 50 years ago, meaning that classes that were over-or under-represented in the 1950\u2032s are still over-or under-represented today (Fig. 2) . Nonetheless, we found an increase in taxonomic bias over time, mostly due to the faster accumulation of data for birds compared to other classes (Fig. 3 top; 283 million bird occurrences recorded between 2000 and 2016). Recently, data has accumulated faster than ever before for most classes (Fig. 3 top, middle and Supplementary Fig. 2 ) however, Figure 1 . Taxonomic bias in biodiversity occurrence data.

The quantity of research was not significantly correlated with the number of occurrences for most classes, and, when the correlation was significant, it was either positive (e.g. Mammalia) or negative (e.g. Agaricomycetes). A significant correlation between public interest and research quantity was found in 10 out of 47 cases.",

Other vertebrate classes (Actinopterygii and Mammalia, and to a lesser extent Reptilia and Amphibia) are relatively well represented in the GBIF-mediated database, as are most Plantae classes, especially Liliopsida and Magnoliopsida. On the other hand, Arthropods (Insecta, Arachnida, Malacostraca and Maxillopoda) and Mollusca (Gastropoda and Bivalvia) are under-represented, with insects being particularly mis-represented.

For any study requiring a number of different sampling points, like those relying on niche modelling, the field of investigation is restricted to vertebrates and plants on land and Actinopterygii in aquatic habitats. Invertebrates and fungi, on the other hand, have to be virtually ignored because of insufficient data at the scale of the planet. Given that these neglected organisms have a high diversity and play crucial roles in diverse ecosystems 2, 3, 15 , this situation will inevitably result in an unbalanced fundamental knowledge of biodiversity, risky guesses and uninformed conservation decisions 7, 14, 19, 41, 42 . A similar taxonomic bias, with equivalent outcomes, is found between orders within each class. More disturbingly, we show that the taxonomic bias in biodiversity data, although known for a few decades 18 , has remained broadly the same since the 1950's. The evolution of taxonomic bias over time has rarely been investigated, and never at a large taxonomic scale. Bonnet et al. 9 , focusing on vertebrates, showed there had been no changes in taxonomic chauvinism in ecology and behavioural research. Similarly, Stahlschmidt 21 reported a static taxonomic bias from 2001 to 2010 in parental care research. He noted, however, that the absolute number of publications on parental care in birds increased significantly over this period. Along the same lines, Di Marco et al. 8 emphasized that, in conservation science, some historically under-studied taxa were receiving more attention today, but underlined that a taxonomic bias toward taxa that are threatened or less rich in biodiversity still exists. Our results confirm this status quo situation at a larger taxonomic scale: most classes that were under-or over-represented in the GBIF mediated database in 1950 are still under-or over-represented today. Even though most classes are better recorded today than before, the gap between birds and the rest of biodiversity (i.e. \u223c99% of known biodiversity) increases with time because bird occurrences accumulate much faster than other class occurrences. Thus, while most of biodiversity remains to be described 25 , the same taxa are preferentially studied and recorded over and over again.",

The role played by the general public in the study and conservation of biodiversity has already been established: positive links exist between public opinion, scientific productions and conservation policies, however the directionality of these interactions remains unclear 23, 43 . Our analyses confirm these interactions but do not allow us to clarify the causality issue. Although inevitable biases occur when using internet searches, such as the inability to distinguish scientific web pages from other web pages, particularly at such a broad taxonomic scale, \"many (30-80%) web pages containing the scientific names of species have little or nothing to do with scientific research\" 22 indicating that our results are presumably related to societal preferences.

Our results provide further evidence of this trend, highlighting the active role of the general public in biodiversity data collecting, given that, for instance, the biggest dataset was provided by eBird (211 million occurrences), a collective enterprise devoted to birds and partly relying on citizen science 45 . For multiple reasons (e.g. the difficulty of obtaining permits, more and more endangered species, citizen science programmes, population decline, etc.), less specimen-based occurrences are now reported. Amphibia, Gastropoda and Reptilia, the three classes with the highest proportion of specimen-based occurrences, are also the classes with a decreasing or stabilizing trend in data accumulation. We thus anticipate an increasing bias between taxa mostly known from observation-based occurrences and taxa mostly known from specimen-based occurrences. In addition, a lot of records are old and incomplete, and could soon, or already, be obsolete 46 , which risks reinforcing the taxonomic bias against classes with relatively few recent occurrences.",

Similarly, for most classes, occurrences accumulate at a much faster rate now that 50 or 30 years ago, which is an encouraging trend. Obviously, this trend can also result from changes in data-sharing practices, and not simply from overall data collection. Still, as we are accumulating more and more biodiversity data, the question of how to efficiently sample the whole of biodiversity remains open. The biodiversity knowledge chain is complex and its links influence one another. Scientists play a key role in this chain. However, our results show that they alone cannot ensure that biodiversity is sampled adequately and that societal preferences are too important to be ignored. Scientists must reach out to the lay audience 22, 23, 48 and advertise under-represented organisms to the general public. For instance, the crucial role of protists in ecosystem functioning probably seems too obscure to generate any interest from the general public 49 . New practices or methods, from citizen science to metagenomics, should also help increase public awareness and would have even more impact if programmes were developed jointly between science and society 20, 50 .

We focused on 24 taxonomic classes out of the 297 referenced in GBIF, excluding classes with less than 1 million occurrences (9.4 million occurrences from 19,000 species, had no class affiliation).

For each class, we quantified the level of taxonomic precision as the proportion of occurrences with information at the species level or lower. We assessed taxonomic bias by computing and comparing the following statistics for each class: the total number of occurrences (nb occ ), the median number of occurrences per species (med /sp ) and the median absolute deviation, the proportion of species with at least one occurrence (p >1 = n >1 /N), and the proportion of species with at least 20 occurrences (p >20 = n >20 /N), where n >i is the number of species with at least i occurrences and N is the number of known species for a given class. N was obtained using the GBIF taxonomic backbone (accessible at: http://doi.org/10.15468/39omei), by counting the number of distinct species with either the 'accepted' or 'doubtful' taxonomic status. This method excluded synonyms. Furthermore, we computed p >20d , the proportion of species with at least 20 spatially distinct occurrences. Two occurrences were considered spatially distinct when, using a global grid of 10*10 km cells based on the pseudocylindrical equal-area map projection Eckert IV, they fell in two different cells. We chose a threshold of 20 spatially distinct occurrences because it is a common threshold in niche modelling analyses 61 . Occurrences without spatial coordinates were excluded when computing the number of spatially distinct occurrences. We calculated how each class deviates from an 'ideal' sampling I, where each class is sampled proportionally to its number of known species (N). I = NB occ *(N/N tot ) where N tot is the total number of known species. To investigate the evolution of taxonomic bias over time, we excluded i) occurrences without a collection year and ii) occurrences recorded during the last 10 years because of the lag between recording and integration in the GBIF database (S. Gaiji, pers. comm.). The 'ideal' sampling I was calculated every ten years between 1956-2006 and deviations from these 'ideal' samplings were plotted for each class.",

We used an identical model for all classes, which was fitted using a negative binomial distribution to take into account overdispersion. Half of the GLMs were computed using the 1,000 best-represented species in GBIF (Best), while the other half used 1,000 random species referenced in GBIF (Random). Only one GLM was computed for Pinopsida because they had less than 1,000 species. Initial models were strongly influenced by extreme values and had poor resolution. Therefore we excluded outliers, which were identified when the number of occurrences or web search results was >Q 3 + 4 * IQR, where Q 3 is the third quartile value and IQR is the interquartile range.

Graph showing the first two axes of a Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) performed on 5 million random occurrences. Labels in black represent the categories considered for all occurrences. Classes' names (in green) are placed at the average position of the class occurrences. Occurrence age contains eight time intervals and an Unknown Year category; data origin contains three categories: Specimen for specimen-based occurrences, Observation for observation-based occurrences, and Unknown for unknown origins; data quality contains four categories: Temporal issue for the lack of year or month, Spatial issues for the lack of coordinates, Both issues and No issue.ScIentIfIc REPORTS | 7: 9132 | DOI:10.1038/s41598-017-09084-6 GLM results assessing the link between research quantity, public interest and their combined interaction on the amount of biodiversity data per class. A positive correlation between public interest and the number of occurrences was found in most classes. Values followed by * have a significant p-value at a 5% threshold. (+) indicates a positive influence while (-) indicates a negative influence of the variable on the number of occurrences.
