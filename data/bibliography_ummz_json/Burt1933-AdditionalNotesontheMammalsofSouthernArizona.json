This will go on until some hunter shoots the raccoon with a shot gun from the ground. However, with the great majority of uninitiated raccoons, they will go up a tree at the first signs of commotion, sit in the branches and watch the happenings below, unmindful of real danger; let a hunter shoot, or make all sorts of noise, and the raccoon. is oblivious to it. But let a bullet strike the branch on which he sits and he will scurry for protection higher in the tree.",

                "text": "These bats have here been referred to the subspecies merriami because, to me, they are indistinguishable from specimens of merriami taken on the coast of California. In 1904Elliot described what he supposed to be a new race, apus, from Providencia Mines, northeastern Sonora, Mexico. Through the courtesy of Director S. C. Simms and Dr. W. H. Osgood of the Field Museum I have been able to examine the type and three additional specimens of apus from Providencia Mines. There are also in the Dickey collection thirteen specimens from Saric, Sonora. The southern Arizona and northeastern Sonora specimens average slightly larger than California specimens of merriami, but the extreme measurements are about the same and the slight average difference loses its value. In the original description of apus the only character given by Elliot (1904, p. 269 ) that might distinguish that race from merriami is the larger foot. For the length 'of the foot Elliot gives 6.3 mm, which falls between the extremes of the Saric specimens (5.0 mm, to 6.5 mm.) as well as those of merriami from California (5.0 mm, to 6.5 mm., H. W. Grinnell, 1918, p. 313) , being slightly larger than those of hesperus (5.0 mm. to 6.0 mm., H. W. Grinnell, 1918, p. 307) . In coloration the southern Arizona and northeastern Sonora specimens fall in with merriami, being buffy both above and below instead of whitish as is the case in hesperus. In the Dickey collection are also two specimens from Paradox, Montrose County, Colorado, which fit in, in their dark coloration, with merriami, It seems to me that unless characters other than those given by Elliot, and other. than those which I have been able to discern, are found for the. Pipistrellus of northeastern Sonora, Elliot's name apus must be placed in synonomy under Pipistrellus hesperus merriami (Dobson). We then have a range for merriami similar to that given for IJlyotis californicus californicus by Miller and Allen (1928,p. 149) , with the metropolis of the race hesperus in the Great Basin area as is the case with Myotis californicus pallidus. Specimens of hesperus from near Las Vegas, Nevada, and Death Valley, California, show the extreme condition of pallor found in the subspecies.",

In the skulls there is very little difference, except that in the Parker Ranch gophers, the premaxillae project posteriorly farther beyond the nasals. Because of the differences in characters and in habitats of the two colonies of gophers, although they inhabit the same mountain range and are separated by a distance of only eight miles and 1,000 feet altitude, the Parker Ranch gophers might be regarded as subspecifically distinct, but until more data can be obtained on the local distribution of the gophers of the Santa Ritas, I prefer to treat them as a local variation of typical burti.",

It is less well known, although it has been pointed out on several occasions, that even among adults of a single race differences in absolute size may be accompanied by differences in proportions. Castle (1932), for example, has stated that in rabbits the skull steadily become's more slender, relatively, as the absolute size increases. Allen (1894) has shown the same situation prevailing in a species of Neotoma. Such changes may hold not only for individuals within a species but for different species within a genus, as Huxley (1932) so clearly demonstrated. Thus, the. same fundamental law of heterogonic growth in the various dimensions of the skull may act both inter-and intra-specifically. Castle (1932) remarked on this tendency among different species of rabbits and horses. The danger in using mere indices, without further analysis, as taxonomic criteria, especially for forms differing in absolute size, is at once apparent.The skeletons of at least some rodents, including the rat, Rattus norvegicus albinus (Strong, 1925) , and the Microtinae (Hinton, 1926) ",
