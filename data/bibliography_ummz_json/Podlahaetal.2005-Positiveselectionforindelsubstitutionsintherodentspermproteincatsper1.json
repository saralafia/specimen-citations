    "abstract": "Catsper1 is a voltage-gated calcium channel located in the plasma membrane of the sperm tail and is necessary for sperm motility and fertility in mice. We here examine the evolutionary pattern of Catsper1 from nine species of the rodent subfamily Murinae of family Muridae. We show that the rate of insertion/deletion (indel) substitutions in exon 1 of the gene is 4-15 times that in introns or neutral genomic regions, suggesting the presence of strong positive selection that promotes fixations of indel mutations in exon 1. The number of indel polymorphisms within species appears higher than expected from interspecific comparisons, although there are too little data to provide a statistically significant conclusion. These results, together with an earlier report in primates, indicate that positive selection promoting length variation in Catsper1 may be widespread in mammals. A structural model of Catsper1 suggested the importance of the exon 1-encoded region in regulating channel inactivation, which may affect sperm mobility and sperm competition. Our findings provide a necessary foundation for future experimental investigations of Catsper1's function in sperm physiology and role in sperm competition using rodent models.",

                "text": "The occurrence of positive Darwinian selection at the molecular level has been reported in many genes, particularly among those involved in immunity or reproduction (Hughes and Nei 1988; Lee, Ota, and Vacquier 1995; Rooney and Zhang 1999; Wyckoff, Wang, and Wu 2000; Swanson and Vacquier 2002; J. Zhang, Y. P. Zhang, and Rosenberg 2002; Wolfe and Li 2003; Wang and Zhang 2004; Zhang and Webb 2004) . In all these genes, it was shown that positive selection promotes amino acid replacements. In theory, positive selection may also act upon other types of sequence changes. In a previous report, we showed that positive selection was responsible for elevated fixation rates of insertions and deletions (indels) in the primate Catsper1 gene (Podlaha and Zhang 2003) , which codes for a voltage-gated calcium ion channel essential for sperm mobility (Ren et al. 2001) . Mice with the Catsper1 gene deleted are sterile (Ren et al. 2001) . Interestingly, the excess of indel substitutions was observed only in the first exon of Catsper1, which codes for the intracellular N-terminus of the channel. Based on the predicted structure of Catsper1 that includes six transmembrane domains and intracellular N-and C-termini (Ren et al. 2001) , we hypothesized that the length of the N-terminus may affect the rate of channel inactivation (Podlaha and Zhang 2003) , as in the so-called ''ball-andchain'' model (Bezanilla and Armstrong 1977; Hoshi, Zagotta, and Aldrich 1990; Zagotta, Hoshi, and Aldrich 1990) . Thus, the indels in Catsper1 may influence sperm mobility and consequently be an important factor in sperm competition (Podlaha and Zhang 2003) . The mouse Cats-per1 protein is found in the plasma membrane of the principle piece of the sperm tail (Ren et al. 2001) . But this location does not tell whether the products of one allele or both alleles of the gene are present in an individual sperm, as it is possible that the progenitor diploid cells of sperm express both alleles whose products get incorpo-rated into the sperm. A recent study, however, showed that Catsper1 expression is confined to the postmeiotic stage of spermatogenesis (Schultz, Hamra, and Garbers 2003) , strongly suggesting that only the product of one allele is present in each sperm. This provides the possibility of haploid selection on (Joseph and Kirkpatrick 2004) and meiotic drive of (Hartl and Clark 1997) Catsper1 if the two alleles confer different fitnesses. These hypotheses about the function of and selection on Catsper1 are difficult to test in primates because of the difficulties in housing animals and in obtaining biological materials. Rodents would be more convenient and suitable for addressing these questions. We here sequence the Catsper1 gene in multiple species belonging to the rodent subfamily Murinae of family Muridae and multiple individuals of the species Mus musculus and Mus macedonicus. We show that the phenomenon of accelerated indel substitutions observed in primates also occurs in rodents. This opens the possibility for experimental examination of the functional and evolutionary significance of the indel substitutions in rodent Catsper1.",

The number of indel substitutions that occurred in the rodent Catsper1 sequences was counted using the parsimony principle based on the species tree. In cases where multiple equally parsimonious solutions for a single alignment gap were encountered, all solutions were weighted equally. Because there are no unequivocal estimates of absolute divergence times among the Mus taxa included in our study, we calculated the rate of indel substitutions per unit of d S distance (number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site), rather than per unit of time. This approach allows us to make reliable comparisons of indel rates across all lineages and avoid the imprecision inherent in divergence time estimates. Branch lengths for a given tree topology were calculated using the BNBS program (Zhang, Rosenberg, and Nei 1998) . The genomic average rate of indel substitutions in mouse and rat (Rat Genome Sequencing Consortium 2004) was used as an approximation of the neutral rate of indel substitutions.",

                "text": "We determined from the mouse (M. musculus) genome sequence that Catsper1 is located in chromosome 19 and is composed of 12 exons totaling 2,061 nt. A comparison of the mouse Catsper1 and its human ortholog revealed a large number of alignment gaps in the first exon, whereas the rest of the sequences remained relatively conserved. Because our previous study in primates showed that exon 1, which codes for the majority of the N-terminal intracellular region of the ion channel, has been under positive selection for indel substitutions, we here focus on the same exon in rodents. In fact, the alignment of the mouse and rat Catsper1 sequences showed a high frequency of both amino acid replacements and indels in the region encoded by exon 1 (fig. 1 ). We obtained DNA sequences of Catsper1 exon 1 from 19 individuals of 9 Mus species. No heterozygous individuals were found. In addition, we downloaded from GenBank one Catsper1 sequence from M. musculus and one from R. norvegicus. Thirteen different nucleotide sequences and 12 different protein sequences were found among the 21 Catsper1 exon 1 sequences obtained ( fig. 2 ). These raw sequences varied in length from 808-856 nt, with the open reading frame being intact in each of them. Sequence alignment by ClustalX was straightforward and robust, without the need for manual adjustments. The alignment of the sequences, spanning 910 nt, contained numerous gaps ranging in number from five in M. pahari to 10 in one of the M. musculus A gene tree of the 21 sequences was reconstructed using the neighbor-joining method (Saitou and Nei 1987) , which shows a branching pattern that is largely consistent with the assumed species phylogeny ( fig. 3 ), indicating that the sequences are indeed orthologous to each other. Furthermore, all allelic sequences within species cluster in species-specific clades. Using the parsimony principle, we inferred the number of indels in Catsper1 exon 1 and mapped them onto the species tree ( fig. 3 ). For example, the branch that leads to M. musculus has 2.17 indels because this branch is representative of 12 individuals from the M. musculus species, and while all of them share two indels, two individuals show one unique indel each in the alignment. Therefore, averaged across all 12 individuals, there are 0.17 individual-specific indels in addition to the two indels shared by all. Note that parsimony makes our inference of the number of indels conservative. A total of 22.47 indel substitutions were found throughout the tree ( fig. 3 ). We then calculated the average number of indel events for different parts of the tree, dividing the taxa into groups M1 (M. musculus, M. macedonicus, M. spicilegus, and M. spretus), M2 (M. cervicolor, M. cookii, and M. caroli), M3 (M. pahari), and R (R. norvegicus) (table 1 and fig. 3 ). The average number of indel substitutions from the common ancestor of a group to all terminal nodes in the group is computed by averaging the number of indels between sister lineages in the group in a hierarchical manner. For example, the number for M1 is ((((0 1 0)/2 1 0) 1 1)/2 1 0 1 2.17)/2 5 1.34. The average number of indels between species of two groups was subsequently computed by adding the number of indels between the common ancestors of the two groups and the numbers from the common ancestors to terminal nodes (table 1) . For example, the number of indels between M1 and R is 4.83 1 5.67 1 1.34 5 11.84 (table 1 and fig. 3 ).",

For this we used the recently published mouse-rat genomic comparison (Cooper et al. 2004) . It was estimated that indel substitutions in bulk genomic DNA have a frequency of 12.46 indels/kb between mouse and rat. This rate of indel substitution should be very close to the neutral rate as only 1%-1.5% of the mammalian genome are coding sequences (Human Genome Sequencing Consortium 2001). Because indels of sizes other than multiples of 3 nt (3n) will almost certainly be highly deleterious in coding regions, it is necessary to compute the neutral substitution rate for 3n indels. The proportion of 3n indels is less than one-third of all indels because the frequency of indels declines rapidly with size in a nonlinear fashion. Studies of the indel size distribution in mammalian genomes show that approximately 17%-19% of all indels are 3n indels (Britten 2002; Silva and Kondrashov 2002; Makova, Yang, and Chiaromonte 2004) . In particular, the proportion of 3n indels for mouse and rat was 17.3% (Makova, Yang, and Chiaromonte 2004) . Applying this value to the neutral rate of indel substitutions, we estimated that the neutral substitution rate of 3n indels is 2.156 indels/ kb between mouse and rat.",

To discriminate between these two possibilities, we assessed the indel mutation rate in the Catsper1 locus by examining the intron sequences. Because the majority of sites in introns are more or less neutral, the indel substitution rate in Catsper1 introns reflects the local indel mutation rate at the locus. We found a total of 106 indels in the 6,739-nt-long alignment of the 11 introns of Catsper1 between mouse and rat. Applying the genomic neutral indel substitution rate to the Catsper1 introns, we would expect to see 86.2 indels between mouse and rat, which is significantly different from the observed number (P 5 0.02, Poisson test). The indel mutation rate at Cats-per1 is 23% greater than the genomic average. However, even when this elevated mutation rate is considered, we still find the observed number of indels in Catsper1 exon 1 to be 4-15 times the neutral expectation at the locus. Except for the M1-M2 comparison, all other group comparisons are statistically significant (table 1) . These results strongly suggest that 3n indels have been favored by positive selection in rodent Catsper1 exon 1.

From the intraspecific data of M. musculus and M. macedonicus, we found two indel polymorphisms and one synonymous polymorphism. The number of fixed differences between the two species is two and four for indels and synonymous changes, respectively. The interspecific indel/synonymous ratio of 2:4 is not significantly different from the intraspecific ratio of 2:1 (Fisher's exact test, P . 0.2). Therefore, this modified Mcdonald and Kreitman test does not reject the hypothesis that the selective intensity on indels is identical between the interspecific and intraspecific data. The above test has a low power here because both intraspecific and interspecific differences are small in our data. When the entire tree of figure 3 is considered, the indel/synonymous ratio of 22:61 is found. However, this ratio is again not significantly different from the intraspecific indel/synonymous ratio of 2:1 found in M. musculus and M. macedonicus (Fisher's exact test, P . 0.1). Nevertheless, the ratio appears higher for the intraspecific data than for the interspecifc data at face value.",

                "text": "The sequences of rodent Catsper1 exon 1 show many amino acid replacements in addition to indels. Over 50% of pairwise comparisons have more nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site (d N ) than synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (d S ) ( fig. 4) , with an average d N /d S ratio of all comparisons being 1.18. The standard Mcdonald and Kreitman test, comparing nonsynonymous/synonymous ratios within species (3:1 for M. musculus and M. macedonicus) and between species (229:61 for the entire tree), showed no significant differences (P . 0.5), suggesting that the selective pressure on nonsynonymous changes is indistinguishable between the intraspecific and interspecific levels. The average d N /d S ratio of approximately 1 in the pairwise comparisons may be a result of several factors. One possibility is that several sites in exon 1 of Catsper1 are under positive selection while others are under purifying selection. Alternatively, the region may be experiencing a relaxation of functional constraint. It is unlikely that exon 1 of Catsper1 would evolve completely neutrally because deleting the gene in mice leads to infertility (Ren et al. 2001) . Also, despite many indels present in the first exon of Catsper1, the open reading frame remains undisrupted. It is therefore more plausible that several sites are evolving under positive selection for amino acid replacements, while other sites are under functional constraints, rendering the overall d N /d S ratio approximately 1. To test this hypothesis, we performed a likelihood analysis using PAML (Yang 1997) . Specifically, we compared models M7 and M8 (Yang et al. 2000) . M7 is a null model, which assumes that the d N /d S ratio across codons follows a beta distribution in the range of 0-1. M8 is identical to M7 except for an additional class of codons with a free d N /d S ratio. Our likelihood ratio test showed that M8 fits our data significantly better than M7 (v 2 5 46.77, df 5 2, P , 0.001), with an additional class of sites having d N /d S 5 5.78. It has been suggested that a better way to test for positive selection is to compare the alternative hypothesis of M8 with the null hypothesis of M8a (Swanson, Nielsen, and Yang 2003) . M8a is a special case of M8, where instead of estimating one additional class of sites with any d N /d S ratio, M8a fixes this d N /d S ratio to 1. The use of M8a seems to reduce false positives (Suzuki and Nei 2001; Zhang 2004) caused by codon sites under weak or no selection because these get absorbed in the neutral class of sites with d N /d S 5 1 (Wong et al. 2004) . In our analysis, M8 fit the data significantly better than M8a (v 2 5 45.03, df 5 1, P , 0.001), suggesting that positive selection for nonsynonymous substitutions may indeed be acting on the first exon of rodent Catsper1, a result consistent with that found in primates.",

                "text": "What selective agents are behind the extraordinarily rapid pace of indel substitutions in the sperm ion channel encoded by Catsper1? Genes belonging to the Catsper family encode putative voltage-gated Ca 21 (Ca V ) ion channels. A recent study showed that Catsper1 is necessary for depolarization-evoked Ca 21 entry and for hyperactive sperm movement (Carlson et al. 2003) . The onset of hyperactive movement occurs near the site of fertilization and is crucial for penetrating the egg's zona pellucida. Although direct evidence showing that Catsper1 forms a voltagegated ion channel is still lacking, the requirement of Cats-per1 for depolarization-evoked entry of Ca 21 strongly supports such a hypothesis (Carlson et al. 2003) . Several other members of the Catsper family have been identified, and all share a common expression in sperm (Quill et al. 2001; Lobley et al. 2003) . It was thus conjectured that Cats-per1, 2, 3, and 4 form a functional heterotetramer in sperm; however, empirical evidence for this hypothesis is lacking (Lobley et al. 2003) . The putative ion channel formed by Catsper1 resembles K V channels more than Ca V channels in structure, as Catsper1 and K V channels are formed by four peptides rather than a single long peptide with four repeats. This structural similarity to K V ion channels prompted us to hypothesize a regulatory mechanism for Catsper1 similar to the ball-and-chain model (Bezanilla and Armstrong 1977) , in which strong positive selection could occur for indel substitutions in the N-terminus of Catsper1 (Podlaha and Zhang 2003) . Specifically, it was found that the action of the K V channel Shaker in Drosophila follows the ball-and-chain model, in which the length of the N-terminus directly affects the rate of the channel's inactivation (Hoshi, Zagotta, and Aldrich 1990) . If a similar regulatory mechanism indeed operates in Catsper1, different N-terminus lengths could have a direct functional effect on the channel's performance and consequently on sperm motility (Podlaha and Zhang 2003) .",

                "text": "The physiological function and molecular evolutionary pattern of Catsper1 suggest that it is a candidate for direct involvement in sperm competition. Further understanding of the evolutionary forces acting on this gene requires that questions about Catsper1 expression and fitness effects be addressed. Because Catsper1 is expressed in sperm, could it possibly be under haploid selection? For a gene to be haploid selected, it is necessary to show that each sperm contains the product of only one allele of the gene and that the two alleles confer different fitnesses (Joseph and Kirkpatrick 2004) . Rare examples of haploid selection have been documented in sperm adhesion molecule 1 Spam1 (Zheng, Deng, and Martin-DeLeon 2001) , segregation distortion responder Rsp (Kusano et al. 2003) , and the t-locus responder Tcr (Herrmann et al. 1999) . Although no direct demonstration of haploid selection in Catsper1 exists, two lines of evidence lead us to believe that this is the case. First, Catsper1 (as well as Catsper2, Catsper3, Catsper4) is solely expressed in testis and no other reproductive tissue (Genomics Institute of the Novaris Research Foundation SymAtlas; http://symatlas. gnf.org/SymAtlas/). Second, the timing of Catsper1 expression is confined to the postmeiotic stage of spermatogenesis (Schultz, Hamra, and Garbers 2003) , strongly suggesting that only one allele is expressed in each sperm. Haploid selection can result in meiotic drive, which refers to the phenomenon of nonrandom segregation in heterozygotes (Hartl and Clark 1997) . Such haploid selection and meiotic drive could generate an ''arms-race'' between alleles and result in high levels of intraspecific polymorphism and interspecific divergence. Haploid selection and meiotic drive can be tested by genotyping the offspring of heterozygous males and examining the competitive advantage of a particular length variant of Catsper1 over another variant. Such experiments are feasible in mice, where it is faster and easier to obtain individuals of a particular genotype and acquire data on reproductive success than in primates. Cats-per1 is a promising candidate gene for sperm competition as sperm motility has been shown to be one of its decisive factors (Birkhead et al. 1999) . The present study, as well as our previous analysis in primates, reveals strong positive selection on the length of Catsper1. Furthermore, it provides a necessary foundation for future experimental investigations of Catsper1's function in sperm physiology and role in sperm competition using rodent models.",
