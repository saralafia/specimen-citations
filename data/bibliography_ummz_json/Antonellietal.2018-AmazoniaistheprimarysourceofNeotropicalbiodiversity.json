It is now clear that different regions and taxonomic groups have responded differently to geological and climatic changes. However, we still lack a basic understanding of how Neotropical biodiversity was assembled over evolutionary timescales. Here we infer the timing and origin of the living biota in all major Neotropical regions by performing a crosstaxonomic biogeographic analysis based on 4,450 species from six major clades across the tree of life (angiosperms, birds, ferns, frogs, mammals, and squamates), and integrate >1.3 million species occurrences with large-scale phylogenies. We report an unprecedented level of biotic interchange among all Neotropical regions, totaling 4,525 dispersal events. About half of these events involved transitions between major environmental types, with a predominant directionality from forested to open biomes. For all taxonomic groups surveyed here, Amazonia is the primary source of Neotropical diversity, providing >2,800 lineages to other regions. Most of these dispersal events were to Mesoamerica (\u223c1,500 lineages), followed by dispersals into open regions of northern South America and the Cerrado and Chaco biomes. Biotic interchange has taken place for >60 million years and generally increased toward the present. The total amount of time lineages spend in a region appears to be the strongest predictor of migration events. These results demonstrate the complex origin of tropical ecosystems and the key role of biotic interchange for the assembly of regional biotas.",

Biotic triggers of speciation include species interactions (10, 11) and soil adaptations (12) , as well as the evolution of other organism-specific traits. Neotropical diversification has been extensive in some regions, such as Amazonia, where speciation in rainforest environments has taken place since at least the Paleocene (\u223c58 Mya, Ma; ref. 13) .

Based on the Theory of Island Biogeography (29) , there should be a positive relationship between the number of dispersal events and the area of a region, and a negative relationship with geographic isolation. Similarly, the more shared perimeter (adjacency) two regions have, the more interchange should also be expected (28) . However, many Neotropical regions and biomes have changed considerably through time (9), making it crucial to also consider historical changes in a region's area and connectivity. In general, the more combined time lineages spend in a region (expressed as total branch lengths in a phylogeny), the more opportunities they should have to diversify and emigrate (30, 31) . Regions with high diversity could be more difficult to enter than species-poor regions, because of competitive exclusion and niche filling (32, 33) , or show the opposite pattern, based on empirical evidence from invasive species (34, 35) . To date, none of these variables has been assessed as a general predictor of biotic interchange in the Neotropics.",

Fossils can be useful for inferring biogeographic history (36) , but the Neotropical fossil record is too scarce for most periods, regions, and taxonomic groups to allow robust estimates (37) . We therefore take advantage of recently published, well-sampled molecular phylogenies, which hold a large but unrealized potential in revealing the evolution of tropical biotas (17, 38) . We integrate these phylogenies with large species occurrence datasets, spatial information on Neotropical regions and biomes, and their evolution and connectivity through time. We address the following questions: was the amount of biotic interchange similar among Neotropical regions, or have particular regions contributed substantially more or less than others? How often were dispersal events associated with shifts between major biome types? To what extent was the direction of interchange determined by taxonomic group? Did biotic interchange among regions occur evenly through time, or were there periods of more frequent dispersal events? Which general descriptors of a region and its biota predict the amount of biotic interchange with other regions?",

This result could primarily reflect dispersal events between the Choc\u00f3, included in Olson's (47) definition of Amazonia adopted here, and Mesoamerica. A biogeographic analysis using a different expert-based region classification, in which we adopted a more restrictive delimitation of Amazonia, suggests that most interchange indeed involves Amazonia (SI Appendix, Fig. S21 ). Our results corroborate a recent analysis of plot data for rainforest woody plants, which showed a large number of shared species between Panama and eastern Ecuador and concluded that the abundance and environmental tolerance of species were strong predictors of their ability to occupy both regions (48) .",

Our study shows that Amazonia is the primary source of Neotropical biodiversity: not only did it generate enormous in situ diversity but it also provided lineages to all other Neotropical regions, across all studied taxonomic groups, and throughout the Cenozoic. Taken together, our results demonstrate that even very dissimilar regions, in terms of environmental variables and constituent biota, do not evolve in isolation, but are highly biologically interconnected over evolutionary timescales. Biotic interchange can be largely, but not fully, predicted by simple abiotic and biotic variables. The cross-taxonomic framework applied here could be used to investigate the evolutionary history of many other regions and biotas, to better understand the history of life on Earth.",

Within the Neotropics, we defined and delimited 10 regions, broadly corresponding to environmentally and biologically different terrestrial biomes proposed by Olson et al.

We reconstructed the biogeographic history of two groups of plants (angiosperms and ferns) and four groups of vertebrates (birds, frogs, mammals, and squamates). We downloaded occurrence records for all species from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (SI Appendix, Supporting Methods). We used SpeciesGeoCoder v.1.8 (51) for automated cleaning of the occurrence records. We classified each species as present or absent in each Neotropical region, using an occurrence filter of \u22655% to recognize a species as present in a region (selected to maximize inclusion while minimizing false-positives, after testing for multiple thresholds between 0% and 50%; SI Appendix, Fig. S23 ). We retrieved published large-scale time-calibrated phylogenies for all study groups (see SI Appendix for references), from which we extracted predominantly Neotropical clades (\u226585% of the species).",

We use the terms migration and dispersal interchangeably in a biogeographic context, meaning establishment of evolutionary lineages in a new region rather than, for example, annual bird migrations. We do not attempt to differentiate between dispersal and vicariance, that is, the separation of populations by the formation of barriers, which has also contributed to shaping current diversity patterns in the Neotropics (52) . We implemented the dispersalextinction-cladogenesis model (53) in the R package BioGeoBEARS (54) to infer geographical range evolution of lineages. We developed two sets of analyses: one in which biotic connectivity among all regions was allowed at any point in time, and one in which we modeled connectivity based on paleogeographic and geological evidence (SI Appendix, Table S3 ). We identified shifts between regions in 5-My time bins. We computed the absolute number of dispersal events through time by extracting the areas and ages of all nodes from each phylogeny. The number of branches and total amount of branch lengths in any phylogeny of extant species increase with time, potentially increasing the number of dispersal events toward the present even under a constant dispersal rate (55) . We therefore also calculated relative numbers of dispersal events by dividing absolute numbers by the total length of all branches within each time bin (37) . We tested the dependence of the number of dispersal events estimated for each region on six predictor variables ( Fig. 5 ; excluding one because of high correlation). We tested the covariance of the predictors using the Variance Inflation Factor and Pearson correlations. We fit two linear mixedeffects models with a random intercept, using taxon as random effect in a Bayesian framework. We excluded data from the two taxa with the fewest species sampled (ferns and frogs), as the number of dispersal events was zero for several regions in these clades, and assumed one shift for the remaining The values correspond to dispersal events inferred from time-calibrated molecular phylogenies estimated under an unconstrained and a time-stratified biogeographic model of region connectivity (SI Appendix, Tables S5 and S6). three cases with no observed shifts to enable logarithmic transformation. We log-transformed predictors and responses and used a gamma prior with shape 1 and scale 0.5 for the hyper parameters of the random intercepts per taxon.",
