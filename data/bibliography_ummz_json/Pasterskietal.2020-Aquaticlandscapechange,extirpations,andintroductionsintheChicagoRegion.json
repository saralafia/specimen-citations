    "abstract": "Prior to European settlement, swamps, marshes, lakes, and streams were the major landscape features of the Chicago region. Much of this has been altered or lost in the past one-hundred-and-fifty years. We examined the changes in aquatic environments and fauna in Cook County, Illinois, using 1890-1910 and 1997-2017 as our focus intervals. The extents of aquatic features from historical topographic maps were imported into a GIS database and compared with the modern USGS National Hydrography Dataset. Historical and modern spatial data on aquatic animals were collected from museum collection and survey reports. Overall, the total area of wetlands and water bodies has decreased by about a third, while swamps and marshes have been drained or converted into lakes and ponds. Fifty-four of 80 historic molluscan species are not recently recorded, and 26 current species are not recorded in the historical data, including 6 considered to be invasive. Of 54 fish species in the historic data, 23 are no longer present and about 50% of the remaining species have undergone range reductions. Three out of 10 species of reptiles have disappeared. All 25 aquatic birds reported from the 1890-1910 period are still extant and an additional 13 have been reported in recent times, possibly due to increased collection effort. The Chicago region provides a case study of the impact of anthropogenic landscape change on biota. Large scale extirpations of native species have corresponded to a shift to a highly fragmented landscape of small ponds and reduced swamps and marshes.",

Wetlands are areas with water at or near the soil surface for varying periods of the year, with habitats including marshes, bogs and fens, and the boundary regions of streams, rivers, and lakes. These habitats are critical to the environment because they can regulate processes such as pollutant removal, groundwater recharge and discharge, basin connectivity, and nutrient cycling (Jackson and Pringle 2010; Montgomery and Eames 2008; Wright et al. 2006) , as well as host diverse ecologies (Lehikoinen et al. 2016; Quesnelle et al. 2015) .",

Concerns with the decrease led to the 1989 adoption by the United States of a \"no net loss\" policy concerning wetlands, meaning that an equal amount of wetland ecospace must be established in a different location for every amount that is destroyed. This policy resulted in wetlands being shifted 10's to 100's of kilometers to underdeveloped areas leading to declines in biodiversity (Robertson 2004; Robertson 2006; BenDor et al. 2007; BenDor 2009; BenDor et al. 2009; Ward et al. 2010; BenDor and Riggsbee 2011) .",

(Brant et al. 2017) , massive losses of wetlands have occurred as a result of urbanization (Sullivan 1997; Robertson 2004; Robertson 2006; BenDor et al. 2007; BenDor 2009; Ward et al. 2010) . These include the total loss of the marshes surrounding the Kankakee River (Clark and Slusher 2000) and the extensive loss of the wetlands of the Calumet region (Greenberg 2002) . These losses have been accompanied by major shifts in the hydrology of the river systems, most notably the 1900 opening of the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal. The Sanitary and Ship canal, along with locks built at the mouth of the Chicago River at Lake Michigan, had the effect of reversing the flow of the Chicago River so that wastewater no longer flowed into the lake (Hill 2000) . At the same time, the development of the Calumet Sag Channel also led to the reversal of the Little Calumet River toward the Mississippi (Schoon 2003) .",

Area A was chosen for statistical analysis because the transition from relatively large wetlands to small lakes that occurred throughout Cook County, IL, between the two study periods was well represented in that region; therefore, the spatial statistics we calculated for area A are representative of regional trends. We used Riply's L(d) to statistically determine if the historic and modern wetlands are randomly distributed, clumped together, or fragmented throughout area A. Latitudes and longitudes of the centerpoints of each water body for historic and modern lakes and wetlands in this area were used to produce matrices of spherical interpoint distances using PASSaGE v. 2.0 (Rosenberg and Anderson 2011). PASSaGE was then used to calculate Ripley's L(d) second-order statistic (without edge correction; Young and Young 1998 ). Values of L(d) are generated for a range of distances (d) and L(d) is plotted against d. If, at the scale of resolution, the point pattern is completely spatially random (csr), L(d) = 0. In PASSaGE, patterns that are more regular (i.e. there are fewer points within distance d than the random expectation) have L(d) > 0. If the points are more clumped (i.e. there are more points within distance d than the random expectation), L(d) < 0.",

This is in keeping with observed extirpations and extinctions throughout North America (Haag and Williams 2014) , largely attributed to landscape change, such as stream impoundment. This is especially true for unionid bivalves, which are burrowing suspension feeders commonly known in North America as \"freshwater mussels\" or \"river mussels\". Unionids have a unique life cycle adaptation where their larvae are dependent on parasitizing a host fish (Waters 2006) . This dependence means that unionids are vulnerable to fish population fluctuations. Habitat loss and fragmentation, changes in water quality, and competition with invasive species are all probable drivers of species loss in gastropods and bivalves, with the losses in the latter also being driven by the correlative decline in native fish populations.",

The alewife and goldfish were likely introduced by accident, the alewife due to the construction of the Welland Canal in the 1820's, which connected Lake Ontario and Lake Eerie, and the goldfish by release from ornamental ponds (Laird and Page 1996) . The salmonids were introduced as sport fish and are still stocked to maintain their presence. Other introductions are inadvertent, such as by the dumping of bait by anglers (Keller and Lodge 2007) or animals being transported between water bodies in ship ballast (Mills et al. 1993 ). The Asian carp species were initially introduced to control algae in aquaculture and municipal wastewater treatment facilities in the early 1970s but were able to escape into the Illinois River and now pose a significant threat to the Great Lakes ecosystems. The large Asian carp population numbers and potential unbalanced effect on the food web could result in reduced native species diversity and abundances (Tsehaye et al. 2013). Coordinated efforts to curb the spread of the species into Lake Michigan and the Great Lakes system through intensive commercial fishing have been implemented in hopes of reducing populations to the point of collapse (Garvey et al. 2012) .",

Although this number is low, the three eBird observations provide evidence that the Black Tern may still reside in Cook County. For the Common Merganser, the Bank Swallow, and Yellow-headed Blackbird, there were enough non-migration period observations for us to reasonably assume that all three species may be present in Cook County.

The seven reptilian species that maintained their presence are the plains garter snake (Thamnophis radix), the common garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis), the red-bellied snake (Storeria occipitomaculata), the brown snake (Storeria dekayi), the smooth green snake (Opheodrys vernalis), the Northern water snake (Nerodia sipedon), and the snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina). All seven species present in both modern and historic time periods are listed by the IUCN as species of Least Concern and have stable regional populations. The three extirpated species are the Blanding's turtle (Emydoidea blandingii), the eastern musk turtle (Sternotherus odoratus) and the queen snake (Regina septemvittata). E. blandingii is the only species in the herpetological dataset listed as endangered.",

I n I n d i a n a , E. blandingii suffers from increased predation, habitat loss, and road mortality, as well as long generation times making the populations less resilient to rapid changes in the ecosystem; these factors are likely also affecting the populations in the Chicago region (Walston et al. 2015) . S. odoratus (the Eastern musk turtle) is rare throughout the Great Lakes region. S. odoratus prefer high-quality wetlands with relatively low human disturbance and are not found in degraded, low-quality wetlands within their range (DeCatanzaro and Chow-Fraser 2010). The queen snake may be locally abundant when there's suitable habitat available, which can be a variety of freshwater wetlands and waterbodies. Because this species feeds almost exclusively on crayfish (Jackrel and Reinert 2011), declines in crayfish populations due to pollution, acid rain, waste runoff from livestock or poultry, siltation from urban/agricultural runoff, in addition to destruction of wetlands, stream channelization, and large impoundments have resulted in declines and possible extirpations of R. septemvittata in northern and western regions of its range (Hammerson 2007) .",

Post-release follow-up was completed through recording anecdotal sightings and Illinois Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) surveys (Bluett et al. 2004; Raesly 2001 ). The report by Bluett et al. (2004) on the status of the river otter after reintroduction includes twelve reports of otters within the Des Plaines River and Lake Michigan Tributaries, and a biologist-identified site in southern Cook County where the presence of river otters was detected either through tracks, scat or prey remains between 1999 and 2004. This, along with 23 additional reports in the nearby Fox (which crosses northwest Cook County) and Kankakee (just south of Cook County) river basins, was strong evidence that otters have made an incursion back into Cook County; an individual otter caught by wildlife biologists in a southwestern Cook County Forest Preserve in 2015 is confirmation. Whether the otters have migrated from reintroduced specimens from watersheds further down the state or from naturally occurring populations in northwest Indiana is unknown. Whether or not there are enough specimens to be a stable population still remains to be explored.",

Since ca. 1900, major extirpations have occurred among bivalves, snails, and fish and to a lesser extent among reptiles. Much of this is clearly related to loss of habitat, reduction in water quality and the shrinking of both wetland and lake size (Roach and Griffith 2015) . At the same time, a large number of introduced and invasive species have also entered the region, so that some groups, such as fishes and birds, have actually increase in species diversity. Some of this growth may be an artifact of increased intensity of study. It is unclear what impact the fragmentation of the aquatic landscape has had on connectivity among the remaining species and implications for their conservation (Riffell et al. 2003; Fahrig 2017; Fahrig et al. 2019) ; this should be a subject of future studies.",
