                "text": "Convergence is widely regarded as compelling evidence for adaptation, often being portrayed as evidence that phenotypic outcomes are predictable from ecology, overriding contingencies of history (e.g., Losos et al. 1998; Melville et al. 2006; Mahler et al. 2013; Wollenberg et al. 2013; Collar et al. 2014; Friedman et al. 2016) . But convergence itself may be contingent on a simple adaptive landscape, one characterized by a limited array of niches that is replicated across environments and by a single optimum per niche. Convergence is thus most likely when ecological constraints limit the array of niches and functional constraints specify a single optimum for each niche. On such a simple landscape, we would expect (1) lineages to converge on the array of niches and, (2) that species that converge ecologically will also converge morphologically, regardless of geographic context or ancestral morphologies. That combination of strong ecological and functional constraints is hypothesized to explain rampant convergence in damselfish (Cooper and Westneat 2009; Frederich et al. 2013) and desert iguanian lizards (Melville et al. 2006) . The combination of strong ecological and functional constraints, however, may be very rare making convergence generally unlikely. One well-known explanation for the low frequency of convergence is the many-to-one mapping of form onto function; that mapping means that multiple morphologies are functionally equivalent (Hulsey and Wainwright 2002; Alfaro et al. 2005; Wainwright et al. 2005; Collar et al. 2014) . Another explanation is the converse, the one-to-many mapping of form onto ecology: because a single functionally versatile morphology can exploit diverse resources; a species with a specialized morphology is not restricted to a specialized resource but can switch to it when other resources are limited and competition is most intense (Liem 1980; Robinson and Wilson 1998; Bellwood et al. 2006) . Functional versatility reduces the probability of convergence because that versatile morphology persists despite ecological divergence or convergence.",

This many-to-many relationship arises from the multidimensionality of both ecological classes and function. In some cases, it might be possible to treat niches as one dimensional, arrayed along a continuum with thresholds (Revell 2014) . But diet classes, for example, cannot be arrayed along a single continuum. It may be possible to characterize two extremes, such as probing for colonial insects with a long tongue and gnawing hard nuts but others, including slicing leaves, crushing fruit or seeds, and gouging bark do not lie between them. Foods such as fruits can vary along multiple dimensions because they can be soft and pulpy, fibrous and tough, or hard shelled and resistant to fracture, and they can also be tiny such as blueberries or large like coconuts. Behaviors used to exploit foods with particular properties can also vary; for example, hard, fracture-resistant foods can be eaten by gouging, prying, shaving, puncturing, crushing, or even by using tools. Because of the many combinations of variation in material properties and feeding behaviors, species that belong to a single dietary class will experience different loading regimes resulting in different patterns of internal stresses and strains on their skeletons (Ross et al. 2012) and therefore have different optimal morphologies.",

Multidimensionality, in general, reduces the probability of convergence (Stayton 2008) hence strong ecological and functional constraints increase the probability of convergence by limiting the array of accessible niches and optimal forms within them. Niche-dependent constraints on body size are a candidate for both ecological and functional constraints because many performance variables, such as bite force, scale with body size. If body size is not limited, animals can adapt to eating harder foods by simply increasing their size but when size is niche limited, adaptation to more challenging foods requires modifying proportions (e.g., increasing the ratio of input and output lever arm lengths) to increase output force exerted at the teeth relative to the input force applied to the bone. Animals that eat hard foods, such as nut-eating squirrels and tooth-digging gophers, have powerful incisor bites for their body size (Freeman and Lemen 2008) , as do small-bodied carnivora (Christiansen and Wroe 2007) . Niche-dependent limitations on body size may restrict the optimal shape for a functionally demanding niche. Limits on body size may not be enough to increase the probability of convergence because multiple configurations of a complex lever system perform equally well; different geometries produce the same bite force, exemplifying the many-to-one relationship between morphology and performance. Additional constraints, such as the inverse relationship between bite force and gape, can further narrow the set of equally optimal morphologies because adaptations that increase one necessarily reduce the other. That particular trade-off would be most consequential for animals eating foods that are both hard and large for their body size. The combination of constraints on body size and trade-offs limits the array of foods that can be eaten and can restrict the array of feeding behaviors that exploit those foods and may also produce niche-dependent scaling relationships.",

Despite the potential importance of size and niche-dependent scaling relationships, they are typically ignored in studies that aim to explain the relationship between shape and diet. In some cases, only shape is analyzed (Perez et al. 2009; Alvarez et al. 2011) , or the relationship between size and shape is analyzed separately from that between niche and shape (Figueirido et al. 2010; Meloro et al. 2015) , or size is viewed as a confounding variable (Hautier et al. 2011; Friedman et al. 2016) controlled either by including it as a covariate in the model (Baab et al. 2014) or by analyzing residuals from a regression (Metzger and Herrel 2005; Casanovas-Vilar and van Dam 2013; Collar et al. 2014) . Omitting size from the model can lose potentially important information about adaptation because niche-dependent allometries, like niche-dependent morphologies, are evidence of ecological adaptation.",

                "text": "In this analysis, we examine size, dietary ecology, and mandibular morphology in squirrels (Sciuridae). Only one case of convergence is widely recognized in this group: bark-gouging miniatures that converge on a highly distinctive morphology as well as dietary niche (Ball and Roth 1995; Thorington and Darrow 1996; Casanovas-Vilar and van Dam 2013; Pecnerova et al. 2015; Zelditch et al. 2015) . One explanation for the infrequency of convergence is that squirrels are highly conservative because of their functionally versatile trophic morphology (Roth 2005) . That is consistent with the widespread view that squirrels are morphologically conservative, even constrained (e.g., Moore 1959; Roth 2005 ; Fabre et al. 2012; Casanovas-Vilar and van Dam 2013) and with the apparently contrary interpretations of squirrels as both specialized hard nut feeders (Cox et al. 2012) and as opportunistic generalists (Nowack 1999; Wilson and Reader 2005) . That apparent contradiction between being specialists and generalists is characteristic of functional versatility (Liem 1980; Robinson and Wilson 1998; Bellwood et al. 2006) . Many studies conclude that size accounts for little of the shape variation (Ball and Roth 1995; Thorington and Darrow 1996; Velhagen and Roth 1997; Caumul and Polly 2005; Hautier et al. 2009; Swiderski and Zelditch 2010; Casanovas-Vilar and van Dam 2013; Zelditch et al. 2015) despite the large range of body sizes (16-8000 g, Hayssen 2008 ), which could either mean that squirrels adapt to more challenging foods by increasing body size or that there are niche-dependent scaling relationships rather than a single allometric trend. Several studies have examined the relationship between squirrel trophic morphology and diet (Ball and Roth 1995; Thorington and Darrow 1996; Michaux et al. 2008; Casanovas-Vilar and van Dam 2013; Pecnerova et al. 2015) but have reached no consensus regarding that relationship and, to date, no study has used modern phylogenetic comparative methods to analyze it. In this study, we first reconstruct the evolutionary histories of diet and size, then test two hypotheses about the relationship between ecology and morphology: (1) size depends on dietary niche, and (2) jaw shape depends on both size and diet, with the effect of each being conditional on the value of the other. Finally, we examine the frequency and degree of convergence of jaw shape, testing the hypothesis that the degree of convergence is greatest in size-limited, functionally demanding dietary niches.",

Nearly all species observed in multiple seasons or multiple localities have variable diets; those that eat nuts with thick, tough shells (e.g., walnuts, Juglans) may also eat soft fruits, flowers, and buds when available, or insects, tougher buds, and bark of twigs when preferred foods are not available. Our coding scheme (Table S1 ) is based on the most challenging foods eaten by that species, taking into account its body size, because the same food item might be a large and hard object for a small-bodied species but neither large nor hard for a large-bodied species. Our coding scheme is based on both the foods that are routinely eaten or are critical fall-back foods eaten during shortages of preferred foods. Foods were divided into those requiring large bite forces at the incisors (hard nuts and seeds, cones, and the bark of large branches and boles), those that could be effectively processed by simple crushing during mastication (seeds, soft fruits, leaves, buds, terminal branches), and those that require grinding (i.e., leaves of herbaceous plants). We further divided incisor biting to distinguish gouging or plucking bark from eating nuts and cones, reasoning that bark gouging requires not only large forces but also low mechanical advantage because the animal is biting a surface outside of its mouth. We also distinguish browsers that include soft or thin-shelled nuts such as chestnuts (Castanea) or acorns (Quercus) in their diet from those that do not. Animals that eat harder nuts are classified as nut eaters even if much of their diet is less challenging because they are capable of processing hard nuts even if they rarely do so. This food type is further divided to distinguish between extremely hard nuts, such as panda nuts (Panda oleosa), and nuts of intermediate hardness (e.g., Juglans, Carya, and Corylus). Hard nuts of tropical forests, such as P. oleosa, may have husks more than 10 mm thick (Emmons 1980) , and a peak force to failure more than 13 times that of the hardest nuts of Nearctic forests (Peters 1987; Visalberghi et al. 2008) . Thus, we distinguish eight diet classes as follows: (1) nuts, (2) hard nuts, (3) bark, (4) seeds, (5) browse that does not include nuts, (6) browse that does include nuts, (7) grass, and (8) soft foods (including specialized insectivory).",

Allowing rates to vary can result in having too many parameters to estimate but the model can be fit by sampling from a heavy-tailed distribution. In the case of Brownian motion, a trait evolves by incremental changes drawn from a random distribution and the variance is finite and constant; in contrast, the variation in rates due to a mix of directional selection, stabilizing selection and random genetic drift generates a heavy-tailed distribution. Stochastic processes with variable variances and heavy tails can be modeled using stable distributions parameterized by an index of stability and the scale; the sum of several stable distributions is stable, with the same value for the stability parameter. In the case of Brownian motion, that parameter = 2; if it is <2, the distribution is shallower with heavier tails. We used StableTraits (Elliot and Mooers 2014) (available at http://www.michaelelliot.net/stabletraits.html) to reconstruct the evolution of size; two MCMC chains were run for 1,000,000 iterations and the first 10% of each was discarded as burn-in resulting in a scale reduction factor of 1.02.",

Models for size were fit using the fitContinuous function in geiger 2.06 (Harmon et al. 2008) . Models for shape were fit using the transformPhylo.ML function in the R package motmot (Thomas and Freckleton 2012) and the fitContinuousMV function kindly provided by Graham Slater. Previous analysis showed that these yield accurate estimates of shape disparity when the model fits the data (Zelditch et al. 2015) . Fitting these models requires reducing the dimensionality of the data, which can lead to inaccurate parameter estimates if too few dimensions are included in the analysis, hence, in analyses of Sciuridae, we fit the models to the first 21 PCs as a single multidimensional set. Those axes explain 99% of the variance. Similarly, in separate analyses of tree and ground squirrels we used the first 19 PCs, which explain 99% of the variance in those data. When BM did not fit the residuals, we rescaled the tree according to the parameters of the better-fitting model (invariably, OU) and refit the model to determine if, after that rescaling, the residuals meet the assumption of BM. In all cases, phylogenetic signal of the residuals from the refit model, K multi 1.00 (ranging from 1.004 to 1.02) and the best-fitting model for those residuals is BM, meeting the assumptions of the test. We used this approach rather than estimating Pagel's \u03bb (Pagel 1999) because that transform treats tips and nodes of the phylogeny differently when rescaling the tree, a procedure difficult to justify by either evolutionary or statistical theory.",

Methods that can identify convergence in the absence of a priori hypotheses exist for multivariate data (Ingram and Mahler 2013; Khabbazian et al. 2016 ) but they are not suitable for high-dimensional data because they assume that each trait has an independent rate of adaptation (\u03b1) and diffusion (\u03c3 2 ); also, including traits that lack a biological interpretation limits the ability of those methods to recover convergence (Ingram and Mahler 2013) . Such analyses could be done using principal components of shape, but those are unlikely to have independent rates of adaptation and diffusion, or a biological interpretation; they are merely the axes of a convenient coordinate system. Estimating rates of adaptation and diffusion along those axes presumes that evolution occurs along them, not within the full shape space; in contrast, distances between shapes are always measured within the full space (by the Procrustes distance), not separately along each axis. Thus, to examine convergence, we first visualized patterns of morpho-logical similarity relative to phylogenetic relationships using a tanglegram, which pairs two branching diagrams. Here, the phylogeny is one branching diagram and a phenogram produced by clustering shapes using UPGMA is the other. After a rotation to optimize the vertical matching of tips, a line is drawn for each species, connecting its positions in the two diagrams; discrepancies in those positions reveal convergence. The tanglegram was done using the cophylo function in the phytools package (Revell 2012) .",

A value of zero indicates that species have not converged at all; they are as different as members of their lineage have ever been. A value of 1 would mean that they evolved to be identical, thus values closer to 1 indicate greater evolved similarity. We did not estimate the frequencies of convergence because that requires having more putatively convergent species than variables and some diet classes have just four to six species. Because convergence is expected even in randomly evolving clades (Stayton 2008) , the degree of convergence is tested to determine whether it is any greater than expected for randomly evolving clades. The degree of convergence is compared to values obtained by simulating evolution under a model of Brownian motion. For cases in which species are inferred to converge to a significant degree, we examined the degree of similarity between them; it is possible that the putatively convergent species close up a large proportion of the distance between their lineages without closely resembling each other.

Based on these models, within tree squirrels, the most probable diet at the root is nuts (P = 0.56) and the next most probable is bark (P = 0.12). For ground squirrels, the diet at the root of the tree is more ambiguous; two diets, nuts (P = 0.34) and seeds (P = 0.35), are equally probable and browse is only slightly less so (P = 0.24). For tree squirrels, all diet transitions are equally improbable; far more probable is retaining the same diet over 10 Ma (Table 1) . For ground squirrels, the probability of retaining the same diet depends on the diet; transitions between nut eating and seed eating are only slightly less probable than retaining either of those two diets but neither nut eaters nor seed eaters are likely to switch to grazing (Table 1) . Grazing appears to be the most conservative diet in this clade and browsers are most likely to switch diets, but not preferentially to any other one. Despite the low probabilities of most diet transitions, convergent evolution of diets is common. All diets have appeared, or in the case of nuts, reappeared multiple times (Fig. 2) . Transitions away from nuts occurred early in Callosciurinae and Pteromyini and convergent returns to this diet occurred in both clades, possibly multiple times in each. Convergent returns to the nut diet also are probable for Tamias (Marmotini), more so if divergence from that diet occurred early rather than late. The diet that appears to have arisen most frequently is seed eating (excluding nuts), which arose independently in three clades of tree squirrels (Callosciurinae, Pteromyini, and Sciurini) and two clades of ground squirrels (Protoxerini and Marmotini), and multiple times in most of those clades.",

A prominent feature along this axis is the posterior extension of the angular process, on which many of the major masticatory muscles insert. Two ground foraging callosciurine taxa, (Rhinosciurus laticaudatus and Menetes berdmorei) and two flying squirrels (Belomys pearsonii and Trogopterus xanthipes) also diverge along this axis, reflecting general elongation of the mandible. All Xerini and Marmotini are distinguished from tree squirrels along this axis, even those that retain the nut and seed diets. The greatest divergence is in the grazing ground squirrels (e.g., Marmota, and the lineage including Cynomys and Spermophilus). In contrast, Protoxerini, the arboreal clade in Xerinae, cannot be distinguished from the other arboreal clades in these plots. PC2 and PC3 are relatively short and nearly equal in length, explaining 16.2 and 14.4% of the shape variation, respectively. The three smallest bark gougers have some of the lowest scores on PC2; their shorter coronoid is associated with a more robust condyloid process and ramus and a broader angular process. On PC3, the most prominent features are contrasting changes in the length of the condyloid process and breadth of the angular process; along this axis, the specialized insectivore Rhinosciurus has the most extreme scores owing to its slender mandibular processes and elongate horizontal ramus.",

We further predicted that size would play an important role in both dietary ecology and convergence because, in the absence of constraints on size, species might adapt to more challenging foods by increasing body size, but when size is limiting, species would adapt by modifying their shape. Convergence on shape would thus be most likely when dietary niches limit size and feeding function limits the optimal form for that diet niche at that given size. That reasoning presumes that the optimal size depends on diet, and the optimal shape for a given diet depends on size. Our results clearly show that in the absence of constraints on size, ecomorphological convergence is rare: we found only four cases in which dietary niches and shapes converge, and in three, size is either constrained or limiting and foods are challenging. The results of the phylogenetic Procrustes Anova offers some support for the general premise of the hypothesis, but diet explains only 40% or less of the variance in size and the model predicting shape from size, diet, and diet-dependent scaling explains, at most, only 60% of the variance in jaw shape. We also find substantial support for the hypothesis of a many-to-many mapping of shape onto dietary ecology, which may explain the most surprising result: morphological convergence without ecological convergence is as common between dietary classes as within them.",

One is the well-known convergence of mandibular morphology in bark-gouging miniatures and convergence of mandibular morphology is greatest for the small-bodied species. The similarity among these species is responsible for debates about their phylogenetic relationships and the role of miniaturization in convergence (e.g., Forsyth Major 1893; Pocock 1923; Moore 1959; Heaney 1985) . Miniaturization, in general, is not a cause of convergence in squirrels-the chipmunk-sized tree squirrels do not resemble chipmunks, and among miniatures, it is only bark gougers that converge in mandibular morphology. The second and third cases involve the large bodied to giant hard nut specialists. They occupy the most size-constrained niche, one that is also functionally demanding because powerful bites are required to open these nuts (Peters 1987) and the large size of the nuts requires powerful bites at large gapes. Hard nut eaters from three tribes (Sciurini, Protoxerini, Nannosciurini) close up nearly half the distance between their ancestral mandibular shapes, although one other (Reithrosciurus macrotis) has a notably different shape. The third case is the convergence of the protoxerine hard nut specialists on the sciurine nut eaters. In this case, body size is also important because the hard nut specialists are far larger than all but the largest sciurine nut eaters. Finally, mandibular shape of nut-eating S. davidianus converges on that of nut-eating T. striatus, a species that is only 50% of its body weight, which is the sole case in which ecomorphological convergence is not predicted by a shared size-limited or constrained niche.",

                "text": "The low frequency of ecomorphological convergence is due to the complex relationship between diet and shape, which clearly is not one-to-one. Instead, it is both one-to-many and many-toone. That it is one-to-many is suggested by the extensive morphological overlap between nut eaters and seed eaters within lineages, suggesting that the nut-and seed-eating morphology is functionally versatile, as proposed for squirrels' trophic morphology (Roth 2005) . The reason for anticipating that nut eaters and seed eaters would differ morphologically is that nut eaters should maximize incisor-bite forces whereas seed eaters should maximize molarcrushing forces. However, there need not be any trade-off between incisor-and molar-bite forces because they can be jointly maximized by shortening the diastema (and face), bringing the in- cisors closer to the molars. The many-to-one relationship between shape and diet may be due to the resultant trade-off between bite force and gape, a trade-off most consequential for species that eat foods large for their body size, such as chipmunks. To a chipmunk, an acorn is a large, hard object but chipmunks nonetheless eat them and transport them whole in their cheek pouches. Chipmunks must therefore fit whole acorns in their mouths even when their cheek pouches are filled with seeds and must later be able to bite through the shells of those same acorns. Compared to tree squirrels, chipmunks' jaw adductor muscles have low mechanical advantages, although reliable estimates for chipmunks are limited to a single species, T. striatus (Velhagen and Roth 1997; Casanovas-Vilar and van Dam 2013) . Chipmunks and other small-bodied species may not maximize feeding efficiency; instead caching large or well-protected items more often than larger-bodied species do (Ivan and Swihart 2000) . Adaptations that increase bite force at the expense of gape could compromise foraging efficiency. Feeding efficiency clearly does matter when foods are extremely well protected or cannot be transported or stored, which may explain convergence among hard nut eaters and among bark gougers. Hard nuts eaten by squirrels are so well protected that most animals that eat them are much larger than squirrels, such as elephants, ruminants, and African brush-tailed porcupines, Atherurus africanus (Gautier-Hion et al. 1985) and some larger animals also use tools, such as the hammers and anvils fashioned by chimpanzees and capuchin monkeys (Boesch and Boesch 1983; Visalberghi et al. 2007) . Trees gouged by bark gougers obviously cannot be transported. Feeding efficiency may explain the most specialized and divergent trophic morphology in squirrels, that of the insectivore (Rhinosciurus laticaudatus). This species ,  Table 4 . Degree of convergence (C1), the probability that the degree of convergence exceeds what would be expected from a randomly evolving lineage (P), and the range of Procrustes distances between convergent species (ProcD) for cases of statistically significant convergence. commonly known as the shrew-faced squirrel, may actually be the most remarkable case of convergence in the lineage though it converges not on another sciurid but rather on insectivorous treeshrews (Scandentia: Tupaiidae). What convergence on morphologies that maximize feeding or foraging efficiency cannot explain is the convergence of arboreal browsing protoxerines and small-bodied, nut-eating flying squirrels. This case is surprising because browsers typically eat softer foods than nuts and they are larger bodied than the nut eaters. They are thus presumably capable of generating more powerful bites than the species that eat harder foods. The even odder case is convergence among grazing and nut-eating marmotines. The convergence of two grazers is not surprising but the convergence of a grazer and a nut eater is surprising in light of evidence of a trade-off between nut-eating and grazing performance (Cox and Jeffery 2011) . However, that evidence comes from a comparison between animals with divergent trophic anatomy (a nut-eating sciuromorphic squirrel and a grazing hystricomorphic guinea pig), leaving open the question of whether there are trade-offs between nut eating and grazing performance given a common trophic anatomy. When the relationship between ecology and function is many-to-many, and when trophic morphology may be optimized for different functions, diet is not likely to be a good predictor of jaw shape. In that context, it is surprising that our model predicts shape as well as it does. However, that is only because we included size as part of the ecological model for shape. This may be unconventional in studies that examine the relationship between trophic morphology and diet by phylogenetically informed comparative methods, but size and scaling relationships have long been a major focus of functional morphology. One study directly quantified morphological correlates of bite force, finding that, in phyllostomid bats, size explains approximately 74% of the variation in bite force, and species with stronger bites than expected for their size have a shorter rostrum and mandible and more developed muscle attachment areas (Nogueira et al. 2009) . Not surprisingly, we also find that tree squirrels, which have stronger bites than expected for their size (Freeman and Lemen, 2008) , have a relatively short, robust ramus or diastema and well-developed angular process. Bark gougers too have a robust ramus, broad angular process and robust condyloid process but the smallest miniatures have nearly no coronoid process. We expected that scaling relationships would vary across diets, and given the statistical support for that hypothesis, it would be useful to characterize the diet-dependent scaling relationships; when functional equivalence of jaws is maintained by geometric scaling, allometry indicates that species in that diet class are not maintaining functional equivalence across their range of body sizes.",

Studies of cranial and mandibular morphology also find frequent convergence, to a remarkably high degree, especially between boas and pythons (Esquerre and Scott Keogh 2016) and across iterated radiations of damselfishes (Frederich et al. 2013) as well as consistent ecomorphological convergence to specialized planktivory in surgeonfishes (Friedman et al. 2016) . The pattern we find in squirrels more closely resembles the pattern found in reef fishes (Bellwood et al., 2006) : broad morphological overlap among some dietary classes, and a distinctive shape for other classes, albeit with extreme shapes in a few specialized classes. In both these groups the broad overlap may be due to functional versatility. However, these studies use different methodologies and rely on diverse types of data (e.g., shape vs non-shape; high vs low dimensionality data) that makes comparisons between studies difficult, and what constitutes convergence may even vary between studies. In particular, it is difficult to say whether the low degree of convergence we find in squirrel mandibular morphology is simply typical of high-dimensional shape data (where convergence is inherently less likely) or due to functional versatility and the many-to-many relationships between shape, function, and ecology.",

We found few such cases but there may be more than we detected because our method requires identifying convergent species prior to conducting the tests. At present, there is no method for automatically detecting convergence in high-dimensional data hence we may have overlooked other cases of morphological without ecological convergence. Another limitation of the present study is that data on the diets of many squirrels are sparse aside from a wealth of detail on several west African protoxerines (Emmons 1980) , diurnal Malaysian squirrels (Harrison 1962; MacKinnon 1978; Payne 1980) , and the North American species used to test theories of optimal foraging (Lewis 1980; Belovsky 1986; Ritchie 1991; Thomas and Weigl 1998) and mechanisms of coexistence (Ackerman and Weigl 1970; Brown and Batzli 1984; Dyni and Yensen 1996; Kotler and Brown 1999) . More complete ecological information might reveal more cases of morphological without ecological convergence or add to the evidence for functional versatility.",

But it is no less difficult to reconcile rare ecomorphological convergence with the idea that historical contingency overrides ecological selection. The difference between commonly replicated morphologies, on one hand, and rarely but unexpectedly replicated outcomes on the other is due to the structure of their adaptive landscapes. Convergence will be most common when the relationship between ecology and form is one-to-one, yielding one optimum per niche. When adaptive landscapes are instead characterized by a many-toone relationship between form and function, there may be multiple equally optimal morphologies (Hulsey and Wainwright 2002; Alfaro et al. 2004; Alfaro et al. 2005; Swiderski and Zelditch 2010) , and when it is characterized by a one-to-many relation-ship between form and ecology there may be one ecologically and functionally versatile optimum (Roth 2005; Bellwood et al. 2006) . The structure of the adaptive landscape can be further complicated by a many-to-many relationship between ecology and function because that could result in more than one adaptive peak for some ecological classes and less than one for others. The combination of one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many relationships gives a complex structure to adaptive landscapes. On complex adaptive landscapes, ecological selection can yield different outcomes; replicated outcomes are, therefore, predictably rare.",
