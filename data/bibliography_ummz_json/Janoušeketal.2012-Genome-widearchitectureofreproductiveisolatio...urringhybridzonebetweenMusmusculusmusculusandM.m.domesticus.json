    "abstract": "Studies of a hybrid zone between two house mouse subspecies (Mus musculus musculus and M. m. domesticus) along with studies using laboratory crosses reveal a large role for the X chromosome and multiple autosomal regions in reproductive isolation as a consequence of disrupted epistasis in hybrids. One limitation of previous work has been that most of the identified genomic regions have been large. The goal here is to detect and characterize precise genomic regions underlying reproductive isolation. We surveyed 1401 markers evenly spaced across the genome in 679 mice collected from two different transects. Comparisons between transects provide a means for identifying common patterns that likely reflect intrinsic incompatibilities. We used a genomic cline approach to identify patterns that correspond to epistasis. From both transects, we identified contiguous regions on the X chromosome in which markers were inferred to be involved in epistatic interactions. We then searched for autosomal regions showing the same patterns and found they constitute about 5% of autosomal markers. We discovered substantial overlap between these candidate regions underlying reproductive isolation and QTL for hybrid sterility identified in laboratory crosses. Analysis of gene content in these regions suggests a key role for several mechanisms, including the regulation of transcription, sexual conflict and sexual selection operating at both the postmating prezygotic and postzygotic stages of reproductive isolation. Taken together, these results indicate that speciation in two recently diverged (c. 0.5 Ma) house mouse subspecies is complex, involving many genes dispersed throughout the genome and associated with distinct functions.",

                "text": "A crucial step in speciation according to the biological species concept (Dobzhansky 1937; Mayr 1942 ) is the formation of reproductive barriers between emerging independently evolving lineages. Postzygotic reproductive barriers such as hybrid sterility and inviability are often caused by Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities (BDMIs) (Bateson 1909; Dobzhansky 1936; Muller 1940 Muller , 1942 Coyne & Orr 2004 ). The BDMI model is based on the accumulation of mutations in allopatric populations that cause incompatibilities between interacting genes in hybrid genomes when the populations come together. Another common phenomenon associated with postzygotic isolation is the observation that the X chromosome plays a disproportionately large role in hybrid sterility, termed the large X-effect (Charlesworth et al. 1987; Coyne & Orr 1989; Masly & Presgraves 2007) . The large X-effect seems to be a consequence of a higher density of BDMIs on the X chromosome than on the autosomes, although the underlying cause of this higher density is still unclear and may be due to faster evolution of the X, sex-ratio meiotic drive or the disruption of gene regulation on the X during spermatogenesis (Presgraves 2008) . BDMIs between the X chromosome and the autosomes also provide an explanation for Haldane's rule (Muller 1940 (Muller , 1942 Turelli & Orr 1995; Zeng 1996) , a phenomenon whereby the heterogametic sex is the sex that suffers from reduced viability or fertility in hybrid genomes (Haldane 1922; Orr 1997 ). Haldane's rule together with the large X-effect may apply more generally to taxa with differentiated sex chromosomes (Coyne & Orr 2004) .",

In addition, Good et al. (2008b) and White et al. (2011) identified more proximal parts of the X chromosome as contributing to hybrid male sterility. Moreover, the data of Good et al.

It has been known for a long time that chromosome 17 harbours gene(s) involved in hybrid male sterility (Forejt & Iv\u00e1nyi 1974; Forejt 1996; Vysko\u010dilov\u00e1 et al. 2005 Vysko\u010dilov\u00e1 et al. , 2009 White et al. 2011) , and the first hybrid sterility gene (Prdm9) was positionally cloned to the proximal part of chromosome 17 (Mihola et al. 2009) . However, it is clear from mapping studies that other autosomes also contribute to hybrid sterility (Oka et al. 2007; White et al. 2011) . In addition, consomic strains carrying each Mus musculus musculus chromosome on a largely M. m. domesticus background showed reduced fertility for nearly every autosome (Gregorov\u00e1 et al. 2008) . Although the male and female effects of fertility were not explored separately in this study, the consomic strains demonstrate that genes underlying hybrid sterility map to most autosomes. The genetic basis of hybrid sterility in mice is clearly complex, and laboratory crosses may be inefficient in identifying specific genes because the genomic regions identified in mapping studies tend to be quite large (Storchov\u00e1 et al. 2004; Good et al. 2008a; Vysko\u010dilov\u00e1 et al. 2009; White et al. 2011) .",

Barton & Hewitt (1985) argued that most naturally occurring hybrid zones are tension zones maintained by the dispersal of parental types and selection against hybrids as a result of incompatibilities between co-adapted parental genomes. From multilocus cline theory (Barton 1983; Barton & Gale 1993) , it is known that unless the strength of selection (s) exceeds the rate of recombination (r) between loci (described by the coupling coefficient: h = s \u2044 r), different parts of chromosomes behave partially independently enabling neutral loci to escape the influence of loci under selection, thus making it possible to distinguish regions associated with negatively selected reproductive barriers from neutral regions. In instances where hybrids represent complex mosaics of parental genomes because of multigenerational backcrossing and intercrossing, it is possible to distinguish regions under selection on a much finer scale than is possible with laboratory crosses (Rieseberg & Buerkle 2002; Buerkle & Lexer 2008; Payseur 2010; White et al. 2011; .",

Recently, hybrid mice have been reported also from Norway (Jones et al. 2010) . The house mouse hybrid zone is a tension zone as suggested by Barton & Hewitt (1985) and confirmed by others (Payseur et al. 2004; Raufaste et al. 2005; Machol\u00e1n et al. 2007) . Reduced fertility of hybrid males probably plays the most important role in maintaining the tension zone as it has been demonstrated in laboratory crosses (Forejt & Iv\u00e1nyi 1974; Forejt 1996; Storchov\u00e1 et al. 2004; Britton-Davidian et al. 2005; Vysko\u010dilov\u00e1 et al. 2005 Vysko\u010dilov\u00e1 et al. , 2009 Good et al. 2008a Good et al. ,b, 2010 Mihola et al. 2009; White et al. 2011) and was recently reported directly from the centre of the hybrid zone (Turner et al. 2012) . In addition, increased parasite loads in hybrids have been suggested (Sage et al. 1986; Moulia et al. 1993) ; however, recently, the opposite has been reported from a different part of the hybrid zone Gouy de Bellocq et al. 2012) . Also, hybrid female sterility has been proposed to contribute to hybrid failure (Britton-Davidian et al. 2005) .",

Teeter et al. (2008) found some autosomal regions to be potentially contributing to reproductive isolation, including a few that are in linkage disequilibrium with X-linked markers.

One transect is located in southern Bavaria and Austria (BV), and the second transect is located 200 km to the north in Bavaria and the Czech Republic (CZ). By comparing the patterns of introgression in two transects, we identified common patterns that are likely to reflect intrinsic genetic incompatibilities. We surveyed 1401 SNP markers (Wang et al. 2011) across the genome and analysed these data using a genomic cline approach (Gompert & Buerkle 2009 , 2010 . This approach compares individual loci to the average pattern for all loci and assesses whether loci are neutral or under selection. Here, we focus on those loci inferred to be involved in epistasis based on their non-neutral patterns of introgression, following Gompert & Buerkle (2009) . First, we compared introgression patterns between pairs of markers on the X chromosome and identified adjacent markers with similar epistatic patterns of introgression in both transects. We then compared these regions with autosomal markers to identify candidate BDMIs. We found that these regions harbour genes involved in a number of distinct processes including transcriptional regulation, sexual conflict and sexual selection.",

The analysis uses a multinomial regression approach to characterize the behaviour of genetic markers along a genomic admixture gradient represented by individual hybrid index scores estimated using a previously published method (Buerkle 2005) . The behaviour of a marker is represented as a probability of observing a particular genotype given the hybrid index (Gompert & Buerkle 2009 , 2010 and the likelihood of this model is compared to the likelihood of observing the data under a neutral model. Following Gompert & Buerkle (2009) , four alternative patterns of selection are considered including overdominance (in which heterozygous genotypes are observed more than expected), underdominance (in which heterozygous genotypes are observed less than expected), directional selection (in which individual clines are shifted relative to the genome average) or epistasis (defined in this context as interactions between a single locus and the genomic background and characterized by steep homozygote clines and high and sharp heterozygote clines). Here, we focus particularly on those loci inferred to be involved in epistatic interactions. Hybrid indexes were based on 1316 autosomal loci (Wang et al. 2011) . To obtain P-values estimates, the data were permuted 1000 times. The two significance levels (P introgress \u00a3 0.01 and P introgress \u00a3 0.001) were used to distinguish markers with patterns significantly differ from the neutral prediction.",

When log-likelihood ratios were plotted against physical map position, a distinct pattern of introgression emerged (Fig. 2a ). The whole X chromosome was partitioned into several large regions, interestingly, in a similar way in both transects. The only difference was found to be in the degree of independence these regions exhibited across the length of the chromosome. Chromosomal regions in the BV transect introgressed in a more similar way than in the CZ transect. To find regions along the X with similar patterns of introgression, XURs were defined. They are represented by adjacent markers with a homogeneous pattern of introgression for which the log-likelihood ratio between them did not exceed the sampling error (P-value >0.01) (Figs 2b and 3 ). These included 19 and 16 XURs in the BV and the CZ transects, respectively (Fig. 3 , Table S1a ,b, Supporting information). The sizes of XURs varied from 0.7 to 17.0 Mb in the BV transect and from 1.4 to 14 Mb in the CZ transect and they included from 2 to 9 (BV) and 2 to 8 (CZ) SNP markers, respectively. Almost all of the markers from within XURs exhibited introgression patterns significantly deviated from neutral prediction as provided by the Introgress program (Gompert & Buerkle 2009) . The only exceptions were XUR 2 and 3 in the CZ transect. Assuming a common reproductive basis for these patterns across hybrid populations, we then identified overlapping XURs between transects, defining them as SXURs. We identified 10 SXURs comprising 29 X-linked markers (Fig. 3 , Table 1 ). The identified SXURs were based on the overlap between transect-specific XURs. The size of these groups ranged from 1.2 to 10.1 Mb and included from 2 to 5 markers.",

The first group included terms involved in DNA binding and regulation of transcription. The group was represented by several related terms (GO:0003700, GO:0003677, GO:0003676, GO:0043565, GO:0016779).

Given our concerns that differences in hybrid zone movement between these transects (Wang et al. 2011) might obscure similarities between transects, we devised a method that does not rely on a direct comparison of introgression models between transects. We assessed the introgression along the X chromosome to identify regions exhibiting epistasis in both transects. Markers from these regions were subsequently used to reveal autosomal markers under putative epistasis common to both transects. In general, genotypic patterns across a hybrid zone may be due to various forces including selection acting on intrinsic incompatibilities, selection in particular environments, drift, migration or demographic processes such as local extinction or colonization of populations across the landscape. Many of these processes may operate differently in different transects. Thus, comparisons of 'signatures of selection' among transects provide one means of distinguishing selection that is owing to intrinsic incompatibilities from selection that may be specific to a particular environment or false positives that may result from stochastic processes. We argue that common pattern of epistasis (as defined by Gompert & Buerkle 2009) observed in both transects is caused by selection against intrinsic incompatibilities responsible for reproductive isolation.",

                "text": "The identified regions common in both transects were detected in the central and distal portions of the X chromosome. This is in accord with previous findings from the hybrid zone as well as from laboratory crosses. Payseur et al. (2004) , Machol\u00e1n et al. (2011) and Dufkov\u00e1 et al. (2011) identified reduced gene flow in a central portion of the X chromosome in the BV and the CZ transects, respectively. In addition, laboratory crosses between wild-derived inbred strains suggested several loci along the X chromosome are associated with various sterility phenotypes. Recently, lowered testis weight, smaller sperm counts and reduced sperm velocity have been reported from the hybrid zone (Turner et al. 2012) . Storchov\u00e1 et al. (2004) and Vysko\u010dilov\u00e1 et al. (2009) found the central portion of the X to be associated with testis weight as well as sperm count phenotypes. In this part of the X, approximately between 60 and 80 Mb, Storchov\u00e1 et al. (2004) obtained the strongest signal. This region corresponds to five of the SXURs (1, 2, 3, 4 and 5) identified in our study (Fig. 3) . Oka et al. (2004) also implicated the central portion of the X. However, in their study, this region was associated with a sperm head morphology phenotype. Recently, Good et al. (2011) reported five candidate genes potentially involved in reproductive isolation from the central portion of the X chromosome. All are involved in male reproduction, and all have elevated rates of evolution. However, only two of them overlapped with regions we identified in the hybrid zone (SXUR 4: Pbsn and SXUR 5: Tsga8). The distal part of the X was found to be associated with either testis weight (Storchov\u00e1 et al. 2004) or testis weight and sperm counts (Oka et al. 2004; Vysko\u010dilov\u00e1 et al. 2009) . We identified two large regions comprising three (6, 7 and 8) and two (9 and 10) SXURs, respectively, which correspond with these previous findings. However, some recent studies found that the proximal part of the X is associated with testis weight and \u2044 or sperm counts, while the central and distal parts are associated with sperm head morphology (Good et al. 2008b; White et al. 2011) . This discrepancy might be due to the fact that these studies crossed different inbred strains. Because M. m. musculus and M. m. domesticus have been isolated for only a short time (c. 0.5 Ma), alleles associated with reproductive isolation may not be fixed across populations. This was shown by Vysko\u010dilov\u00e1 et al. (2005 Vysko\u010dilov\u00e1 et al. ( , 2009 who found a polymorphism in hybrid sterility in M. m. musculus populations. The fact that some wild-derived inbred strains are mosaics of M. m. musculus and M. m. domesticus genomes (Yang et al. 2011) might also contribute to the discrepancy in results between various crosses. Alternatively, all of these studies may be limited by their inability to precisely map the QTL of interest.",

We were particularly interested in which GO biological processes and molecular functions were associated with genes from within these regions. Among all enriched categories, one of the most important findings was the involvement of a group of genes associated with DNA binding, transcription and its regulation, thus emphasizing the role of between-loci interactions (e.g. transcription factors) as suggested by the BDMIs. A second group involved genes with peptidase inhibitory activity that was recently related to sexual conflict and sexual selection in the female reproductive tract (Dean et al. 2008 (Dean et al. , 2011 Dorus et al. 2010) . Interestingly, three out of four rapidly evolving genes (Serpine2, Spink3, Spinkl) identified in the seminal vesicles and subsequently referenced to proteolytic inhibitory activity by , fall into epistatically interacting regions. Other studies found proteolytic inhibitory activity enriched in rapidly evolving genes functioning mostly on the outer surface of sperm (Dorus et al. 2010; Dean et al. 2011) . Thus, these observations are consistent with a role for sexual conflict in reproductive isolation. The next GO term, chemotaxis, was enriched in the overlap of the two transects. The ability of sperm to find their way through the female reproductive tract is key to successful reproduction (Clark et al. 2006) . From this perspective, chemotaxis may play a very important role in reproduction and may be under strong selection as well. The selective force operating at this stage may be sperm competition when females undergo multiple mating (Dean et al. 2006; Dean & Nachman 2009) .",

                "text": "Several studies focused on the association of hybrid sterility phenotypes with particular markers in the genome using QTL analysis (Mihola et al. 2009; Vysko\u010dilov\u00e1 et al. 2009; White et al. 2011) . White et al. (2011) recently mapped traits underlying hybrid male sterility in a large F2 mapping population. In general, the identified QTL were in wide genomic intervals. Nonetheless, the results of White et al. (2011) provide a useful comparison to the present study, because similar hybrid male sterility phenotypes are observed in the hybrid zone (Turner et al. 2012) . Several markers identified in overlapping regions between the two transects were found to fall within five QTL regions associated with relative testis weight or sperm density phenotypes (2-74558017, 2-118591908, 4-103390028, 17-14320574 and 17-65932862) . Other markers (3-74249497, 5-139601762, 7-16643634, 8-77982361, 8-95400455, 8-96505302, 11-46639287, 15-42990323 and 16-74152290) fall within nine QTL regions associated with sperm morphology. Although QTL regions sometimes span large portions of a chromosome making an assessment on the overlap with our data difficult, for certain cases, the overlap is very precise and \u2044 or markers identified reside very close to regions with the highest likelihood (4-103390028, 5-139601762, 7-16643634, 8-77982361, 8-95400455, 8-96505302, 16-74152290) . Although an autosomal region involved in hybrid male sterility was found to be on chromosome 17 (Forejt & Iv\u00e1nyi 1974; Forejt 1996) and, recently, a particular gene (Prdm9-Chr17:15682083-15701318) was identified (Mihola et al. 2009) , we found no correspondence with our data from the hybrid zone. This is in contrast to Vysko\u010dilov\u00e1 et al. (2009) and White et al. (2011) who found an association between the proximal portion of chromosome 17 and sperm counts and relative testis weight. Given the large span of this QTL in both studies, it is possible that a different region (i.e. marker 17-14320574) is involved.",

These findings, together with information that epistatically interacting loci are distributed throughout the genome, provide strong evidence that reproductive isolation in emerging house mouse species is polygenic, complex and likely resulted from the accumulation of incompatibilities between M. m. musculus and M. m. domesticus during the relatively short time period in which these populations diverged in allopatry.",
