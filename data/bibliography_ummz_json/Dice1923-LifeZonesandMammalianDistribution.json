This material is of no little value as it demonstrates the futility of trying to conduct bait efficiency tests during the spring of the year, when the killing efficiency of the bait is determined by whether the hole is left open or closed. Under the conditions as described, should one or more pocket gophers be killed there may still be others left to close the opening made into the run, thus seeming to indicate that no kill has been made, and in this way leading to wrong conclusions. However, the data set forth in the fore part demonstrate clearly that Thomomys townsendi, in the Snake River valley of Malheur County, Oregon, has at least two litters a year, and that these are born in close succession.",

However, it is seldom that any statement is made as to how largely climatic data have been employed in the construction of these life zone maps and how much the maps are dependent upon faunal considerations, or upon certain biologic indicators. In the absence of these data no critical comparison can be made of the climatic conditions and the faunas or floras of the areas mapped. These maps, therefore, are practically useless in any critical attempt to determine the factors limiting either the distribution of particular forms or of larger groupsP It is apparent that the life zones as mapped for Alabama are based to a considerable degree on the belief that the distribution of life must correspond with temperature belts, and it is further evident that in the absence of direct temperature data for parts of the state the limits of the several zones are based to a considerable extent on topographic contours.",
