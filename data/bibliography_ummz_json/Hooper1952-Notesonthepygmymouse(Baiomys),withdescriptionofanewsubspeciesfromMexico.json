To judge from . our collections, however, there is a great disparity in population sizes of each species in those areas. The series from San Gabriel contains one specimen of taylori and 33 examples of musculus. In the sample from La Resolana the ratio is 25 taylori to 6 musculus and in that f~om Ameca 35 taylori to 6 musculus.

Length of hind foot and length of ear are useful in identifying single individuals, but neither of those measurements alone is always absolutely diagnostic. In combination they identify almost all of the specimens at hand (Fig. 1) , which includes both young and old individuals of each species. Size of the cranium is particularly diagnostic. The specimens of musculus are larger than those of laylori.

In addition to the usual variations which appear to be related to wear and to pelage replacement there are two Barts of variations which warrant especial mention. One pertains to white spotting or flecking on the upper parts, the other to intensity of pigmentation. In almost every sample of five or more specimens the upper parts of some individuals are flecked with white. In these small white areas the hairs are entirely white, apparently devoid of pigment. These white hairs may represent regrowth over an injured spot. Their cause is yet unexplained. Also in most samples there are a few individuals that are strikingly paler or darker than the average of their sample. These extremes do not appear to represent color phases of the sort seen in Peromyscus (Blair, Contrib. Lab. Vert. Genetics Univ. Mich., No. 35, 1947) . Buffy orange pigments, absent in the gray phase of Peromyscus, appear to be present in both dark and pale specimens of Baiomys musculus. A principal difference between the extremes appears to be in intensity of all pigments-the buffy orange and the blackish-in both the cover and guard hairs. Multiple factors that affect intensity of pigmentation could account for the light and dark extremes and the essentially complete series of intermediate stages represented in the samples. Pelage coloration in BaiomY8 musculus varies geographically, as pointed out by Osgood (op. cit.) . When the samples at hand from Mexico are arranged geographically on the laboratory table, I divide them into 4 groups on the basis of coloration. ThEi most intensely pigmented specimens are from the coastal strip of southern Chiapas (Mapastepec and Pijijiapan) and from the mountains of eastern Chiapas (Las Margaritas). These apparently are typical of the race nigrescens. They are characterized by dark reddish brown upper parts. The long basal bands of the hairs are plumbeous black. The underparts are pale pinkjsh-buff i the buffy tips of the hairs do not obscure the plumbeous basal parts. The ears are fuscous. The tail is blackish and monocolor. The upper surfaces of the forefeet and hind feet are lightly or strongly dusky. The most intensely pigmented individuals are predominantly sooty dorsally. In the juvenal pelage the upper parts are blackish and the underparts are dull plumbeous, lightly washed with white or cinnamon.",

In the present, material there is basis for the recognition of three geographic races: (1) The deeply pigmented, moderately small nigrescens which inhabits the southern coastal and eastern parts of Chiapas. In western Chiapas and eastern Oaxaca it grades into (2) the paler form musculus which apparently is significantly larger than nigrescens in the northwestern part of its range, but not in its northeastern or southern parts. In the series at hand I refer the specimens from eastern Oaxaca, (Reforma) and all localities in Chiapas to nigrescens.

Upper surfaces of feet white, not faintly or strongly dusky; tail bicolor, not monocolor. B. m. brunneus is said to be darker and more brownish dorsally than is musculus and is' reported to have somewhat shorter nasals than that race (Osgood, op. cit.). In the samples at hand the nasals of infernatis are not significantly shorter than those of musculus. More~ over the samples of injeroatis are distinctly paler dorsally than are those of musculus.
