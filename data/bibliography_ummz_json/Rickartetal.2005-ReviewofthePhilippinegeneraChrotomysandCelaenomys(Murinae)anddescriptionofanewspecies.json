    "abstract": "The murine genera Celaenomys and Chrotomys comprise a group of semifossorial, vermivorous rodents endemic to the Philippines. Analysis of variation within this group supports the recognition of 4 named species occurring on the large islands of Luzon and Mindoro, as well as our description of a 5th species from Sibuyan, a small island in the central Philippines that has remained isolated from the other islands by deep water channels. Examination of cytochrome-b gene sequence data from 4 of the 5 taxa indicates that Celaenomys silaceus may be basal and sister to the other taxa but morphological and chromosomal data do not support the recognition of Celaenomys as a separate genus. Analysis of the sequence data indicates a relatively early separation of the Sibuyan species and a later split between 2 species of Chrotomys on Luzon. Diversification of Chrotomys appears to have involved speciation associated with both habitat vicariance on Luzon and overwater dispersal to neighboring islands. Most of the members of this clade are restricted to mid-or high-elevation forests, have limited geographic ranges within the archipelago, and some may be imperiled due to loss of natural habitat.",

Celaenomys includes 1 species, C. silaceus, from northern Luzon. Chrotomys includes 3 named species: C. whiteheadi from northern Luzon; C. mindorensis, which occurs in central Luzon and on Mindoro; and C. gonzalesi from Mt. Isarog in southeastern Luzon. In 1992 a specimen of Chrotomys was obtained from Sibuyan, a small (ca. 460-km 2 ) island in the central Philippines (Goodman and Ingle 1993; Fig. 1 ). Our preliminary examination revealed that this specimen represents a previously undescribed species of Chrotomys (Heaney et al. 1998) .",

For the parsimony analysis, all characters were treated as unordered and equally weighted; all parsimony tree searches were exhaustive. The best-fit model for likelihood analysis was determined by evaluating the fit of various substitution models on a neighborjoining tree and applying sequential likelihood ratio tests as implemented in Modeltest (Posada and Crandall 1998). Once the best-fit Lightly shaded areas show 120-m current water depth, indicating approximate limits of late Pleistocene islands (Heaney 1986) . model was chosen, we used an additional likelihood ratio test to evaluate whether a molecular clock could be enforced. The parameters describing this best-fit model were used in a branch-and-bound tree search as implemented in PAUP*. Bootstrap values (Felsenstein 1985) were calculated under the maximum-likelihood criterion by using 100 pseudoreplicates with heuristic searches employed within each replicate (tree bisection and reconstruction branch swapping on a starting tree obtained via neighbor joining).",

                "text": "Remarks.-This species was described by Thomas (1895, 1898) based on 2 specimens obtained from Mt. Data in northern Luzon. Thomas (1895) provisionally referred it to the Australian hydromyine genus Xeromys based on the reduced number of molars, but subsequently placed it in the new genus Celaenomys as a close ally of Chrotomys (Thomas 1898) . The loss of the 3rd molar was considered by Thomas (1898) as the principal defining trait of Celaenomys. Corbet and Hill (1992) placed this species within Chrotomys because the absence of the 3rd molar was not a consistent character and therefore was insufficient for generic separation. Guy Musser (pers. comm.) also considers Celaenomys to be a synonym of Chrotomys based on a large number of shared-derived morphological characters that distinguish these taxa from all other Philippine murines (Musser and Heaney 1992) . Our results support this arrangement. Although the cytochrome-b sequence data place silaceus in a basal position relative to the other species (Fig. 3) , phenetic analyses show that silaceus is no more distinctive than the Sibuyan species (Fig. 2) . The morphological features that distinguish silaceus from the other species are primarily differences of degree and do not warrant recognition of Celaenomys as a separate genus. This species is distinguished from congeners by its smaller body size; pelage that is short, dense, and brownish gray or silvery gray without prominent dorsal stripes (although some specimens have a small pale ''blaze'' on the forehead or a faint pale line between the shoulders); narrower, more delicate skull; auditory bullae that are separated from, rather than tightly attached to, the squamosal and alisphenoid bones; and greater reduction of the molars including the loss of the 3rd molar in most specimens (Table 1 ; Appendix II; Musser and Heaney 1992). The standard karyotype (based on 1 specimen) is indistinguishable from that of C. gonzalesi .",

The nasals are rounded laterally, imparting a tubular form to the anterior rostrum. The dorsal profile of the skull is nearly straight, from the nasal tips to the braincase, with only the slightest convexity over the expanded frontals. The braincase has a smoothly rounded profile. There is an abrupt transition to the relatively flat, vertical occiput, although the surface is smooth and there is no medial lambdoidal ridge. In contrast, the occipital regions of the other species are more inflated and posterior skull profiles are rounded. In all species of Chrotomys, the zygomatic arch is strongly built and relative positions of the anterior and posterior zygomatic roots are similar. The zygomatic plate, although broad in all species, is substantially narrower in C. sibuyanensis (Appendix II). The new species has a moderate sqamosal-mastoid foramen. This opening also is found in most specimens of C. silaceus, but not in the other species. The mastoid is inflated, and there is a foramen on the dorsal margin near the occipital. The auditory bulla is small, as in other members of the genus, and is tightly attached to the cranium. As in congeners, a lateral strut of the alisphenoid partially encloses the alisphenoid canal.",

In the other species of Chrotomys, an elongate interpremaxillary foramen is located immediately posterior to incisor alveoli (Fig. 6 ) and, although variable in size and shape, this is a prominent opening in all specimens that we have examined. In contrast, this opening is not present in the single example of the new species but is replaced by a pair of minute foramina. In all species, the incisive foramina are short and broad in comparison to other murines. However, these openings are relatively longer in C. sibuyanensis than in the other taxa ( Fig. 6; Appendix II) . As in the other species of Chrotomys (except for those specimens of C. silaceus that lack 3rd molars), the palate is short and does not extend to the end of the molar tooth row. Shallow palatal grooves extend from the posterior margins of the incisive foramina to the posterior end of the palate. The postpalatine foramina are located within the grooves at a position between the 1st and 2nd molars. The mesopterygoid fossa is narrow compared to those of congeners, and the sphenopalatine vacuities in the dorsolateral walls are larger. The lateral pterygoid fossae are narrow and shallow, and each contains a small sphenopterygoid vacuity on the dorsomedial surface. The posterior margin of each pterygoid plate is separated from the auditory bulla by a narrow middle lacerate foramen. As in the other species of Chrotomys, there is a large stapedial foramen on the posteromedial margin of the bulla that receives the stapedial artery, and the lateral margin of the pterygoid plate has a groove for the interorbital branch of this artery, which passes from the bulla to the orbit. This is the common (and presumably primitive) pattern of cephalic arterial circulation for murines (Musser and Heaney 1992) .",

The lower incisors are long and slender with rounded anterior faces, thick enamel, and wearing to sharp, awl-shaped tips (Figs. 5 and 6; Musser and Heaney 1992:79, figure 46) . Enamel on both upper and lower incisors is pale ivory colored. The holotype of C. sibuyanensis is an adult with relatively unworn molars (Fig. 7) . The molar tooth row is substantially shorter than those of congeners with the exception of C. silaceus ( Fig. 6; Appendix II) . In all taxa, the upper and lower 3rd molars are reduced (or absent in most specimens of C. silaceus). However, the 3rd molars are relatively larger in C. sibuyanensis. Cusp patterns on the upper molars are similar in all taxa, and are simplified through the loss or fusion of labial cusps t3, t6, and t9 on the 1st and 2nd molars (Musser and Heaney 1992) . Lower molars also have simplified crowns due to the fusion of primary cusps and the loss of secondary labial cusplets. On the 1st lower molar, the anteroconid consists of partially fused anterolabial and anterolingual cusps that are merged (respectively) with the protoconid and metaconid to form a ringed basin comprising the anterior half of the tooth. The posterior portion of the crown consists of a 2nd basinlike lamina formed from the fused hypoconid and entoconid. The crown of the 2nd lower molar includes 2 smaller basinlike laminae (involving the protoconidmetaconid, and the hypoconid-entoconid), whereas the 3rd lower molar includes a small anterior lamina (protoconidmetaconid) and a posterior protuberance (fused hypoconidentoconid). The 1st lower molar has a posterior cingulum, which, compared to those of the other taxa, is larger and located more medially on the posterior margin of the tooth. The 2nd lower molar also bears a posterior cingulum, a feature that is either absent or much reduced in the other taxa ( Fig. 7 ; Musser et al. 1982:520, figure 4; Musser and Heaney 1992: 80, figure 47) .",

Dominant vegetation at the type locality included climbing bamboo (Schizostachyum) and a gymnosperm tree (Podocarpus). The understory consisted primarily of creeping pandan (Freycinetia). Abundant epiphytes included moss, ferns, orchids, and pitcher plants (Nepenthes). Other murines trapped at the type locality included an undescribed species of Apomys and an undescribed species allied with Rattus or Tarsomys (Goodman and Ingle 1993; Heaney et al. 1998; G. Musser, pers. comm.) . The holotype of C. sibuyanensis was captured in a snap trap placed on the ground in a tunnellike runway formed by bamboo leaves overlaying creeping pandans. The animal was oriented sideways in the trap in a position indicating that it probably was not attracted to the bait, which consisted of roasted coconut coated with peanut butter. The stomach of the holotype was empty so there is no direct evidence of diet. However, the morphological specializations shared with better-known congeners (stocky build, short tail, strong forelimbs with heavy claws, narrow hind feet with smooth plantar surfaces, sturdy cranium, and strong, prognathus upper incisors) suggest a semifossorial animal with vermivorous habits (Heaney et al. 1999; . The specimen was fresh when recovered from the trap in late afternoon (about 1600 h), demonstrating diurnal activity, as seen in the other species of Chrotomys ; specimen records from the FMNH collection). The holotype is an adult male that was in reproductive condition with testes measuring 20 \u00c2 12 mm, convoluted epididymides, and welldeveloped seminal vesicles.",

Among approximately 50 species of native murines known from the oceanic portion of the Philippines (i.e., excluding the Palawan region), only 5 (ca. 10%) occur on more than 1 oceanic Pleistocene island (Heaney et al. 1998; Rickart et al. 1998; Steppan et al. 2003) . These include C. mindorensis and Apomys musculus (on Luzon and Mindoro), Apomys ''sp. A/C'' (Negros-Panay and Sibuyan), Crunomys melanius (Mindanao and Camiguin), and Rattus everetti (Luzon, Mindoro, Mindanao, and some smaller oceanic islands). These islands are separated by water channels that, although deep (. 120 m), are in most instances relatively narrow (Fig. 1) . With the possible exception of A. musculus, the species involved also are notable in that they are among the few nonvolant small mammals of the Philippines that occur in lowland habitat (Heaney 2001; Heaney et al. 1998) . Apparently, occurrence at low elevations has facilitated dispersal across narrow water barriers that persisted during periods of lower sea level associated with Pleistocene glaciation. This pattern is particularly noteworthy given the apparent importance of overwater dispersal and subsequent speciation in the diversification of Philippine murines (Heaney 2000; Heaney and Rickart 1990; Steppan et al. 2003) .",

Although there are only rough geological dates for the origin of Sibuyan as a dryland island, the origin was sufficiently early to produce a level of endemism that is remarkable for an island of such small size. Of the 6 species of native nonvolant mammals known from Sibuyan, 3 are endemic to the island, including, in addition to C. sibuyanensis, an undescribed species of Apomys (''sp. B''- Steppan et al. 2003) , and an undescribed murine related to Tarsomys or Rattus (Heaney et al. 1998; G. Musser, pers. comm.) . Furthermore, as noted above, a 2nd undescribed species of Apomys (''sp. A/C'') is endemic to Sibuyan plus the neighboring oceanic island group of Negros-Panay (Steppan et al. 2003) . Finally, Sibuyan supports an endemic pteropodid bat in the genus Haplonycteris; it is 1 of only 10 species of pteropodids recorded from the island (Goodman and Ingle 1993; Heaney et al. 1998) . Camiguin, another small (265-km 2 ) island that is located just north of Mindanao but isolated by deep water, provides a parallel example; 2 of its 4 species of native rodents are island endemics (Heaney and Tabaranza, in press a, in press b; .",

Both C. silaceus and C. whiteheadi are endemic to the Central Cordillera of northern Luzon. The former is restricted to montane and mossy forest habitats mainly above 2,000 m elevation, whereas the latter has a broader elevational range and occurs in lower montane forests at midelevations down to 1,000 m (Heaney et al. 2005; Rabor 1955; Sanborn 1952) . Although these 2 species occur in local sympatry, differences in external and cranial morphology suggest some behavioral divergence. Furthermore, examination of our field data indicates microhabitat segregation of the 2 species along moisture gradients (specimen records and field notes of the FMNH collection). C. gonzalesi is restricted to upper montane and mossy forest habitats from 1,000 m to the peak elevation (1,966 m) on Mt. Isarog (Heaney et al. 1999; . Likewise, the holotype and sole example of C. sibuyanensis also is from high-elevation forest. In contrast, C. mindorensis occurs in lowland habitats below 1,000 m elevation (Barbehenn et al. 1973; Temme 1974) , and is one of relatively few native Philippine murines with an elevational distribution centered in the lowlands (Heaney et al. 1998) .",

Both occur in 2nd-growth habitat in or near agricultural areas (Barbehenn et al. 1973; Heaney et al. 2005; Temme 1974) . This is somewhat surprising given the extreme trophic specialization of these species. However, it may derive from the fact that earthworms, particularly nonnative species, may be especially abundant in disturbed areas (Tsai et al. 2000; S. James, pers. comm.) . In contrast, other species of Chrotomys are restricted to relatively intact forest habitats, and apparently are uncommon where they do occur (Balete and Heaney 1997; Goodman and Ingle 1993; Heaney et al. 2005; . In part, apparent rarity may simply reflect dietary specialization that makes these species difficult to trap with conventional baits and techniques (Balete and Heaney 1997; ). However, with the possible exception of C. mindorensis, members of this group have restricted geographic and ecological ranges and some populations may be threatened by loss of primary forest habitat.",
