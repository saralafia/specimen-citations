    "abstract": "Variation in neonatal maturity among mammals is often explained by variation in gestation length, but species may also differ in developmental rate, a quantity that is difficult to measure because the conventional formalism makes two important and potentially unrealistic assumptions: (1) ontogeny of form can be described by a single line, and (2) species have the same ontogeny of form. We examine two species, one precocial (Sigmodon fulviventer), the other altricial (Mus musculus domesticus), and find that neither assumption is met. Therefore, we introduce an alternative metric, the rate of shape differentiation away from the average neonate. We find that S. fulviventer has a lower developmental rate than M. m. domesticus; consequently, while more mature at birth, S. fulviventer loses ground to M. m. domesticus over time. Surprisingly, despite differences in gestation length and developmental rate, these species reach developmental and life-history milestones at nearly identical degrees of skull shape maturity.",

Developmental biology may contribute to these explanations because life-history schedules are one aspect of ontogeny and because developmental processes may integrate or decouple stages of a life cycle. Integration might be expected in groups that have continuous life cycles, such as mammals. But even dramatic changes in early mammalian post-natal development seem to have few (if any) consequences for later stages. Specifically, the transition from altricial development (characterized by blind, deaf, hairless and immobile neonates) to precocial development (characterized by sighted, hearing, furred and active neonates) does not seem to affect ages at which subsequent events occur (Neal, 1990; Derrickson, 1992) . Perhaps mammalian life cycles are so weakly integrated that selection can determine an optimal degree of maturity at one stage without affecting others. However, their integration is obscured by the complexity of factors affecting degree of maturity at birth.",

                "text": "Precocial development in mammals might not seem complex because it is usually ascribed to a lengthened gestation period (e.g. Millar, 1981; Martin & MacLarnon, 1985; Pagel & Harvey, 1988) . But precociality may be a more complex phenomenon, affected by developmental rate and timing as well as gestation length. Interspecific differences in rate and timing might explain why neither gestation period nor neonatal maturity adequately predicts the timing of later events. Developmental rates have long been of interest in studies relating morphogenesis to life history, a major theme in the literature on heterochrony (e.g. Gould, 1977) . Gould postulated that selection on developmental rate or timing might lead to predictable changes in adult morphology via indirect effects on morphogenesis. Analyses of heterochrony have typically relied on the Alberch et al. (1979) formalism ( Fig. 1) , which classifies evolutionary changes into changes in (1) age at onset of development (da), (2) developmental rate (dk r ), and (3) age at offset of development (db). Lengthening the intrauterine stage of development can be represented as +db, which yields mature neonates, represented as r p . But it is far easier to formulate hypotheses in these terms than to test them. The scheme is unquestionably useful as a heuristic device, but it is a problematic analytic tool. In particular, it makes two questionable assumptions about morphogenesis. The first is that the ontogeny of shape can be represented by a simple linear vector, the axis r. The second is that species do not differ in that trajectory, the premise underlying Gould's contention that heterochrony channels morphological evolution along the ancestral ontogenetic trajectory.",

The ontogeny of shape may be too complex and dynamic to be represented by a single straight line, as suggested by two studies of rodents, Sigmodon fulviventer (Zelditch et al., 1992) and Callomys expulsus (Hingst-Zaher et al., 2000) . However, other studies of mammals conclude that a linear approximation is reasonable (O'Higgins & Jones, 1998; O'Higgins et al., 2001; Penin & Berge, 2001; Singleton, 2002) , and one questions the conclusions drawn about S. fulviventer on methodological grounds (Monteiro et al., 1999) . Such doubts are legitimate because the hypothesis of linearity was not tested rigorously, nor has it been subject to serious testing in general, making its adequacy an open question -the first we address herein. The second assumption, that of the conservatism of morphogenesis, might seem well supported in the case of mammalian skull shape in the light of the numerous studies that find very similar ontogenies of form in comparisons among close relatives (e.g. Shea, 1983; dos Reis et al., 1988; Voss et al., 1992; Ravosa et al., 1995) . But they do not offer compelling statistical support for their conclusions, and those that examine more distant relatives often find significant differences among them (e.g. O'Higgins et al., 2001; Singleton, 2002) . Thus, this assumption is also open to question, and we examine this one as well.",

We extend this idea, adapting conventional methods for estimating growth rates and timings to the analysis of developmental rates, then use this approach to compare development and growth between two exemplar species, asking whether skull shape maturity predicts the timing of life-history and developmental milestones.

In the light of the distribution of precociality in myomorphs, it is reasonable to infer that precociality in Sigmodon is the derived condition. We choose M. m. domesticus to represent altricial myomorph rodents because of the large literature on that species, a model system for studies of mammalian development.

A geometric approach is appropriate in the light of the hypotheses we consider because both Gould's (1977) clock model and Alberch et al.'s schemes (1979) are explicitly based on a geometric conception of shape. Landmarks (Fig. 2) are sampled on the ventral view of the skull, which provides information about both trophic and cranial morphology. Skulls were skeletonized by dermestid beetles, photographed with the occlusal surface of the molars oriented parallel to the photographic plane, and digitized on both right and left sides. Bilaterally homologous landmarks were averaged to avoid inflating degrees of freedom (results are depicted for whole skulls to ease interpretation). Landmarks sampled on skulls of S. fulviventer and M. m. domesticus are shown in Fig. 2a and b, respectively; descriptions are given in Appendix 1. The selected landmarks differ between species because some could not be reliably located in both; in all interspecific comparisons, and when estimating rates of development, we use the subset of landmarks common to both species (all those depicted in Fig. 2b except ZA) . Landmark configurations are superimposed using the generalized least squares superimposition, which preserves all information about shape differences among specimens, removing only information unrelated to shape (i.e. scale, position and orientation; Rohlf & Slice, 1990) . As this procedure produces more variables than there are dimensions of shape, statistical analyses are performed on variables obtained by a rigid rotation of those data, i.e. partial warp scores, including the scores of the uniform component (Bookstein, 1989 (Bookstein, , 1991 .",

Ordinations are carried out using principal component analysis (PCA) to determine whether age-related variation lies along a single component, or instead, requires multiple dimensions, perhaps even exhibiting reversals along one or more axes. Statistical analyses are performed by comparing ontogenetic allometries of successive phases statistically. Using piecewise multivariate linear regression we obtain a vector describing the ontogeny of shape over a given phase of development (i.e. from 1 to 10 days of age, from 10 to 20 days of age). The components of the vector are regression coefficients for the shape variables (partial warps plus the scores on the uniform component) on size (measured by centroid size, the square root of the summed squared distance between each landmark and the centroid of the form). To compare vectors from successive phases we estimate the angle between them (the cosine of this angle is the vector correlation, R v ). When successive phases do not differ, the angle between the vectors is 0.0\u00b0, and R v is 1.0\u00b0. To statistically test the null hypothesis that trajectories of shape are the same from phase to phase we need to estimate the uncertainty around each trajectory, which is carried out by resampling (Efron & Tibshirani, 1993) . The null hypothesis is that the observed angle could have been produced by two independent samplings of a single ontogenetic phase. This is tested by estimating the distribution of angles that could be obtained from repeated sampling of the ontogeny of a single population. Briefly, the expected shape at each size is estimated from the multivariate regression equation, and residuals are calculated for each individual; each specimen thus gives a multidimensional set of residuals representing its deviation from the expected shape for its size. The complete set of residuals for each individual is bootstrapped as an entire set, thereby preserving the covariance structure among variables. The set of residuals (drawn at random with replacement) is added to the expected value of shape for each given size to produce a bootstrap replica of the original data set. Two ontogenetic vectors are derived from a pair of these bootstrap sets and the angle between them is calculated. Should the observed angle between phases exceed the 95% confidence interval of the two within-phase ranges, the difference is judged statistically significant. As sample sizes differ for different ages, the analysis is carried out in terms of the distribution of bootstrapped data sets at comparable sample sizes.",

This test is needed for two reasons; pieces of the ontogenetic vector that differ significantly might be more similar than expected by chance, and also, because of small sample sizes, those pieces might be no more similar than expected by chance even if they do not differ significantly. To test this second null hypothesis, we randomly reshuffle the observed allometric coefficients 400 times, asking whether the angle between two observed vectors exceeds that found by comparing either to a vector of randomized coefficients. Reshuffling observed coefficients preserves the range of values found in the data, and also the proportion of isometric, positively allometric, and negatively allometric coefficients. Should the observed correlation exceed the 95% upper bound of correlations among randomized coefficients, we reject the null hypothesis of no greater similarity than expected by chance.",

The next two components each describe age-related deviations from the linear trend; neither, by itself, accounts for a large fraction of the variation but taken together they account for over 10% of the variance in S. fulviventer and over 20% in M. m. domesticus. As would be expected, these components exhibit a nonlinear relationship with age (and size).

Scores on PC3 are positively correlated with age from 10 to 30 days, then negatively correlated (P < 0.05). Thus, the ontogeny of shape in this species is described by a vector that curves in a minimally three-dimensional space.

Interestingly, just prior to stabilization, the successive stages are no more similar than expected by chance (indicated by the large angle of 73.5\u00b0). The differences are visually striking (Fig. 4 ). There is a consistent trend throughout ontogeny: skull elongation, to a greater extent, anteriorly than posteriorly. Rates of relative growth do not follow a strict anteroposterior gradient, especially not in the earliest stage ( Fig. 4a) . At the youngest stage, the most striking departure from a skull-wide gradient occurs in the palatal region (posterior to the incisive foramen). From the incisive foramen to the posterior palatine foramen, relative growth rates decrease, then increase at the presphenoid-basisphenoid suture, remaining high to the basisphenoid-basioccipital suture. At older stages, the deviations from the general gradient are slighter and smoother, especially between 20 and 30 days (Fig. 4c) , when again there are relatively low growth rates from posterior to the incisive foramen to the posterior palatine foramen. At this age, however, the accelerations and decelerations are less abrupt than earlier. Additionally, there are some marked local changes in the posterolateral braincase, including an abrupt and exceptionally localized deceleration just medial to the mastoid process, which might be related to the change in skull orientation.",

Subsequently, the trajectory of shape changes direction again; the allometric pattern of the 20-25-day stage is no more similar to that of the 25-30-day stage than expected by chance. The comparison between the next two stages is difficult to interpret because of the enormous range of within-age angles, probably attributable to small sample sizes. In the light of the large angle between 25-30 and 30-40-day-old samples, it is difficult to argue that the trajectories point in the same direction.

Weaning is defined herein as the age at which litters can be safely removed from the mother, and sexual maturity as the age at first conception. As evident from Fig. 7a , these two species differ considerably in degree of shape maturity at eye-opening, when S. fulviventer has attained only 36% of adult shape maturity but M. m. domesticus has reached 50% of its adult maturity. After that point, the two species are nearly identical in degree of maturity at the developmental and life-history milestones. At the end of localized palatal morphogenesis, S. fulviventer has attained 57% of its adult maturity of shape, in comparison with the 56% reached by M. m. domesticus. At weaning, the species are again nearly identical in degree of maturity (72 and 69% in S. fulviventer and M. m. domesticus, respectively). Even age at sexual maturity, which has no obvious causal connection to skull morphology, is remarkably well predicted by skull shape maturity; at that point, S. fulviventer has attained 91% of adult shape maturity, similar to the 95% reached by M. m. domesticus. From weaning onwards, they are also nearly identical in their proportion of adult size attained at each milestone ( Fig. 7b) .

In demonstrating that spatiotemporal patterns of growth are dynamic, our results are consistent with the conclusions of a previous study of S. fulviventer (Zelditch et al., 1992) , but the fully multivariate and more statistically rigorous approach taken herein provides stronger evidence for them. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the nonlinearity of skull morphogenesis is not peculiar to S. fulviventerit is also characteristic of M. m. domesticus, a model system for mammalian development. However, we cannot conclude that all mammals, or even all rodents, have equally complex ontogenies.

But even if unsurprising, these findings, plus the evidence of curvilinear trajectories, reveal a serious problem for comparative studies that rely on linear methods and models, such as the Alberch et al. (1979) formalism. Treating ontogenetic trajectories as ontogenetically and historically constant undoubtedly simplifies comparisons, but that simplicity has a high cost -loss of information about the ontogenetic and evolutionary dynamics of morphogenesis. Some workers have questioned whether those ontogenetic and evolutionary dynamics pose serious problems for studies of heterochrony (Penin & Berge, 2001 ). Our results indicate that the deviations from a simple linear model are substantial, both in ontogeny and phylogeny.",

(1979) parameters, namely, that a is the age at onset of development, b is the age at offset of development, and that k r is the rate at which shape matures (see Fig. 1 ). Our approach accommodates both the curvilinearity of ontogenies in shape space and the nonlinearity of rates relative to time. The nonlinearity of mammalian growth rates relative to time has long been known, and as we show, rates of shape differentiation are also nonlinear, fitting classic growth models well. But it is important to note that the metric we use has two important shortcomings. First, a large distance between shapes need not indicate a large difference in degree of maturity. It could mean than an individual is oddly shaped. To estimate rates of maturity, it is important that samples be large enough to allow for estimating the mean shape for each age reliably. Second, if comparisons begin at different developmental stages, then the starting points are not biologically equivalent, which could have a large impact on the shape of the developmental curve and its parameters. But even if not ideal, our metric can accommodate realistic depictions of ontogeny and it predicts life-history schedules remarkably well.",

Despite their differences in degree of maturity at birth, S. fulviventer and M. m. domesticus reach post-natal milestones at virtually the same degree of skull maturity. Sigmodon fulviventer is born more mature because its gestation length is longer, meaning its neonates are older. But it still takes longer to reach subsequent milestones (such as weaning), because its developmental rate is lower. The interaction between age and developmental rate apparently explains the timing of post-natal life histories, indicating that a single set of developmental rate and timing parameters governs the entire post-natal period.",

But there may be costs to developing rapidly. However, it is not clear that differences between species in degree of maturity at birth are significant; in the light of the high rates of development near birth, small errors in the estimates of age at that point (due to relying on day rather than on hour of birth) could have a disproportionately large impact.",

This is concordant with a study of body weight ontogeny in a related species, S. hispidus, which also finds that neonates are unusually small relative to their adult size (McClure & Randolph, 1980) . Based on the parameters of skull growth we estimate herein, we can see one reason for delaying growth: given the estimated growth rate, were S. fulviventer to start growing at the same age as M. m. domesticus, infants would be born with enormous skulls (65% of adult size). This would not be problematic were litter sizes small, but the most carefully studied species in this genus, S. hispidus, averages 5.6 infants per litter in the laboratory (McClure & Randolph, 1980) and Sigmodon females have 10 mammae, suggesting that litters can be very large. Delaying the onset of growth reduces neonatal size without lowering growth rates. This interpretation depends on taking estimates of T 0 seriously, a practice that must be treated with caution because the estimates are based on extrapolations beyond the range of observed ages. Our estimate of T 0 for M. m. domesticus coincides with closure of the anterior neuropore and the onset of visible brain enlargement (Theiler, 1972) , suggesting that the extrapolation in this case is reasonable. Nevertheless, before assuming that these estimates of T 0 are biologically reasonable in all cases, we need more extensive studies of species for which normal tables are available.",
