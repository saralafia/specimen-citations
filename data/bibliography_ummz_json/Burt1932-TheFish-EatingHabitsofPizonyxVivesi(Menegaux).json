The bats were found in company with a species of petrel (H alocyptena microsoma Coues) and were suspected by Diguet, but without evidence, of subsisting on the excrement of these birds. Miller and Allen (U. S. Nat. Mus. Bull. 144, p. 213, 1928) , in speaking of this species, say, \"While we are thus left in complete ignorance as to the animal's food habits it seems not improbable that the enlarged foot and claws, the relative freedom of the leg from the wing membrane, and the elongation of the cusps of the teeth may be associated with a diet consisting at least partly of fish. The resemblance of the leg, foot, and calcar to those of N octilio, a bat which is well known to devour small fish, is obvious.\"",

That evening I remained on the island hoping that I might see the bats emerge from their retreats; I watched until darkness had completely fallen, but saw no bats. I returned to the boat for the night, but landed on the island the following morning before daybreak. At this time the bats were all back in their retreats and could be heard squeaking over the entire hillside. This chorus continued until daylight when it gradually died down. The bats had come out too late in the evening and had returned too early in the morning for any observations on them to be made; however, two more were collected and killed immediately so that any food remaining in the stomachs might be preserved. Upon dissection the stomachs were found to be distended with finely chewed fish remains, confirming the supposition of Miller and Allen that these bats probably subsisted at least in part on fish. Dr. Evermann of the California Academy of Sciences has been kind enough to examine one of the stomachs and has identified the fish as belonging to the sardine tribe. Although we now have definite evidence that these bats, like Noctilio, eat fish, the manner in which they catch them is still somewhat of a mystery; however, there is little doubt that the specialized claws aid the animals in procuring their food.",

Dickey visited Isla Partida on June 1, 1928, at which time he collected 67 specimens, many of which were young. In his field notes for that day, he describes the habitat of this bat as follows: \"The first occupied crevice I opened up contained one least petrel and two bats (Pizonyx vivesi). All morning we kept finding the bats and both black and least petrels in the same crevices. In fact the best description of the bat retreats is to say that we found them only in typical rock-slide colonies of petrels. These mixed colonies differed somewhat-perhaps according to the size of the rocks and crevices-in the ratio of their three component species, but on the basis of the whole morning's work I would say the ratio was somewhere near: bats, 10; least petrels, 10; black petrels, 1. I scouted around, overturning rocks here and there on the open hillsides, but found no bat except in close contact with petrels.\" During our visit to the island on January 9 and 10, 1932, the petrels were absent from their nesting grounds. Although most of the bats occupied crevices that had been used as nesting sites by petrels during the previous year a few were found beneath stones where petrels had not frequented. The steep hillside on which we found the colony of bats was strewn with lava rocks, many of which were piled upon one another. Cardon cactus (Pachycereus pringlei) was also 'distributed rather densely, for that type of cactus, over the hillside. The rocks were porous and easily overturned because of their light weight.",
