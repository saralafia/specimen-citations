Although certain aspects of didelphid classification have remained stable for many years, notably the generic taxonomy of the larger opossums, recent discoveries have underscored our still very incomplete knowledge of phylogenetic diversity and relationships among the smaller forms, especially the so-called ''marmosines'' (formerly classified as, or allied with, Marmosa Gray, 1821). Such discoveries include highly divergent new clades (Voss et al., 2001; Voss and Jansa, 2003; Voss et al., 2004) and unsuspected species-level diversity concealed by traditional synonymies (Mustrangi and Patton, 1997; Voss et al., 2001; Patton and Costa, 2003) . Both phenomena suggest that the current classification of small didelphids requires critical attention.",

Although Tate (1933) treated Marmosops as a junior synonym of Marmosa, he acknowledged that Matschie's taxon corresponded to a diagnosable cluster of species (the ''Noctivaga Group'') that could logically be recognized as a subgenus. In the decades that followed, however, Marmosops contin-ued to be treated as a junior synonym of Marmosa, even in classifications that used subgeneric categories (e.g., Cabrera, 1958; Reig et al., 1985) . The current recognition of Marmosops as a distinct taxon dates from Gardner and Creighton (1989) , who raised all of Tate's species groups of Marmosa to generic rank.",

                "text": "As currently recognized in the systematic literature, Marmosops includes 36 nominal taxa, of which 14 are considered to be valid species and 22 to be subspecies or junior synonyms (table 1) . The geographic dispersion of type localities ( fig. 1 ) approximates the distribution of the genus itself, which ranges from Panama to southeastern Brazil. Species of Marmosops occur in lowland rain forests, lowland dry forests, and in montane (''cloud'') forests to about 3000 m above sea level. Trapping studies suggest that these small (20-120 g) opossums are predominantly understory species that are often taken on the ground or a few meters above the ground (e.g., on logs, branches, and lianas), but apparently never in the canopy (Malcolm, 1991; Patton et al., 2000; Voss et al., 2001; Cunha and Vieira, 2002; Vieira and Monteiro-Filho, 2003) . Although alleged to be insectivorous or omnivorous (Emmons, 1997; Mustrangi and Patton, 1997; Cordero, 2001; Voss et al., 2001) , no analyses of relevant dietary data have been published. In fact, the natural history of Marmosops remains almost completely unstudied despite the local abundance of some species in relatively accessible habitats. Museum specimens of Marmosops are frequently misidentified due to the absence of any comprehensive current reference for identifications. Although progress has been made in sorting out the taxonomy of Marmosops in southeastern Brazil (Mustrangi and Patton, 1997) , western Amazonia (Patton et al., 2000) , and the Guiana region (Voss et al., 2001) , no revisionary literature has addressed the species-level systematics of the genus in other parts of its enormous geographic range, especially along the Andes. Even a superficial familiarity with the large collections that have accumulated since Tate's (1933) revision suggests the urgent need for testing traditionally accepted species concepts with newly available material.",

                "text": "DIAGNOSIS: Species of Marmosops can be distinguished from other small didelphid marsupials by the following combination of character states: eye surrounded by mask of blackish fur contrasting in color with paler fur of crown and cheeks; dorsal pelage uni- formly colored, unpatterned; manus mesaxonic (digit III longer than adjacent digits II and IV); manual claws small, not exceeding fleshy apical pads in length; central palmar surface of manus smooth (not densely tuberculate); digit IV of pes longer than adjacent digit III; caudal scales in spiral series; middle hair of each caudal-scale triplet petiolate (narrower basally than at midlength), thicker, and usually more heavily pigmented than lateral hairs; tail longer than the combined length of head and body, not incrassate; ventral surface of tail-tip modified for prehension; premaxillary rostral process usually well developed; postorbital processes usually absent; petrosal usually exposed on lateral surface of braincase through fenestra between squamosal and parietal bones; maxillary fenestrae absent; posterolateral palatal foramina small, not extending lingual to M4 protocones; maxillary and alisphenoid not in contact on floor of orbit; extracranial course of mandibular nerve (V 3 ) enclosed by anteromedial strut of alisphenoid bulla (secondary foramen ovale present); fenestra cochleae exposed laterally (not enclosed in a bony sinus); I2-I5 with approximately symmetrical rhomboidal crowns increasing in breadth from front to back; P2 and P3 subequal in height; molar dentition highly carnassialized; centrocrista strongly V-shaped, its apex high above trigon basin; lower canine (c1) procumbent and premolariform (always with a flattened, bladelike apex and usually with a small posterior accessory cusp); p2 taller than p3; dp3 fully molariform; m3 hypoconid labially salient; entoconid large and well developed on m1-m3. COMPARISONS WITH MARMOSA: Species of Marmosops have long been confused with Marmosa, which they superficially resemble in size and external appearance, but these taxa are only distantly related (Jansa and Voss, 2000; Voss and Jansa, 2003) and can readily be distinguished by qualitative integumental and craniodental characters (table 2). In the field, two external characters are useful for generic identification. Whereas the manus of Marmosops is mesaxonic, with digit (d) III distinctly longer than the adjacent digits (dII and dIV; fig. 3A ), the manus of Marmosa is paraxonic, with dIII and dIV subequal in length ( fig. 3B ). Easily determined from live specimens (or properly fluid-preserved material) with elastic phalangeal joints that can be manipulated to align and straighten adjacent digits for relative length comparisons, this character is often hard to score from dried skins with hard, bent, twisted, or otherwise distorted fingers (see Voss and Jansa, 2003: character 10) . A second distinguishing external trait is the morphology of the caudal pelage, of which the central hair in each caudal-scale triplet is petiolate (narrower basally than at mid-length), thicker, and usually more darkly pigmented than the lateral hairs in Marmosops; by contrast, the three hairs of each caudal-scale triplet are subequal in thickness and similarly shaped and pigmented in Marmosa (Voss and Jansa, 2003: character 27) .",

In all examined juvenile specimens of Marmosops (fig. 7, upper panel) this tooth is fully molariform because the trigonid includes a distinct paraconid, protoconid, and metaconid. By contrast, the dp3 of juvenile Marmosa ( fig. 7 , lower panel) is not fully molariform because the bicuspid trigonid lacks a distinct metaconid. COMPARISONS WITH GRACILINANUS: Museum specimens of Marmosops are sometimes misidentified as Gracilinanus, apparently the result of using inaccurate published keys. 5 Despite such confusion, the two genera can be distinguished unambiguously by several external morphological differences (table 2) . Unlike Marmosops, which has a mesaxonic manus with dIII longer than the other digits, Gracilinanus (like Marmosa) has a paraxonic manus with dIII and dIV subequal in length. Also, whereas Marmosops has spirally arranged caudal scales, the caudal scales of Gracilinanus are arranged in predominantly NO. 3466 AMERICAN MUSEUM NOVITATES annular series (Voss and Jansa, 2003: character 23) . Lastly, the central hair of each caudal-scale triplet is petiolate, thicker, and usually more heavily pigmented than the lateral hairs in Marmosops, whereas the central hair is not conspicuously differentiated from the lateral hairs in Gracilinanus (Voss and Jansa, 2003: character 27) .",

The most taxonomically complete analysis to date (Voss and Jansa, 2003) included only five species of Marmosops, but among these were members of the diminutive M. parvidens complex as well as large Amazonian and southeastern Brazilian forms; generic monophyly was supported in separate parsimony analyses of both nonmolecular (morphological \u03e9 karyotypic) characters and sequences from exon 1 of the nuclear gene encoding the Interphotoreceptor Retinoid Binding Protein (IRBP), in a likelihood analysis of the IRBP data, and in a parsimony analysis of a combined-data (nonmolecular \u03e9 IRBP) supermatrix. The only discrepant result concerning generic monophyly, Kirsch and Palma's (1995) report that Gracilinanus agilis and Marmosops dorothea are almost indistinguishable by thermal elution of scnDNA heteroduplexes, is now known to be an artifact of specimen misidentification (see Voss and Jansa, 2003: 57) .",

The recently described genus Chacodelphys may also belong to this group (Voss et al., 2004) . Although Patton et al. (1996) recovered Marmosops as the sister taxon of Caluromys, the cytochrome-b sequences they analyzed appear to be substitution-saturated at this level of taxonomic comparison (Jansa and Voss, 2000: fig. 12 ), and the relationship in question (Marmosops \u03e9 Caluromys) had only trivial bootstrap support in their parsimony results. Palma and Spotorno's (1999) report of a sister-group relationship between Marmosops and Metachirus (supported by very large bootstrap values in their neighbor-joining and parsimony trees) is an unexplained anomaly that is not consistent with any other analytic results or character data of which we are aware.

In Marmosa, the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve (V 3 , reconstructed course shown by heavy arrow) emerges from the endocranial lumen via the foramen ovale (fo), which is bordered by the alisphenoid (als) and the petrosal (pet); the extracranial course of the nerve is unenclosed in this taxon. In Marmosops, however, the extracranial course of V 3 is partially enclosed by a bony strut (st) that extends from the anteromedial surface of the tympanic wing of the alisphenoid (twa) across the transverse canal foramen (tcf); the nerve then emerges from a so-called secondary foramen ovale. Other abbreviations: bs, basisphenoid; bo, basioccipital; cc, carotid canal; ect, ectotympanic. ricular pelage is only microscopically visible). Laid back alongside the head, the short mystacial vibrissae do not extend to the tips of the pinnae. A small patch of almost-naked skin on the midline of the throat suggests the presence of a weakly developed gular gland in all of the male specimens examined. The metacarpals and metatarsals are covered with dark (brownish) hairs, but the digits of both manus and pes are abruptly whitish. All of the males we examined have a knob-like glabrous tubercle on the lateral aspect of the wrist that is absent in both females. The scrotal epithelium is pigmented (mottled-grayish in preservative) and sparsely covered by brownish fur. Both female specimens have 4-1-4 \u03ed 9 abdominal-inguinal mammae. Body fur extends onto a short (ca. 1 cm) segment of the tail base, but the remainder (\u03fe90%) of the tail is virtually naked and covered by epidermal scales in predominantly spiral series. Under high magnification (25-50\u03eb) , each caudal scale is seen to have three hairs projecting from its posterior margin; the central hair is visibly thicker than the lateral hairs, but perhaps not quite twice as wide. On the dorsal surface of the tail, these hairs are no more than one to two scale rows long, but they are longer (three to four scale rows) on the ventral caudal surface. The exposed caudal epithelium is dark (grayish) above and below basally, but it is indistinctly bicolored (dark above, pale below) for at least half the length of that organ, and the tail-tip is entirely white for the last 1-3 cm.",

We have trapped in three habitats here: cloud forest (relatively undisturbed), 2nd growth forest-with much bamboo; and artificial clearings under power lines . . .

Lichens & moss on trees are solid in places but not as ''lush'' as near Cuticucho. There are more broadleaf trees and ''papaya-like'' trees here. Also large (\u03f310 m) tree ferns. Bamboo undergrowth is extensive and very dense near artificial clearings. Little undergrowth beneath the bamboo except for a few ferns. [6 October 1979] The first four nights of trapping (5) (6) (7) (8) at this site yielded only rodents (the same species as those found in the cloud forest near Cuticucho plus Microryzomys minutus and Thomasomys cf. oreas), but two specimens of Marmosops creightoni were taken on 9 October and another on 10 October. Creighton's notes for these dates indicate that the marsupials were trapped in ''humid, dark, mossy forest'' on horizontal branches near large trees ''covered with moss, ferns, bromeliads & vines''. Apparently, they were ''not caught coming to the bait but, rather, blundering into the traps as they tiptoe along their accustomed routes.'' The area where all three Marmosops were trapped included ''about the only places where high, undisturbed natural forest is accessible enough to set a trapline'', the only other primary forest being restricted to very steep slopes above the cultivated valley floor.

Although one adult male (MSB 55843) has an almost-naked patch of skin and a streak of red-stained fur on the midline of the throat, two others (CBF 7531, LHE 1541) have no trace of a gular gland. All three adult males have well-developed, blade-like lateral carpal tubercles, and the scrotum is pale, with white fur and unpigmented skin.

This specimen has redder dorsal fur and narrower nasals than do most Peruvian specimens, but its morphology is otherwise a good match with topotypical (Peruvian) material. Other Bolivian specimens previously referred to this species, however, appear to represent different taxa. Anderson (1997: 153) reported two specimens identified as Marmosops impavidus from Incachaca in Cochabamba department, but cited only one by catalog number (AMNH 38718); the specimen in question is a juvenile whose broken skull (originally miscataloged as 38711) exhibits incipient supraorbital beading, very short canines, and small molars (LM \u03ed 6.3 mm), traits that closely match Tate's (1933) description of yungasensis-a taxon that we consider to be a junior synonym of M. noctivagus (see below). Two other Bolivian specimens explicitly identified by Anderson as M. impavidus are UMMZ 126680 (from 20 km NNE Caranavi, in La Paz department) and UMMZ 156014 (from 1 km E La Embocada, in Beni department). The former is a subadult whose lack of supraorbital beading is possibly due to immaturity, but whose lack of a postorbital constriction more closely resembles the material we refer to M. noctivagus (see below). UMMZ 156014, however, is an example of M. bishopi (see above). The only additional material that Anderson referred to M. impavidus consists of MSB 57000 (from Independencia in Pando department) and MSB 58508 (from 2 km S Caranda in Santa Cruz department); both are examples of ''Gracilinanus'' unduaviensis, a taxon that is currently treated (e.g., by Gardner, 1993) as a junior synonym of G. agilis.

The name noctivagus is based on Peruvian type material that we have not examined, but a series of AMNH specimens from the Andean piedmont (\u03fd1000 m) near Tarma in the department of Jun\u00edn are moreor-less topotypical, and we have a large series of very similar specimens from Loreto. One Bolivian specimen from La Paz (USNM 579250) and three from Pando (AMNH 262402-262404) closely resemble this lowland Peruvian material and could be referred to the nominotypical subspecies (M. n. noctivagus) if a trinomial nomenclature were needed. This material comprises relatively NO. 3466 AMERICAN MUSEUM NOVITATES Measurements (mm) and Weights (g) of Lowland Specimens of Marmosops noctivagus from Peru and Bolivia large specimens (table 9) with dull reddishbrown dorsal fur, mostly self-whitish ventral fur, pale-furred metapodials that do not contrast abruptly in color with the digits, and more-or-less unicolored (all-dark) tails. All of the adult males we examined have welldeveloped gular glands, knobby (not bladelike) lateral carpal tubercles, and pale scrotums with whitish fur and unpigmented skin. Although we have not seen fluid-preserved parous adult females from Bolivia, two Peruvian specimens (AMNH 272782, 273051) each have 5-1-5 \u03ed 11 mammae, of which the anteriormost pair is pectoral. Associated skulls have distinct supraorbital beads (best developed in fully adult individuals; fig. 4B ) and lack dorsally visible postorbital constrictions; palatine fenestrae are present, and the auditory bullae are small and conical. The upper canine lacks accessory cusps, and M4 is very wide. The remaining Bolivian material that we refer to Marmosops noctivagus is from the foothills and lower montane regions of Beni, Cochabamba, and La Paz. The specimens in question include the type material of dorothea and yungasensis, but an older name for the same phenotype is keaysi (from southern Peru; appendix 1). 11 Measurements of representative examples (including relevant type material; table 10) indicate that these highland specimens are about the same size as typical (lowland) noctivagus, but they have (on average) slightly broader interorbital regions, shorter molar rows, and narrower fourth upper molars. In addition, the dorsal fur tends to be slightly longer, the palatal fenestrae to be somewhat larger, and the bullae to be more inflated in highland examples than in lowland specimens. Also, whereas 11 Although Anderson (1997: 152-154) reported ''Marmosops dorothea'' and ''Marmosops noctivagus keaysi'' as co-occuring at Chijchijpa in the department of La Paz, all of the specimens in question (at AMNH and MSB) are taxonomically indistinguishable. Anderson's records of these taxa from Chijchijpa therefore represent alternative identifications (apparently copied from skin labels), not sympatry. most lowland specimens have more-or-less unicolored (all dark) tails, tails of highland specimens are usually indistinctly bicolored (dark above, pale below) and particolored (paler distally than basally). Despite such elevation-correlated phenotypic variation, cytochrome-b sequences analyzed by Mustrangi and Patton (1997) and by Patton et al. (2000) indicate only minor divergence (about 3%) among lowland and highland haplotypes of noctivagus-like Marmosops, including specimens from the Amazonian lowlands of western Brazil (e.g., INPA 2931), the Andean slopes of southeastern Peru (e.g., MVZ 171408), and northern Bolivia (e.g., AMNH 268936). The nominal taxon that Tate (1931) described as albiventris, currently synonymized with M. impavidus, is morphologically indistinguishable from M. noctivagus and has similar mtDNA sequences (Mustrangi and Patton, 1997) . 12 Traditional taxonomic distinctions among forms that we consider conspecific with Marmosops noctivagus are almost entirely based on coat color. Tate (1933: 153-161) , for example, described the dorsal fur as ''varying from natal brown . . . to Mars brown'' in typical noctivagus, by contrast with ''bone brown . . . or warm sepia'' in keaysi and ''pecan brown'' in dorothea. These chromatic differences are real, but similarities among these nominal taxa in other morphological characters, the existence of intermediate pelage hues in larger series of noctivagus-like eastern-slope specimens obtained in recent years, and the modest range of mtDNA variation among geographically widespread samples suggest that such color contrasts are not taxonomically significant.",

For example, the ho-lotype of keaysi is an exceptionally large male with a very broad interorbit that is not matched by any paratype or topotype that we examined. By contrast, the holotype of dorothea has an unusually narrow interorbit, and the holotype of yungasensis has a conspicuously short molar toothrow. Unfortunately, there are no large series from any locality to serve as a relevant standard by which such morphometric variation might be assessed. Just among the 11 specimens of ''yungasensis'' from Pitiguaya, however, interorbital breadth varies from 5.6 to 6.4 mm, and length of the molar series varies from 6.3 to 7.1 mm. Therefore, none of the exceptional values for these dimensions in table 10 would appear inconsistent with the hypothesis that the taxa represent one geographically variable species.",

The metapodials are covered dorsally with pale (whitish) hairs that do not contrast abruptly in color with the digits. The tail is distinctly bicolored (dark above, pale below) and particolored (paler distally than proximally), such that the distal one-third or more of the organ is completely pale in most specimens. Most examined males have no trace of a gular gland, the only exception being the holotype (an unusually large specimen; table 11), in which the gland appears to be present. The lateral carpal tubercles of adult males are bulbous or knoblike, and the scrotum is pale (with whitish fur and unpigmented skin). Three parous adult female specimens prepared in the field by L.H. Emmons (LHE 1468 , 1596 , 1808 each had 6-1-6 \u03ed 13 mammae, of which the anteriormost two pairs appear to be pectoral in digital images that we examined. The supraorbital margins of the skull are rounded, lacking distinct beads even in the largest specimens, and a shallow postorbital constriction is dorsally visible. Palatine fenestrae are consistently present, the upper canine lacks accessory cusps, and the auditory bullae are moderately large.",

Although the difference between exemplar sequences of these Measurements (mm) and Weights (g) of Selected Specimens of Marmosops ocellatus a taxa (about 5.7%; table 6) is not as large as the differences observed among other species recognized by us, the phenotypic distinctiveness of M. ocellatus and its apparently discrete geographic distribution suggest that it represents a unique evolutionary lineage that should be known by its own name.",
