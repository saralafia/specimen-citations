An analysis of replacement and silent substitutions, using a counting method designed for samples with small evolutionary distances, showed a significant difference between the two genes. The different patterns of replacement and silent substitutions within Jarid1d and Jarid1c may be a result of evolutionary mechanisms that are particularly strong on the Y chromosome because of its unique properties.

Interestingly, the properties of Y chromosomes are similar in some of the independently evolved instances that have been studied (e.g., Fridolfsson et al. 1998; Steinemann and Steinemann 1998; Tucker et al. 2003 ; Ceplitis and Ellegren 2004; Zhang 2004) . One model of sex chromosome evolution, derived mainly from studies in Drosophila, is that chromosomal sex determination may evolve from genic sex determination by the gradual accumulation of sex-specific genes in the region of the sex-determining gene, where they would be more likely to be inherited by offspring of the correct sex. Suppression of recombination may keep these genes that are beneficial to males from being inherited by females but also allow divergence and erosion of the sex-specific genes (reviewed by Rice 1996) .",

Sex chromosomes have characteristics that may cause their genes to evolve with different rates and patterns from genes on other chromosomes. Two of these characteristics are that most of the Y is completely genetically linked and it has a small effective population size, each of which may interfere with natural selection through several mechanisms (recently reviewed by Rice 1996; Charlesworth and Charlesworth 2000; Lahn et al. 2001; Tucker et al. 2003) . We are interested in determining if genes on the Y chromosome show patterns of evolution consistent with an interference with natural selection, which causes purifying selection to be inefficient, or if these genes evolve in a locus-specific manner related to their particular functions.",

The gene under study may be compared to a similar gene that is thought to undergo purifying selection. Some Y chromosomal genes have ''gametologs'' which are related genes found on the X chromosome, with similarity retained from before recombination between the X and Y chromosomes ceased (Garcia-Moreno and Mindell 2000). If purifying selection is interfered with by the properties of the Y, the dN/dS of a Y chromosomal gene is expected to be higher than the dN/dS of its X chromosomal gametolog.",

Indeed, the dN/ dS of the Y chromosomal genes was higher than the dN/dS of their X chromosomal gametologs. It was concluded that either the Y chromosome genes are continuing to evolve new functions or that a Y chromosomal effect is causing more nonsynonymous substitutions. These results are intriguing, but it is also valuable to examine this question in a finerscale phylogenetic context in which less time has elapsed and fewer multiple hits have occurred. We chose to examine gametologous gene pairs within the mouse genus Mus. One advantage of using this particular system is that two Y chromosomal genes (Sry and Zfy) have already been examined in these species. However, each of these genes may have evolved as it did because of factors unrelated to their positions on the Y chromosome (Tucker and Lundrigan 1993; Jansa et al. 2003; Tucker et al. 2003) , compelling further study.",

We sequenced and analyzed Jarid1d from the Y chromosome [formerly Smcy, Selected mouse cDNA on Y (Agulnik et al. 1994a) ] and Jarid1c from the X chromosome [formerly Smcx (Agulnik et al. 1994b) ] in species of the mouse genus Mus (family Muridae, subfamily Murinae). These genes are members of the highly conserved Jarid subfamily (reviewed by Patsialou et al. 2005) and were renamed to reflect that relationship in January 2004 (http://www.informatics.jax.org). Jarid1c partially escapes X inactivation in mice (Wu et al. 1994b; Sheardown et al. 1996) and in humans (Wu et al. 1994a) . Jarid1c also appears to escape X inactivation in other primates, horses, dogs, whales, and elephants (Jegalian and Page 1998), al-though more Jarid1c mRNA is expressed in female mouse brains than Jarid1c and Jarid1d combined in male mouse brains (Xu et al. 2002) . In gametolog pairs in which the X-linked gene escapes inactivation, males may be constrained to have exactly one functionally equivalent gene on the Y chromosome to maintain an equivalent gene dosage (reviewed by Lahn and Page 1997; Disteche 1999). Jarid1d and Jarid1c were chosen for this study because the genes are similar in expression patterns (Agulnik et al. 1994a ) and seem likely to share functions (Agulnik et al. 1999 ; but see Jensen et al. 2005). Thus, differences between them are more likely to be due to their chromosomal positions than differences between other gene pairs that have very different expression patterns or functions. We report a Y chromosomal effect on the evolution of Jarid1d when compared to Jarid1c in the mammalian genus Mus.",

To obtain a well-supported and completely resolved topology for use in ancestral reconstruction, maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood outgroup-rooted trees were built using sequences from six nuclear genes including Jarid1d and Jarid1c (Tucker et al. 2005 ). These trees are identical to each other, but this topology differs from the Jarid1d-and Jarid1cspecific tree from the first analysis in two ways. The branches that were previously unresolved are now resolved, and the relationship of Hylomyscus and Mastomys is changed (Fig. 2 ). This tree topology was converted to an unrooted topology for the analysis. Numbers of replacement and silent substitutions within the genus Mus were counted on each reconstructed tree. Using the ACCTRAN reconstructions, Jarid1c has 5 replacement and 14 silent changes. Jarid1d has 22 replacement and 17 silent changes ( Table 1 ). The exact numbers of substitutions differ with the different methods of reconstructing ancestral sequences but in each case the results are similar: There are more replacement substitutions relative to silent substitutions in Jar-id1d than in Jarid1c. For each reconstruction method, Fisher\u00d5s exact test shows a significant difference in the numbers of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions between Jarid1d and Jarid1c (p < 0.05) (Table 1) . When replacement and silent substitutions of the most distantly related taxa, Hylomyscus and Mastomys, are included with those of Mus, the difference is significant only when the DELTRAN reconstructions are used. This disparity in results can be traced to the long branch between the Hylomyscus/Mastomys clade and the Mus clade, where uncorrected distances may not be appropriate measures. (Agulnik et al. 1994a, b) . Neither Jarid1c nor Jarid1d has diverged rapidly. Along some branches of the Mus tree (Fig. 2) , there are no substitutions in either gene. Although this did not substantially affect our conclusions, it does indicate that tests designed for less-diverged sequences are preferable. One such test showed that Jarid1d has significantly more replacement substitutions than Jarid1c has. This result is consistent with a three-taxon study of Jar-id1c/d in human, mouse, and horse, in which the median dN/dS was 0.17 for Jarid1d and 0.02 for Jar-id1c (Agulnik et al. 1997) . Though the exact numbers reported by Agulnik et al. (1997) differ from those that we find using other methods, this indicates that there are relatively more replacement substitutions in Jarid1d in both closely related and distantly related taxa.",

This is not necessarily what would be expected based on the length of time that Jarid1d and Jarid1c have been diverging from one another. The mammalian X and Y likely diverged from each other in a series of steps, separated by time. The present-day signatures of these steps are strata, defined by the synonymous distance between pairs of gametologs on the X and Y (Lahn and Page 1999). The gene pairs Sox3/Sry, Zfx/y, and Jarid1c/d diverged at different times as shown by the X chromosomal strata of the X chromosomal members of the pairs (Lahn and Page 1999; Sandstedt and Tucker 2004). Since Jarid1c is either in X chromosomal stratum 1 or 2, it has been diverging from Jarid1d longer than Zfx [dN/dS = 0.04 (Tucker et al. 2003) ], a stratum 3 gene, has been diverging from Zfy [dN/dS = 0.38 (Tucker et al. 2003) ]. The relatively subtle difference between Jarid1d\u00d5s and Jarid1c\u00d5s dN/ dS may be due to greater functional constraints on Jarid1d than on other Y chromosomal genes or to lesser functional constraint on Jarid1c than on other X chromosomal genes (in the part of the gene studied) ( Table 2 ). Data from Wyckoff et al. (2002) also show that the difference in dN/dS between Jarid1d and Jarid1c is smaller than the difference between several other X-Y gene pairs in pairwise comparisons of mouse genes with human genes. Another implication of the position of these gene pairs in strata, which diverged at different times, is that the elevated dN/dS of Y chromosomal genes cannot be completely attributed to positive selection for new functions. If Y chromosomal genes gained new functions soon after they stopped recombining with their X chromosomal gametologs, they would have many nonsynonymous changes during that time, but few later after their new functions were obtained (Wyckoff et al. 2002) . That pattern has not been seen in mouse X-Y gene pairs from strata 1 through 3; instead a high nonsynonymous substitution rate continues along recent branches within the genus Mus, not just in ancestral portions of the mammalian tree (current study; Tucker and Lundrigan 1993; Tucker et al. 2003) .",

The sequence of Mus musculus Jarid1a was not alignable with this region. About 120 amino acids could be aligned with confidence between the Jarid1b/c/d genes. There are no nonsynonymous changes in Jarid1c in this region and five nonsynonymous changes in Jarid1d. No nonsynonymous substitutions of Jarid1d change amino acids that are conserved in both Jarid1b and Jarid1c. This may indicate that Jarid1d remains evolutionarily constrained by specific, important codons, perhaps because of a need for dosage compensation relative to Jarid1c.",

Jarid1d is functionally constrained and ubiquitously expressed, while its Xlinked gametolog Jarid1c escapes X inactivation to some degree in many tissues. We find that there are more nonsynonymous changes in Jarid1d than in Jaird1c, but it is a subtle difference relative to other X/Y gene pairs. Together these factors suggest that dosage requirements have had a greater impact on the evolution of Jarid1d than male-specific functions.",

The Y chromosomal effect occurs for genes with different expression patterns, found in one or many copies. The X chromosomal gametologs of these genes differ in their X inactivation patterns and their strata. Taken together, these observations suggest that (1) a higher dN/dS is a constant feature of Y chromosomal gene evolution, which is not limited to a burst of nonsynonymous change soon after X-Y gene pair divergence and (2) it occurs in dissimilar genes. The results reported herein were obtained from gametologs assumed to be functionally equivalent, using closely related taxa, and in a well-supported phylogenetic context. Indeed, they are in accord with and strengthen the results of a pairwise comparison of six X-Y gametologs in distantly related mammals in which the dN/dS was always higher in the Y chromosomal gene (Wyckoff et al. 2002) .

The dN/dS of Sry and Zfy are also higher than the dN/dS of their X chromosomal gametologs, Sox3 and Zfx (Pamilo and Waugh O\u00d5Neill 1997;Wyckoff et al. 2002;Tucker et al. 2003) (Table 2). The results of previous research on Sry and Zfy are compatible with either a Y chromosomal effect on the efficiency of purifying selection or alternate explanations invoking locus-specific effects such as adaptive evolution or relaxed functional constraints(Tucker and Lundrigan 1993;Whitfield et al. 1993; Hurst 1994a, b; Lee et al. 1995;Tucker et al. 2003). If unique properties of the Y chromosome are responsible for the patterns of evolution in Sry and Zfy, a similar pattern should be seen in other Y chromosomal genes, including Jarid1d.However, it is possible that the relatively high dN/dS of Sry and Zfy is a result of natural selection on gene functions that have changed compared with their counterparts on the X chromosome.
