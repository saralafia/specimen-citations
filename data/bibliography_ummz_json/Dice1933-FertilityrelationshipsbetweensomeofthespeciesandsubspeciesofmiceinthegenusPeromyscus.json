However, some species and subspecies have proved to be only moderately fertile, while a few forms so far have failed entirely to reproduce in captivity.",

Enders, Julius Haverson, Paul Hickie, Arthur A description of reproduction in the mice of this genus has been given by Svihla. 2 My method of making matings is to place the male and the female together in a freshly cleaned cage. Under conditions strange to both they are less likely to fight than if one be introduced into the cage of the other. Fighting does occur between some newly mated individuals, especially when the members of the pair are of different races, and sometimes one or both animals may be injured or killed. To secure harmonious matings between distinct species it is desirable to mate the animals when they are very young-weaning time is the best age. An old animal is likely to fight to the death if placed with an individual of another species. The mated pairs are left together constantly. The matings are considered to be failures if no young are produced in a period of four or more months during spring, summer, or autumn, which are the seasons of greatest sexual activity. However, many of the matings have been continued for a year or more.",
