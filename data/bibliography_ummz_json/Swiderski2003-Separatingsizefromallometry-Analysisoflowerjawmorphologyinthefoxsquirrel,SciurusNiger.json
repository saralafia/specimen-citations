    "abstract": "The fundamentals of mechanics provide a strong basis for the hypothesis that allometry could be an important constraint on evolutionary changes in shape. Empirical evidence that allometry accounts for sufficient shape variation to be an effective constraint is much weaker. Numerous studies claim to show that most shape variation is correlated with size, but nearly all these studies use morphometric methods that confound size and shape. Consequently, the proportion of the shape variation correlated with size remains unknown. To address this issue, I examined ontogenetic change and adult variation in lower jaws of the fox squirrel, Sciurus niger. Jaw morphologies were quantified using traditional distance measurements and geometric shape variables computed from landmark coordinates. The same analyses were performed on each data set. As expected, analyses of the distance measurements found that allometry accounted for nearly all ontogenetic variation. The same analysis on the coordinate data found that allometry accounts for \u03fd50% of the ontogenetic variation in shape. In analyses of adults, allometry explained \u03fe50% of the variation in distance measurements but \u03fd25% of the variation in shape. These results confirm that analyses of distance measurements confound size and shape and that this can lead to erroneous claims about the importance of allometry.",

                "text": "There are good theoretical reasons to expect large and small animals to differ in shape. Simple mechanical principals predict changes in proportions as size changes (Alexander 1985; Gould 1966; Hylander 1985; McMahon 1973) . These scaling rules predict changes in proportions during growth and differences in proportions among individuals at the same stage of growth (Huxley 1932) . Evolutionary changes also are expected to follow these scaling rules (Gould 1974 (Gould , 1984 Stanley 1974; Swartz 1997; Werdelin 1989) . Thus, mechanical principals support the view that allometry is an important component of intraspecific variation and can be a determinant of the direction of evolutionary change, a view * Correspondent: dlswider@umich.edu which has had a profound influence on the development of evolutionary theory (Alberch et al. 1979; Gould 1977 Gould , 1989 Lande 1985; McKinney 1986; Wagner 1988; Zeng 1988) .",

Without independent variables, it is impossible to know whether an allometric vector represents a large proportion of the shape variation or just a large proportion of the size variation. Decomposition of raw data into independent size and shape variables can be done only by factoring out differences in Mosimann's (1970) geometric scale, which is any function of the entire data set that scales by a constant when each datum is scaled by that same constant (Bookstein 1989a) . Jungers et al. (1995) demonstrated that use of any other variable to represent size confounds size and shape and necessarily leads to erroneous conclusions, such as inferring shape differences between geometrically scaled objects.",

Shape is a feature of a configuration of landmarks that is not altered by changes in geometric scale (Kendall 1977) . In other words, shape refers to the relative positions of the points, independent of the magnitudes of the interlandmark distances. Rescaling by centroid size, dividing all coordinates of a specimen's landmarks by its centroid size, divides all interlandmark distances by the same factor. The resulting configuration has the original shape and a centroid size of 1. Procrustes superimposition uses this rescaling, with operations that remove differences in location and orientation, to produce sets of landmark coordinates that reflect only the shape differences among specimens (Rohlf 1996) . These coordinates can be used to compute shape variables that describe the differences (Bookstein 1996a (Bookstein , 1996b Rohlf 1996; Rohlf et al. 1996) .",

This approach also permits evaluation of the proportion of shape variation that is associated with size variation. Numerous studies have exploited these advantages (e.g., Klingenberg and McIntyre 1998; O'Higgins and Jones 1998; Rohlf et al. 1996; Swiderski 1993; Zelditch and Fink 1995; Zelditch et al. 1992 Zelditch et al. , 1993 , but none has presented a direct comparison of results from traditional and geometric methods. In this study, both distance-and coordinatebased analyses were used to examine allometry of the lower jaw of the fox squirrel, Sciurus niger. The primary goal of this study was to determine whether these approaches to quantifying variation lead to substantially different conclusions about the pattern of allometric shape variation and the proportion of the total shape variation explained by the allometric pattern. Two distance-based measurement sets and a coordinate-based geometric data set were used to collect data on variation of lower-jaw morphology in S. niger. One of the distance-based sets was modeled on the small number of measurements traditionally used to quantify jaw morphology (Abdala et al. 2001; Emerson and Radinsky 1980; P\u00e9rez-Barber\u00eda and Gordon 1999; Ruedas 1998; Werdelin 1989 ). The other distance-based measurement set is a truss (Strauss and Bookstein 1982) and includes several additional measurements in a greater variety of directions and spans a greater number of landmarks. This set more closely approximates the amount of shape information captured by the geometric analysis, which allows the effect of the amount of information to be separated from the effect of the different methods.",

These rodents have a reputation for morphological conservatism and frequent convergence, which is largely based on systematic analyses that report few consistent qualitative differences among taxa (Black 1963; Bryant 1945; Hafner 1984; Hoffmeister and Hoffmeister 1991; Howell 1938; Thorington and Darrow 1996; Thorington et al. 1997) . Quantitative studies support the inference that evolutionary changes tend to follow an allometric trajectory (Hafner 1984; Heaney 1985; Velhagen and Roth 1997) . High correlations among distance measurements taken on S. niger skulls (Olson and Miller 1958) appear to explain the lack of divergence. The high correlations limit variation and thus evolutionary change to a single axis; evolution along this axis will only occur during the rare times when selection favors change in that particular direction. The principal problem with this explanation is that Olson and Miller (1958) analyzed only 1 population, so there is no information about the stability of integration. More recent studies document divergence of means among populations in Sciurus species (Barnett 1977; Havera and Nixon 1978; Moncrief 1993) but do not evaluate patterns of variation. To evaluate the stability of allometric patterns, the same series of analyses were performed on adults in 2 geographic samples of S. niger and on ontogenetic variation in 1 of these samples.",

The specimens were collected from 2 localities in the southern part of Michigan's Lower Peninsula, separated by about 150 km. Previous studies have documented genetic or size differences between populations separated by similar distances (Barnett 1977; Havera and Nixon 1978; Moncrief 1993) . The sample from Allegan County includes 69 specimens trapped during a single winter at a 40-acre site on the western side of the peninsula (Allen, in litt.). Body mass at time of capture was recorded for 68 specimens. All individuals have complete adult dentition. The sample from Washtenaw County includes 31 specimens trapped on the eastern side of the peninsula over several years and within 15 km of the museum. In this sample, 23 individuals have complete adult dentition, and 8 are juveniles. Individuals in each sample were grouped into age classes based on number of adult cheek teeth present (Table 1 ). According to Hench et al. (1984) , individuals with all 4 adult cheek teeth were divided into 3 subclasses based on amount of tooth wear on the upper molars: 4a, little or no wear, cusps and crests may be rounded but dentine is not exposed except in isolated pits; 4b, intermediate wear; and 4c, extensive tooth wear that nearly obliterates the cusps, exposing large ''lakes'' of dentine. of right and left lower jaws in lateral view. Squirrel jaws are relatively flat; except for the medial and posterolateral corners of the angular process, the features of interest lie in or near a single plane. To eliminate distortions due to tilting of specimens relative to the focal plane, a plane defined by 3 homologous points on the medial surface of the jaw was placed in the camera's field of view parallel to the focal plane. To eliminate distortions of the relative positions of the corners of the angular process due to parallax effects, all images were taken with the camera positioned at a sufficient distance to ensure that the specimen occupied only the part of the field known to be free of this distortion. A ruler was included in all images, in the same plane as the main body of the specimen, to permit computation of interlandmark distances and jaw size.",

To ensure that results were not affected by differences in tooth wear, landmarks 2 and 3 are on the greatest diameters of teeth, which is below the level of wear in the oldest specimens. For similar reasons, the tip of the incisor was not included in this set of landmarks. To avoid giving undue weight to the tooth row, serially homologous landmarks between landmarks 2 and 3 were excluded from the study. Preliminary analyses showed that the intermediate landmarks are strongly correlated with landmarks 2 and 3, indicating that the information provided by the omitted landmarks is redundant. To maximize sample size, landmarks 2 and 3 bracket only a portion of the tooth row (3rd molar is not included). Using landmarks that span the whole tooth row would require im-ages of the medial surface, limiting the study to a smaller number of disarticulated specimens. This would also prevent ontogenetic analyses because juveniles lack a fully erupted 3rd molar. Shortening the tooth row span further to include young juveniles lacking the 2nd or even the 1st molar was not considered because specimens this young are usually damaged and lack other landmarks.",

The only specimens included in this study were those with all 11 landmarks preserved on both sides. Preliminary analyses ruled out the presence of directional asymmetry and antisymmetry. To remove effects of fluctuating asymmetry, each specimen was represented by the average of the 2 sides. Centroid size (square root of summed squared distances of landmarks from their centroid- Slice et al. 1996) was computed for each side. The average of values for the 2 sides was used as the centroid size of that specimen. To compute the average shape, coordinates of landmarks on the right side were converted to the coordinates of its mirror image. Then, the configuration of each right side was superimposed on its left side by Procrustes superimposition, following Sneath (1967) . In this procedure, the configuration of each side was rescaled to unit centroid size by dividing the original centroid size of that side from each x and y coordinate. Then, x and y coordinates of each centroid are subtracted from the corresponding coordinates of the landmarks, superimposing each centroid on the origin of the coordinate system. Next, the configuration of the right side was rotated to minimize the Procrustes distance between sides (Procrustes distance is the square root of the sum of the squared distances between the corresponding pairs of landmarks- Slice et al. 1996) . After rotation, the average of each pair of coordinates was computed, and the set of 11 averaged landmarks was used as the average shape of the jaw for that specimen.",

This shape space is non-Euclidean, as is the surface of a 3-dimensional sphere, which means it is not possible to draw an orthogonal grid in this space. In addition, this space has fewer dimensions than there are landmark coordinates. Consequently, the landmark coordinates cannot be used in conventional multivariate analyses, such as analysis of variance (AN-OVA) or principal components analysis (PCA-Bookstein 1996a). However, each specimen's location in the non-Euclidean shape space can be projected onto a Euclidean space that is tangent to shape space and has the same number of dimensions. Following Bookstein (1996a) , the location of a sample's average shape was used as the point of tangency (reference shape) for all analyses of that sample. Axes of the tangent space are determined by eigenanalysis of a matrix computed from all interlandmark distances of the reference shape. These axes, called partial warps, are geometrically independent shape variables; each describes a pattern of relative landmark displacement. Each specimen in the sample can then be described by a set of coefficients (partial warps scores) that represent its projection onto these axes. Multiplying each partial warp score of an individual specimen by the pattern of landmark displacements of the corresponding partial warp and summing over all partial warps produces a set of landmark displacements that completely describes the shape difference between the reference shape and the specimen ( Fig. 2A) . The thin-plate spline interpolation function can be used to illustrate this shape difference as a deformed grid (Fig. 2B ). (More complete computational details can be found in Bookstein 1991 Bookstein , 1996b Rohlf 1996 ; less formal descriptions can be found in Rohlf et al. 1996; Swiderski 1993; Zelditch and Fink 1995.) The full set of partial warps scores can be analyzed in any conventional multivariate analysis to evaluate the effects of hypothesized factors on shape (Bookstein 1996a) .",

Regression was used to examine relationships of centroid size to jaw length and mass. Multivariate regression was used (where sample size permitted) to test whether variation in the full set of measurements is correlated with variation in centroid size. Principal components analysis was performed on the covariance matrix of each data set to extract scores and loadings for the 1st principal component (PC 1), which is commonly interpreted as the axis of allometric variation. (Centroid size was not included.) To determine whether PC 1 represents a meaningful axis of variation that can be interpreted as the effect of any factor, Anderson's test (Anderson 1963 ) was used to test whether the eigenvalues (variances) of PC 1 and PC 2 are distinct. This test uses a likelihood ratio statistic that has a chi-square distribution for large samples (Morrison 1976) . In effect, the test determines whether the PCs account for significantly different amounts of variation. If the eigenvalues are not significantly different, variation in the data is not significantly different from circular random variation, and the PCs are judged not to represent meaningful axes of variation.",

The value of P represents the probability that the value of the independent variable (jaw centroid size) differs among individuals in different effect groups (e.g., age classes). but statistically significant proportion of jaw size variation in adults (r 2 \u03ed 0.179, F \u03ed 14.4, d.f. \u03ed 1, 66, P \u03ed 0.0003). The slope of this regression is considerably less than 1 (slope \u03ed 0.232, SE \u03ed 0.0611, t 1 \u03ed 12.6, P \u03fd 0.0001), indicating that heavy individuals have relatively small jaws. This sample does not exhibit significant sexual dimorphism (F \u03ed 0.1231, d.f. \u03ed 1, P \u03ed 0.7268), and there was no evidence of significant weight loss during the 6-month collecting interval (F \u03ed 0.4393, d.f. \u03ed 5, P \u03ed 0.8194). Consequently, the latter factors cannot be invoked to explain the weak correlation between mass and jaw size or its low slope. This negative allometric relationship is contrary to expectations that larger individuals would need relatively larger jaws to process the food required to support their mass. Even if the relationship is too weak to be biologically meaningful, the hypothesis of positive allometry is rejected for this sample. Regression of jaw length on centroid size reveals that centroid size explains \u03fe84% of the variation in jaw length in each sample (Table 3) . During the ontogenetic interval covered by the Washtenaw sample, jaw length is negatively allometric relative to centroid size. This implies that jaw depth grows more rapidly than jaw length. In adults, regressions of jaw length on centroid size indicate similar, slightly negative allometries, but due to the small sample size, the slope in the Washtenaw adult sample cannot be judged as significantly different from 1. Jaw size and jaw shape (traditional data).-Multivariate regression of the natural logs of the 9 traditional measurements on the natural log of centroid size is highly significant for all 3 samples (Table 4 ). The patterns of allometric shape change inferred from coefficients of regressions are strikingly different (Fig. 3) . The only features common to all 3 patterns are negative allometry of the visible portion of the tooth row and positive allometry of the depth of the angular process. The 2 adult samples also share positive allometry of diastema length and negative allometry of incisor alveolus diameter, which is more than either TABLE 3.-Regression of jaw length on centroid size in each sample. r 2 \u03ed correlation coefficient, the proportion of variance in jaw length explained by variance centroid size, F \u03ed F-ratio from the corresponding analysis of variance, d.f. \u03ed degrees of freedom, P F \u03ed probability that an F-value greater than or equal to the observed value could be obtained by chance. The slope of the regression was estimated for each sample, along with the SE of the estimate. The value of t is computed for the hypothesis that the slope is equal to 1, i.e., (1 \u03ea slope)/SE. The value of P t is the probability that a t value greater than or equal to the observed value could be obtained by chance and thus represents the probability of an isometric relationship between jaw length and centroid size. Wilks' \u2333 is a test statistic for multivariate analysis of variance, F is the corresponding F-ratio representing variance explained by the independent variable (centroid size) divided by the unexplained variance. The d.f. values are determined by the number of variables in the measurement set and the number of individuals in the sample. The P-value is the probability that an F-value greater than or equal to the observed value could be obtained by chance and thus represents the probability of an isometric relationship between jaw shape and centroid size. The analysis could not be performed on the truss set for Washtenaw adults because the sample size does not exceed the number of measurements. adult sample shares with the Washtenaw ontogenetic series. It is not clear from the multivariate regression what proportion of the observed variation is explained by allometry or whether these patterns represent significant deviations from isometry. PCA helps address the 1st question because regression cannot account for more variance than PC 1. The 2nd question is addressed by comparing the width of the 95% CI around the observed allometric vector (coefficients of the multivariate regression) with the angular distance between the observed vector and the expected vector under isometry (all coefficients equal 1.0).",

In all 3 samples, the angle between the observed allometric vector and the expected isometry vector is slightly larger for truss data than for traditional data (Table 6 ). However, CI around the observed vectors also are larger, and in cases of the adult samples, the CI values include the isometry vector. Consequently, variation in the adult samples is not significantly differ-ent from the pattern expected under isometry. In the ontogenetic series, the angular deviation from isometry is still quite small; it has only increased from 21.4 to 25.0\u040a.

Patterns of allometric shape change inferred from geometric data (Fig. 5) are broadly similar to those inferred from truss measurements, but there also are several important differences. In the Washtenaw ontogenetic series, the geometric data provide much clearer evidence that the dental ramus is thickening below the masseteric fossa faster than it is above the fossa. It is also more obvious that the angular process is expanding posteriorly more than ventrally and that the angular process is not expanding anteriorly under the tooth row. In the Washtenaw adults, the principal allometric differences are that larger individuals have a smaller condyle, a shallower angular process, and a masseteric fossa that extends more anteriorly. In the Allegan sample, larger individuals are distinguished by a relatively large angular process (both deeper and longer) and by relatively small distances from the teeth to the condyle and the tip of the coronoid process. Because the amount of shape change that is correlated with increasing centroid size is quite small, other changes in proportions inferred from the truss data have inconsequential effects on shape.

This diversity indicates that allometric patterns of tree squirrels are labile and that they are able to respond to local selection pressures. This flexibility argues against the idea that allometric patterns are constraints. Even if tree squirrel allometries were more stable, the small amount of shape variation explained by allometric patterns suggests that they would have little power to direct evolutionary change.

The authors of this hypothesis argue that lack of a bias in the pattern of variation will make selection ineffective and its consequences unpredictable. However, before testing alternative explanations for conservatism and frequent convergence, it might be wise to reexamine the evidence for these patterns. In taxa that differ in size, distance measurements will be prone to confound size and shape in the same way as observed in the ontogenetic analysis presented in this article. If this is the case, then size differences may not predict shape differences as precisely as previous papers have implied.

Systems of measurement similar to the traditional set examined in this study have been used to examine patterns of variation in other structures and other taxa (e.g., Abdala et al. 2001; Danforth 1989; Gould 1974; Strauss 1985) . If the proportion of shape variation explained by allometry in these studies is inflated to the same degree, the true role of allometry as a constraint on evolutionary change may be much smaller than it is widely perceived to be. This does not mean that the scaling rules at the core of this paradigm are invalid. Rather, it means that there is more to shape than proportions of lever arms. Different local features could be altered to produce the same net effect on the mechanical properties of a biological lever system such as the lower jaw. Accordingly, the evolution of morphology may be much more interesting than one might guess from traditional morphometric results.",
