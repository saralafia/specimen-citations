The current view is that molar teeth evolved from simple conical teeth, similar to canines, by progressive addition of extra \"cones\" to form progressively complex multicuspid crowns. Mammalian incisors, however, are neither conical nor multicuspid, and their evolution is unclear. We show that hypomorphic mutation of a cell surface receptor, Lrp4, which modulates multiple signaling pathways, produces incisors with grooved enamel surfaces that exhibit the same molecular characteristics as the tips of molar cusps. Mice with a null mutation of Lrp4 develop extra cusps on molars and have incisors that exhibit clear molar-like cusp and root morphologies. Molecular analysis identifies misregulation of Shh and Bmp signaling in the mutant incisors and suggests an uncoupling of the processes of tooth shape determination and morphogenesis. Incisors thus possess a developmentally suppressed, cuspid crown-like morphogenesis program similar to that in molars that is revealed by loss of Lrp4 activity. Several mammalian species naturally possess multicuspid incisors, suggesting that mammals have the capacity to form multicuspid teeth regardless of location in the oral jaw. Localized loss of enamel may thus have been an intermediary step in the evolution of cusps, both of which use Lrp4-mediated signaling.",

Even quite closely related species of mammals can have different shapes of teeth and thus tooth development provides an excellent model for molecularly based evolutionary developmental biological studies (evo/devo). These tooth evolutional changes took place by the activation or inactivation of gene function, and thus evolutionary lost structures or gene activation/inactivation during evolution are occasionally retained as vestigial structures or latent gene activation/inactivation at embryonic stages.",

Mammalian heterodont dentitions contain a variety of tooth shapes and most evo/devo studies have focused solely on the molar dentition, with cuspal morphology being used as the main comparative feature between specimens (1). A cusp is a pointed or rounded projection of the tooth that is composed of both enamel and dentin, and the general consensus is that multicuspid teeth (molariform) evolved from conical teeth by progressive addition of extra \"cones\" (1). Incisors however are a uniquely mammalian tooth type that are neither conical nor multicuspid and their evolutional process is not understood.",

A major defining feature of Rodentia is the presence of continuously growing incisors. Most mammalian teeth consist of a clearly recognizable crown that consists of a thin coating of enamel covering a thicker layer of dentine, and roots that are composed only of dentine that is often surrounded by an external layer of a supporting tissue (e.g., periodontal ligament). Rodent incisors, however, have no obvious crown or roots but have two distinct surfaces: a labial surface of enamelcovered dentine and lingual surface of dentine only. It has been suggested that the labial side corresponds to the crown and the lingual side corresponds to the root (2, 3) .",

The Shh pathway plays a critical role in ameloblast differentiation, the cells that co-ordinate enamel formation (10, 11) . In frontal sections of wild-type laboratory mice, the Shh receptor Ptc1 was expressed in ameloblasts at the presumptive groove region, and Shh was expressed uniformly in ameloblasts ( Fig. 1 G and I). Gli1 was also strongly expressed at the presumptive groove region ( Fig. 1J ). This indicates Shh activity in the ameloblasts of wild-type incisors at the position where the groove forms in the mutants. In the Lrp4 hypo/hypo mutant, Shh expression in ameloblasts was generally downregulated, but a clear area of greatly reduced expression corresponded to the site of groove formation (Fig. 1H ). An accompanying downregulation of Ptc1 and Gli1 expression was also observed at the presumptive groove region in Lrp4 hypo/hypo mice (Fig. S1 ). To establish any causal link between loss of Shh activity and groove formation, we analyzed mice with mutations in the Shh pathway that survive after birth. The spontaneous mouse mutant, mesenchymal dysplasia, has an abnormal C terminus of the Ptc1 protein (Ptc mes/mes ) that changes Shh activity (12) (13) (14) . The maxillary incisors of these mice had grooves on their labial surfaces that were also caused by a lack of enamel ( Fig. 1 K and L) . This suggests that lowering of Shh activity in postnatal ameloblasts can lead to localized loss of enamel, in turn leading to the formation of labial grooves.",

Before eruption of rodent molar teeth, the enamel-free zones are covered by ameloblasts, similar to those observed in the grooved incisors of Lrp4 hypo/hypo mice ( Fig. 1 F and S) . To determine whether a conserved mechanism exists between lack of enamel on molar cusp tips and on grooved incisors, we compared the expression of genes known to be expressed during ameloblast differentiation in molars. Downregulation of Bmp4 expression, seen in the presumptive groove region of Lrp4 hypo/hypo mice, was also observed in ameloblasts covering the enamel-free zones of wild-type molar teeth (Fig. 1T) . A more specific marker of the enamel-free zone is expression of Slit1, which shows a localized patch of expression in ameloblasts at the tips of developing molar cusps (19, 20) . Weak Slit1 expression was observed in odontoblasts of wild-type mouse incisors with a very small faint patch of expression at the groove location site at birth (Fig. 1U) . In Lrp4 hypo/ hypo mice, Slit1 expression was increased in odontoblasts, and the patch of expression in ameloblasts at the groove location site was clearly visible (Fig. 1V) . Thus the site of the formation of incisor labial grooves shares molecular characteristics with the molar enamel-free zone. Alteration of Shh or Bmp signaling pathways either directly (Ptc mes/mes , K14-Noggin) or indirectly via hypomorphic mutation of Lrp4 reveals the cryptic incisor enamel-free zone. The existence of a very weak patch of Slit1 expression in wildtype incisors at the position where a groove forms in the mutants, together with expression of Ptc1 and Gli1 in this same small region, all of which show changes in Lrp4 hypo/hypo mice, suggests that this region of ameloblasts may be different from all other ameloblasts in the incisors. The obvious interpretation of these expression patterns is that ameloblasts in this region have compromised mineralization capacity. However, no obvious changes in enamel across the width of wild-type incisors have ever been reported.",

We also reasoned that any defect in the ability of these cells to form enamel would be small and thus might only be evident in older mice. We thus analyzed the incisors of wild-type C57/BL6 mice that were 2 years old, and found very clear evidence of labial grooves as a result of a lack of enamel ( Fig. 1 W and X) . This suggests that the ameloblasts that coordinate enamel formation in the region of the groove become defective with age. Because ameloblasts in murine incisors are continually produced from the cervical loop stem cells, this may indicate age-related and location-specific defects in these cells (21) .",

Although rodents mostly have smooth incisors, we found grooved incisors in 60 rodents among 300 species investigated ( Fig. S3 and Tables S1-S3). Labial grooves are also seen in species usually considered to be outside what are strictly considered as Rodentia, namely lagomorphs (picas, rabbits, and hares), which also possess lifelong continuously growing incisors (Fig. 2C) . Cross-section analysis of the grooved incisors of several wild-type rodent species showed that the grooves were caused by a reduction of enamel on the labial surface (Fig.  2 D-F) . Some fossil rodents also had grooved incisors, indicating that the labial grooves may have been lost in certain rodents, including Mus musculus, during evolution (Figs. S3 and S4) (23) . In addition to rodent teeth, the enamel-free zone can also be observed in African cichlid fishes, suggesting that enamel-free zones are conserved structures in vertebrates ( Fig. 2 G and H) .",

When we examined the incisors of Lrp4 null mutant mice, we found a more severe phenotype than Lrp4 hypo/hypo mice. Lrp4 null mutant incisors exhibited folded enamel and dentin on the labial side that was not observed in Lrp4 hypo/hypo mice (Fig. 4B) . Slit1, a marker of tertiary enamel knots as well as the enamel-free zone, was found in the tooth epithelium corresponding to the folded enamel/dentin in the mutant incisors (Fig. 4C) (19, 20) . This suggests that the folded enamel/dentin represents a cusp-like structure. These mutant incisors are thus reminiscent of multicuspid crowns. Interestingly, multiple grooves (enamel-free zones) were also occasionally observed in Lrp4 hypo/hypo and several rodent species (Fig. 2 B  and I) . In molars, cusp formation is initiated by a transient epithelial structure, the primary enamel knot (24, 25) . To establish any link between Lrp4, primary enamel knots and cusp morphogenesis, we examined the expression of Lrp4, Wnt10b, and p21 during incisor development. The enamel knot marker genes, Wnt10b and p21 showed restricted coexpression with Lrp4 in incisor tooth epithelium (Fig. 4 D-F) . Interestingly, Lrp4 expression was also observed in the primary enamel knot in the molars (8) . These results suggest that the role of Lrp4 in incisors is probably similar to that in molars. Interestingly, Lrp4 null mice also had extra molar cusps, suggesting that Lrp4 might have a general role in suppressing cusp formation ( Fig. 4 H, J, and L) .",

The lingual portion of the incisors also showed a discontinuity of epithelium that is not a normal feature of lingual incisor epithelium ( Fig. 4 M and N) . The apical edge of lingual epithelium histologically resembled an epithelial root sheath that is a unique structure found in developing molar tooth roots (Hertwig's epithelial root sheath; 3, 26). Ptc2 expression, a marker of Hertwig's epithelial root sheath in molars (14) , was clearly identified in the apical edge of epithelium of the incisors of Lrp4 null mutants (Fig. 4O ), suggesting that in the absence of Lrp4, epithelial cells on the lingual aspect of developing incisors were organized into root-forming structures usually seen in only molars. The existence of both a crown with multiple cusp-like structure and molar-type roots indicates that the Lrp4 null mutant incisors have undergone a transformation toward molars. To investigate this further, we examined the expression of molar mesenchyme marker Barx1 in the mutant incisors (27) . Barx1 expression could not be detected in the incisors of Lrp4 null mice, suggesting that the mesenchyme of Lrp4 null mutant incisors has retained its incisor identity ( Fig. 4 P and Q) . The existence of cusp-like structures with enamel-free zones in the epithelium of Lrp4 null mutant incisors, together with the retention of incisor identity in the mesenchyme identifies an uncoupling of the processes of tooth shape determination (mesenchyme) and morphogenesis (epithelium). Interestingly, multicuspid incisors that are composed of folded enamel/dentin with enamel-free zones are naturally found in some mammalian species (Fig. 4 R-U) . Furthermore, several extinct mammalian species also had multicuspid incisors (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) (33) .",

Gaining cusps has been established as a major event in mammalian evolution. In East African cichlid fish, some species show tooth crown shape reversal where monocuspid teeth evolved from multicuspid teeth (35, 36) . Interestingly, dolphins also possess a homodont conical tooth dentition whereas the primitive eutherian heterodont dentition included multicuspid teeth (1). Lrp4 hypo/hypo mice show enamel-free zones in in- cisors and Lrp4 null mice exhibit a more severe phenotype of incisors with multiple cusp-like structures with enamel-free zones (Fig. 4V) .",

In some species this program is less suppressed, leading to incisors with obvious cuspidlike morphologies. Naturally occurring grooved incisors may represent a vestigial remnant of this suppressed molar program. Multiple signaling pathways are involved in cusp formation; in this context it is significant that Lrp4 is a known direct mediator of both Wnt and Bmp signaling and an indirect mediator of Shh (8, 9) and thus may have played a pivotal role in evolution of heterodontia (Fig. 4V ). Lrp4 via its action on multiple signaling pathways including Shh, Bmp, and Wnt is thus central to a transition between a continuous enamel covering, grooved enamel, and folded enamel, all of which appear in the mammalian fossil record and extant species and raise the question of whether enamel grooves proceeded enamel folds in the evolution of multicuspid teeth.",
