We have recently identified a group of South American rodents, including rice rats (Oryzomys), in which L1s appear to be quiescent or extinct. Several observations support this conclusion. First, genomic Southern blot analysis fails to reveal genus-specific bands in Oryzomys. Second, we were unable to find recently inserted elements. Procedures to enrich for young elements did not yield any with an intact open reading frame for reverse transcriptase; all elements isolated had numerous insertions, deletions, and stop codons. Phylogenetic analysis failed to yield species-specific clusters among the L1 elements isolated, and all Oryzomys sequences had numerous private mutations. Finally, in situ hybridization of L1 to Oryzomys chromosomes failed to reveal the characteristic L1 distribution in Oryzomys with either a homologous or heterologous probe.

For a variety of technical reasons, these were not detected in either Oryzomys or Holochilus with any of the six enzymes used. The conservation of numbers cannot be extrapolated to estimate the percentage of L1 elements in the genome that are active, these bands across genera, the faintness of hybridization relative to Sigmodon, and the ability to detect active or even relatively young. For example, PCR itself enriches for younger elements. However, these numbers subfamilies in a much more distant genus suggest that the L1 elements in Oryzomys and Holochilus have not do indicate that L1 elements have been recently quite active in these rodent genomes.

Because cosuppression would be correlated with the level of transcription, suppression might be greatest when there are large numbers of active templates and be reduced when the number of active templates falls. Thus, during periods of cosuppression, few new templates would be produced, but when the number of active elements in a species falls below some critical level, cosuppression would be lifted and many new, closely related templates might be produced. Cosuppression may thus have properties that are especially attractive to explain the enigmatic characteristics of L1 lineages discussed above, but the details of this phenomenon are not well understood and its role in regulating L1 expression remains speculative.",
