Another female dog in heat was placed frequently with the male coyote between January 4 to 11, 1938, again without a successful copulation, although the coyote attempted a few times to mount her. The male coyote was about 1G months old in the summer of 1937 and probably nearly two years of age in January of 1938, and he should accordingly have been mature. It is possible that the male might not have been in breeding condition in the summer, but this could not have been true in January. The failure to breed may have been due to the distractions caused by the presence of other animals, especially the nearhy bears, or the whole artificial situation may have prevented the instinets of the male from properly expressing themselves.",

The maturation divisions, on the contrary, seem to be highly abnormal. No divisions are found in any stage later than very early anaphase of the first maturation division. Mter this stage only abnormal cells are to be found. Many degenerate cells are present in the lumens of the seminiferous tubules and a few in the epididymis, but no spermatozoa occur in either the testis or epididymis. These observations have been confirmed by Professor Peter Okkelberg. It is true that this hybrid male was immature and partially paralyzed. Nevertheless, it would be expected that in a normal animal of this age maturation of the germ cells would be in progress. The indication is, therefore, that this hybrid would have been sterile, because of the failure of production of spermatozoa.",

The hair of the hybrids was much shorter in length than that of the coyote, and was probably not much, if any, longer than that of the hound. The size of ear, heaviness of muzzle, width of skull, and thickness of limb bones of the hybrids seem to be in general intermediate between the two parent forms.
