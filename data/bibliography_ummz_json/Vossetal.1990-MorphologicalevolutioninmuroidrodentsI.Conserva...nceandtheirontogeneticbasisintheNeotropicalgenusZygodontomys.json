Analyses of variance based on toothwear (a coarse index of age) and sex in the wild-collected samples, and on known age and sex in a captive-bred population, reveal that specimen scores on sample first principal components are age-and sex-dependent; residual sample dispersion, however, is essentially unaffected by age, sex, or age x sex interaction. The sample first principal component therefore reflects the covariance among measured dimensions induced by general growth, and its coefficients are interpretable as exponents ofpostnatal growth allometry. Path-analytic models that incorporate prior knowledge of the equivalent allometric effects of general growth within these samples can be used to decompose the between-sample variance by factors corresponding to other ontogenetic mechanisms of form change.

Neotropical savanna mice (Zygodontomys) are morphologically distinctive muroid rodents that occur from Costa Rica through Panama, Colombia, Venezuela, the Guianas, and northern Brazil (Voss, 1991) . Many populations from localities scattered throughout this geographic range are represented by large samples in museum collections, and Zygodontomys are easily raised in the laboratory (Aguilera, 1985; Voss et al., 1990 ). Here we report analyses ofcranial morphometric variation within wild-coilected population samples and in a captivebred colony of Zygodontomys. From these we identify covariance patterns that provide evidence for latent form-determining factors with consistent effects from population to population. A model for path analysis incorporating knowledge of this withinsample factor structure is used to partition the between-sample variation into components for which different ontogenetic explanations are available. We suggest that phylogenetic comparisons and hybridization experiments based in the logic of such analyses can facilitate the identification of evolutionary regularities in the genetic systems responsible for morphological differences among natural populations, species, and higher taxa.",

Each sample consists ofanimals trapped from an area no more than 10 km in diameter over a period no longer than 6 months. Wee conjecture that specimens grouped by these spatiotemporal criteria represent normal patterns of phenotypic variability maintained among contemporaneous individuals within panmictic populations. The abbreviation and name by which each sample is identified in our analyses are provided below followed by the sample size and sex composition (in parentheses), geographic origin, collection dates, and the abbreviation of the museum or museums (see Acknowledgments) in which the sample is located. Age Criteria. -Molar toothwear provides the only criterion by which the age of wildcollected specimens of Zygodontomys can be judged. Erosion of the molar crowns is a monotonic process that reduces the enameled cusps and crests of youthful teeth to shallow basins of dentine worn to the gums in senescent animals. The progress ofmolar toothwear is marked by the sequential obliteration of various details of occlusal morphology, and specimens can be ranked by such details into classes of greater or lesser wear. Since toothwear is correlated with time during individual lifespans, toothwear classes are commonly regarded as age classes in muroid systematic studies, but this plausible equivalence is subject to important qualifications. First, the variation in rates of dental attrition among contemporaneous individuals within populations is not known, so that the most that can safely be inferred is that for classes ranked in order of increasing wear, the average age of specimens in a class of higher rank exceeds the average age of specimens in a class oflower rank. Second, the variability of average attrition schedules over years or seasons at one locality, or among localities, is also unknown, so that specimens ofthe same tooth-wear class from different years or localities are not necessarily of comparable average age. Molar toothwear therefore provides only an approximate index of relative age within spatiotemporally homogeneous samples.",

For the purposes of the present report, subsequent phylogenetic comparisons, and future genetic analyses, measurements were selected (1) to sample variation in diverse aspects of eraniodental morphology (e.g., the dentition, facial skeleton, and neurocranium), (2) to be anatomically homologous from specimen to specimen within and among populations or species, and (3) to be determinable with minimal error (high repeatability). Since for each additional dimension measured the number of specimens with complete data is diminished (skulls are often broken, chipped, or otherwise damaged), some compromise between detailed measurement protocols on the one hand and robust estimation of multivariate statistics on the other is unavoidable.",

By contrast, the inconsistent orientation ofsubsequent components (compared among populations) coupled with the observation that adjacent eigenvalues after the first are seldom very different invites the suspicion that variation is often nearly isotropic in directions orthogonal to the principal axis and that the direction ofmost calculated minor axes may largely reflect sampling error. This inference is supported by the results ofbootstrap analyses and by asymptotic statistics. Bootstrapestimated means divided by their standard errors yield very large t values in all populations for most variable coefficients on the first but not on subsequent principal components. Anderson's x 2 statistic attains improbably large values (P < 0.001) for every sample under the null hypothesis that the first and second eigenvalues are equal, but tests ofequality for the second through sixth eigenvalues are seldom significant.

Since sample similarities in patterns of relative variability and cor- relation are mirrored by resemblances in first principal components, but not in subsequent eigenvectors (which have much smaller and usually indistinct eigenvalues), we infer that a single factor effectively accounts for most of the common latent determination ofthese sample dispersions. Of biological causes that might be responsible only two, age-correlated growth, and sex, are accessible for scrutiny. Unfortunately, the estimation ofvariance components is compromised in most samples by the grossly unbalanced distribution of specimens among \"age\" (toothwear) and sex classes; the analytic effects of such imbalance are evident when estimated variance components differ greatly between models in which sex or \u00abage\" is first specified. Only for three almost-balanced samples, Cerro Azul, Dividive, and Hato \u00a31Frio, do estimates differ negligibly (by about 1-5%) between models that differ in priority assigned to sex and \u00abage.\" Since results are similar for all three samples analyzed both ways, only one analysis, of Dividive with sex entered first, is presented here (Table 6 ). In accordance with prior caveats regarding inferences based on molar toothwear (see Materials and Methods), the heuristic aspect of this exercise should be emphasized: no biological significance can be attached to the absolute values ofvariance components estimated from these undesigned observations. Nevertheless, the striking consistency among analyses of the three samples identified above clearly suggests the relative predominance ofvariation associated with one external criterion ofspecimen classification.",

The residual variance in all measurements is almost wholly unexplained by the model; in other words, specimen classification by sex, \"age,\" and sex x \"age\" does not account for any very large fraction ofmeasurement variance that is independent of PC 1. Interaction components of residual variance are not consistently greater than zero for any measurement in the three populations analyzed. Sex or \"age\" components of residual variance are consistently greater than zero for only four measurements. Averaging over samples and models we observe 5.7% for the \"age\" component of residual BPB, 9.5% for the sex component of residual LIB, 7.8% for the \"age\" component of residual BB, and 7.9% for the sex component of residual LOF. A conservative interpretation ofthese results is that only age (as loosely indexed by analyses offirst principal component scores and residuals. While metrical differences between males and females appear to account for a negligible fraction of the morphometric variation in natural population samples (above, and see VOSS, 1991) , tests for sex effects in captives (Table 7 ) reveal significant dimorphism in most measurements. These data are controlled in sex comparisons, however, not only for the usual conditions of nurture (food, temperature, etc.) and age, but also for family (dam and sire), and (within age Table B ). Since interaction terms are never very large (only one is marginally significant), sex differences remain approximately constant with age. F values associated with age effects are smaller for molar (LM, BM1) and neurocranial (LIB, BB) measurements than for other craniometric variables, but a statistically significant age effect for molar breadth (BM 1) is biologically uninterpretable. The molar dentition is completely erupted in age class 1 specimens and there is no mechanism in these animals for subsequent molar growth; the very small mean differences in molar breadth among age classes (less than 0.1 mm; Appendix, Table B ) must therefore result from some nonbiological agency such as inadvertent bias in assignment ofanimals to age cohorts or nonrandomly distributed measurement errors.",

For the example illustrated (Fig.  3) , the first principal components of the Montijo Bay and San Miguel Island sam-ples are only 3.8 and 4.6\u00b0, respectively, outside the plane of ordination (defined by the coefficients ofPCl c and PC2 c ; Table 10). General growth therefore corresponds in direction with the long axis of each sample dispersion in that plane; because sample first principal components are highly correlated, such axes are very nearly parallel. 2. Nonoverlapping sample dispersions projected into the plane of the first and be biologically meaningful since each often confounds covariance attributable to growth within samples and covariance that reflects growth-invariant differences between samples. Of alternative methods suggested by Burnaby (1966) , Thorpe (1983), and Bookstein et al. (1985) to address such difficulties, we provide the sheared-principal-component solution (Fig. 4) , which effects a decomposition of the between-sample variance consistent with a path-analytic model ( second combined-sample principal components are always separated along an axis that is orthogonal to the parallel axes of within-sample growth. Both the former direction, of growth-invariant sample difference, and the direction of growth within samples are usually oblique to the calculated axes of ordination. This is obvious from visual inspection ( Fig. 3 ) and may be confirmed by calculating the arc-cosines of inner products: the first principal component of the Montijo Bay sample makes acute angles of 18.3 and 72.6\u00b0with the first and second combined-sample principal components, respectively; the corresponding angles for the San Miguel Island sample are 17.6 and 73.0\u00b0. 3. All ofthe discrimination afforded by the data for such pairs of discrete samples is represented in the plane of the first and second combined-sample principal components; specimen projections on subsequent components exhibit essentially complete sample overlap.",

A predominance of positive elements in the correlation or covariance matrix may establish \"size\" as a plausible label for the leading eigenvector, but this is little more than a descriptive convention for static data where evidence of developmental cause is wanting (Cock, 1966) .

First, it is of interest to determine whether the pattern of population differences observed in Zygodontomys also obtains within other muroid genera. If the allometries of postnatal multivariate growth are generally found to be conserved among closely related populations, for example, then it would seem reasonable to hypothesize that incipient stages of morphological evolution often proceed by divergence in other aspects of development. Orthogonal displacements of parallel ontogenetic vectors in bivariate ordinations of log-transformed measurement data are commonly observed for comparisons ofconspecific breeds or congeneric species (Gould, 1971) , but the importance of preformation versus other mechanisms of differentiation for comparisons at higher levels ofrelationship requires investigation. Path analysis of multivariate differences within and among pairs of sister taxa (the latter to be identified by cladistic analyses of nonmetrical characters) might reveal phylogenetic regularities in the ontogenetic consequences of morphological evolution.",

If mean differences observed between wild-collected population samples in general size (LlS) and in size-invariant contrasts (d j ) are reproduced as well between samples from the same populations captive-bred under identical conditions of nurture, then the prima facie evidence for genetic determination would be strong. More information could be gained from the captive-bred hybrid progeny ofpopulation crosses. An increased variance ofspecimen scores on S or G (with coefficients determined by prior path analysis of parental population differences) in the captive-bred F 2 generation over the corresponding values in the F 1 would provide evidence for Mendelian inheritance. Subject to testable assumptions concerning the additivity of gene effects, random mating, and the equiprobable survival ofgenotypes during the breeding experiment, estimates could then be obtained of the minimum effective number of responsible loci (Lande, 1981) .",
