Scientific names are currently available for about two million of the eight million species estimated to live on Earth (Mora et al. 2011) . In museum and herbarium collections, researchers try to compile and organise the most complete representation of biological diversity. This is motivated not (only) because some people have a: metaphysical angst, perhaps because they cannot bear the idea of chaos being the one ruler of the universe, which is why (\u2026) they attempt to impose some order on the world\u2026 as surmised by the Nobel literature prize winner Jos\u00e9 Saramago in his book 'All the Names' (Saramago 2000) but also by the need to have reference samples to identify species, know how and where they live, their biotic and abiotic interactions, their links to communities and ecosystems, and finally, all subjects that define natural history (Tewksbury et al. 2014) .",

Specimens maintained in biological collections include the material samples on which new species are described -the type specimens -but also additional specimens that represent the variety and variability that a biologist needs to recognise to become a good practitioner of species identification. Collections are essential for taxonomic and systematic research, but also for studies in ecology, evolution, biogeography, conservation, climate change effects, and other fields, as will be discussed later in this chapter.",

With fifteen ecoregions (Olson et al. 2001; Burgess et al. 2004; , Angola is one of the most biodiverse countries of the world, so biological collections will or should reflect that diversity. The number of endemic species is recognised to be high in several groups, for example in birds (Mills and Melo 2013; Dean et al. 2019 ) and plants (Figueiredo et al. 2009a, b; Goyder and Gon\u00e7alves 2019) . However, despite this richness, the Angolan Escarpment could not be recognised as one of the biodiversity hotspots of the world due to the lack of information on its species diversity (Myers et al. 2000) . This might be a consequence of the under-representation of Angola's biological diversity in natural history collections. This situation results, in part at least, from a combination of factors like the restrictions placed on field explorations due to the war situation in the country over several decades, and to limited access to the country's natural history collections such as those of the Museu do Dundo.",

For example, in the USA, 100 herbaria have closed since 1997 (Deng 2015) . Paradoxically, the use of such collections has increased at an exponential rate in the same period (Pyke and Ehrlich 2010; Lavoie 2013) . This increase in use might be related to the fact that biodiversity informatics and cyber-infrastructure developments now contribute to compress time and space, facilitating virtual access to specimens, data and literature. A researcher of Angolan biodiversity, working in Angola or working abroad, can now access hundreds of thousands of biodiversity records online. Such databases include images of the specimens in collections hosted elsewhere in the world, and species descriptions in old or inaccessible journals. In parallel, molecular tools have recently seen great advances, with the arrival of next-generation sequencing tools that promise to overcome limitations of DNA fragmentation caused by certain preservation methods used in collections (Yeates et al. 2016 ). This will facilitate attaching genetic sequences to specimens, and support biodiversity field surveys to achieve faster results. An optimistic view is held by a group of experts who suggest that it is possible to describe ten million species in 50 years, virtually describing all species that currently remain to be discovered (Wheeler et al. 2012) . The authors conclude that this goal might be reached by interdisciplinary partnerships using and developing cyber technologies.",

The most visible facility is probably the intergovernmental Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), created in 2001, through which more than one thousand institutions share, in 2018, over one billion records, including 145 million records based on specimens preserved in collections. These records are freely and openly accessible to all using an Internet browser, at www.gbif.org. However, we are still far from having all specimens from collections catalogued in databases. In Europe, for example, only 10% of NHC specimens are digitally catalogued.

This is the case of Angola, where the highest representation of Angolan biodiversity in collections is in Portuguese or other European or North American NHCs.

We used the full dataset available through GBIF as on May 25, 2018 (GBIF.org 2018), containing 149,701 records for all groups. This was merged with other sources for specific groups, information that is not yet published by GBIF. These datasets include the database of the bird collections of the Herbarium and Museum of Ornithology and Mammalogy of Lubango (Lages 2016, pers. com.) containing 34,471 records, and the Herbarium of the University of Coimbra (Santos and Sales 2018), with 7864 herbarium records. Both resources are soon to be published through GBIF. Finally, we accessed RAINBIO (Gilles et al. 2016 ) that holds 1884 herbarium records from Angola. In the aggregated dataset, the possible duplication of records between RAINBIO and GBIF was checked and removed, as well as a careful check of the information about province, which was standardised or completed whenever possible. The total aggregated dataset for this analysis contains 193,839 records, of which 158,185 records contain information about the province and 154,631 records with information about the sampling year (Table 19 .1). These records are published by more than 200 institutions from 28 countries ( Fig. 19 .1), and should be considered a partial view of the complete holding of specimens from Angola in collections worldwide.",

Several sets of the collection were made by Welwitsch and distributed to several herbaria, but the most complete sets are located in Lisbon, at the LISU herbarium, and in the BM herbarium, in London. In total, more than 20,000 duplicates were sent to the major herbaria in Europe (Albuquerque and Correia 2010). Welwitsch sampled not only vascular plants but also cryptogams, including 350 lichen specimens with 50 type specimens, and also mammals. The most well-known and notable species he found is Welwitschia mirabilis from the Namib Desert, in southwest Angola. The genus was named in Welwitsch's honour by Sir Joseph Hooker, and is the most iconic plant species of Angola.",

Finally, after the year 2000, with the end of the civil war (in 2002), there is a recovery in the deposition of specimens into collections, but not to the levels observed before 1975. However, for the recent period we need to consider the time lags between the end of expeditions, the deposition of specimens in collections and the making of data accessible through databases. Currently, the average time gap between specimens being collected and identified is 21 years (Fontaine et al. 2012) .

The most complete set of this collector is deposited in the LISC herbarium, at the University of Lisbon, but many duplicate specimens were distributed to other herbaria, namely COI, BM, LISU, P, K, LUA. All herbarium acronyms are according to the Index Herbariorum (Thiers 2018) . The second most prolific collector was JM Brito Teixeira, a follower of Gossweiler who collected about 13,000 numbers in all provinces between 1949 and 1969. Several botanical expeditions were organised from Portugal, either with a focus in botany, agronomy or forestry, while others were promoted by institutions newly created in Angola. The Instituto de Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o Cient\u00edfica de Angola (IICA) was created in 1958, with herbarium and zoological collections based in Lubango. Another research institution was the Instituto de Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o Agron\u00f3mica, established in 1961, based in Huambo. Frequently, staff from institutions from both Portugal and Angola worked together in field expeditions, because, formally, the new institutions in Angola were dependencies of the equivalent Portuguese institutions. Therefore, duplicate samples were distributed to herbaria in Angola (LUBA or LUAI).",

In the twentieth century, the year 1925 presents an exceptionally high number of records of about 1400 specimens in mammal collections. This corresponds to the Arthur Vernay expedition to Angola, which specimens are in the AMNH collection. The following years with high values are 1932 and 1933, corresponding to the Phipps-Bradley Expedition, specimens also at the AMNH collection. In 1936, KH Prior sampled in Benguela, which specimens are located at the collection MVZ. In 1954 and 1955, GH Heinrich sampled in several provinces, which materials are held at FMNH. Considering the collections with the highest number of records available through GBIF, in general, the order with the highest number of specimens is Rodentia.",

A reason for this might be the incomplete status of digitisation of mammal collections in databases. This means that the values mentioned might not be representative of the total holdings of mammals from Angola. For example, the mammal collection from Lubango was not taken into account in this analysis, because the digitising process is still ongoing, in terms of data quality verification and import to a data management system. For the same reason, it is possible that in other collection types, the number of specimen records available online is also not representative of the true sampling effort for these collections. For example, in the dataset used in this chapter, no records are included from collections based in Portuguese institutions for fish or butterflies, although several zoological expeditions were organised by the Instituto de Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o Cient\u00edfica Tropical (IICT) to Angola, since 1950. This is the case of ichthyological expeditions to lakes Cameia and Dilolo, by Fernando Frade and Teixeira Pinto, in 1958. Another example of a collection that still needs to be mobilised (although already studied) is the Lepidoptera order of the Entomological collection of IICT. This collection was extensively studied in the preparation of the book Butterflies of Angola (Mendes et al. 2013) , with more than 15,000 specimens reviewed. However, the records of these specimens are not yet accessible.",

This will not, however, change the possibility of accession to collections, except for the period while the collections are being moved. The new unit in the University shares the Director with the National Museum of Natural History and Science of the University of Lisbon, but all the zoological and herbarium collections of IICT will be retained as distinct collections. This is relevant for the study of the biodiversity of Angola because these collections are important, not only because they host many type specimens, but also because some are the most representative worldwide of the biodiversity of Angola. For example, the LISC herbarium of IICT has ca. 70,000 specimens, which is the largest worldwide for Angola, because it merged duplicate specimens from several expeditions, while in Angola these were hosted in separate herbaria (LUBA, LUAI, LUA).",

The bias is reflected both in the spatial coverage of the collections, as well as in the groups' representativeness across the country (Fig. 19 .3). Some regions of Angola are clearly under-represented in collections, as is the case of the provinces of Zaire and U\u00edge, in the northwest, and most of the eastern provinces, including Lunda-Norte, Lunda-Sul, Moxico and Cuando Cubango. According to Crawford-Cabral (2010), there is a triangle that extends from Bi\u00e9 northeast to Lunda-Sul and southeast to the Cuando River, where there is a serious lack of knowledge about the fauna. This includes the interesting areas of the Upper Zambezi. The province of Hu\u00edla stands out has having almost twice the number of specimens compared with the second province, Namibe.

According to EC Afonso, curator of the Biological section in the 1980s, the Museum houses about 50,000 specimens of mammals, fishes, reptiles, amphibians and insects, the latter being the largest collection with about 30,000 specimens. Due to its value, we expect that in the future this collection can be studied and restored. The museum originally also had a herbarium (DIA), that no longer exists.",

Each specimen, as a voucher of a species found in nature, carries biological data (in its genes, tissues, traits, biochemistry) and metadata (on its label or attached field notes) providing contextual information on the location, date, habitat and ecology of that specimen. But from a set of specimens that make a collection, it is possible to do comparisons, grouping and separating them by their features, in what, ultimately, leads to the description or identification of a species. The possibility of making and analysing comparisons between specimens is fundamental to our developing the knowledge of what the species is, and therefore, our understanding of biodiversity. There is great value in having a collection. Because of this, we need to resist the fate predicted for collections in the previous quote from Saramago, that in the continuation of the text, says: \u2026 and for a short while they manage [to impose some order on the world], but only as long as they are there to defend their collection, because when the day comes when it must be dispersed, and that day always comes, either with their death or when the collector grows weary, everything goes back to its beginnings, everything returns to chaos.",

Several reports have been published about the termination of collections due to budget restrictions, either by closing doors, restricting or diverting staff to other tasks, or aggregating collections in large facilities (Gropp 2003; Deng 2015; Kemp 2015) . For example, in Italy, by 2014, it was estimated that one-third of the biological specimens were lost through lack of preservation or bad practice (Nature Editorial 2014), and in the USA 100 herbaria have been closed since 1997 (Deng 2015) . Discarding a collection brings with it the loss of investments in field expeditions, the costs of subsequent preservation of specimens across decades or centuries, and even the fact that many species may not be found anymore in the original collecting sites, due to the loss of habitats or restrictions in sampling because of conservation or ethical reasons. As an indicator, insurance companies in Norway value herbarium specimens at \u20ac21 each (Hannu Saarenmaa 2017, pers. com.). Here we will focus on the uses of collections and how they underpin scientific research, biodiversity conservation, food security, and other societal and economic benefits. Several reviews have discussed these uses, providing examples (Brooke 2000; Suarez and Tsutsui 2004; Tewksbury et al. 2014; Rocha et al. 2014) . It is worth mentioning that, with the development of laboratory methods, technology and other tools still to be invented, there are potential applications of the collections in the future that we cannot foresee.",

One of the most important roles of collections is to preserve the physical specimens that served as samples for the formal scientific description of a new species for science. These specimens, often more than one, are called types. One of these specimens is usually designated as the holotype by the author of the species -the one chosen to be most representative of the characteristics of the species -but duplicates can also be mentioned in the publication of the species, and distributed to other collections. This distribution is important for security reasons, to ensure that if the holotype is lost because of an unfortunate event, other specimens that were used the initial description of the species are preserved. In 2017, a package with specimens sent by the National Museum of Natural History in Paris to the Queensland Herbarium in Australia, including some type specimens, was incinerated by Australian customs officers (Stokstad 2017) .",

The first two initiatives are currently preparing the publication of their databases through GBIF, for global and open access to data, which is possible The sources of the data are Global Plants (http://plants.jstor.org), for plant specimens, and GBIF (GBIF.org 2018), for other collection types even though Angola is not yet a member of the organisation. Through GBIF, researchers can have access to recorded information including most of the details included in the specimen's label, and if available, an image of the specimen, a sound recording or a video attached to the specimen record. There are currently approximately 49,000 specimens from Angola with media attachments.

These include the Catalogue of Life, a global checklist for all groups, that integrates more than 168 international or group-specific checklists or taxonomic databases (Catalogue of Life 2018); the Biodiversity Heritage Library (2018) which provides digital access to legacy literature, including many publications with the original descriptions of the species, and automatic functions for searching scientific names; the Encyclopedia of Life (2018), also an integrative portal to information about species description, classification, multimedia, and distribution maps of; the Barcode of Life (Ratnasingham and Hebert 2007) which provides access to barcode sequence data; the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (2018), that promotes global and regional assessments of species conservation status; and the previously mentioned Global Plants Initiative.

Primary biodiversity data from collections is often the only data resource to document the presence of species, either because of loss of habitats due to change of land use or because of the local extinction of the species. This primary data, when combined with environmental data, can be used to model the species distribution by numerical tools that identify the environmental factors that are most closely associated with occurrence of the species. This is, in turn, converted to a species distribution model (SDM), expressed as a spatial map of probability of occurrence. Although subject to problems associated with sample bias (Beck et al. 2014; Gomes et al. 2018) , these models can be an improved approach to gap analysis (Peterson and Kluza 2003) , or help to plan sampling effort to sites with a high potential of occurrence but that has not yet been surveyed.",

A projection for a future state can be performed, using the same distribution data, but with future climate scenarios data. Using this approach, Warren et al.

To ensure that the NHCs of Angola are prepared to play this role, we propose the following roadmap for the museum and herbarium collections of Angola.",

This network of contacts should be developed to cover many biological groups and be strongly tied to cooperation activities in training, study programmes and projects focused on biodiversity.

However, natural history collections can now encompass these new methods, remaining central to the goal of understanding the world's biodiversity. We can see NHCs as vibrant facilities that merge specimen and biomolecular preservation, and biodiversity informatics infrastructure, being prepared to respond to societal challenges such as climate change, biodiversity loss and food security. Therefore, natural history can be attractive to teachers and graduate and postgraduate students in universities, provided that its activities can be properly compensated. One way of doing this is to reward data publication in career assessments of researchers and to provide proper recognition through traceable citations to the use of collections in scientific publications (Rouhan et al. 2017) .",

Obtaining a figure for the total number of specimens in collections from Angola worldwide is difficult. However, from data available through GBIF it is possible to obtain approximations. The current number of records available online through the facility is circa 150,000, which is in the same order of magnitude of other countries in southern Africa (except for South Africa, with 2,9 million and Democratic Republic of Congo, with 800,000). The situation is likely to improve in the near future, with the start of participation by Angolan institutions in GBIF (and the possible participation of the country), but the significance of these numbers will need to be translated into effective access after a fitness for use and a gap analysis of taxonomic and spatial coverage and biases of the data has been conducted.",
