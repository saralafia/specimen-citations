    "abstract": "In general form the sea otter, Enhydra lutris resembles the weasel and river otter, of which animals it is a large relative. The male attains a weight of 85 pounds, the female about 65 pounds; the young at birth weigh from 3 to 5 pounds. It is peculiar among members of its family, the Miistelidae, in having deserted dry land and fresh water to take up a marine life. Among marine mammals it is peculiar in its adaptation to the sea. It does not possess an insulating layer of blubber but is protected from the chill of North Pacific waters by a blanket of air trapped among the fine and closely packed fibres of its inchlong delicate fur. Unlike the river otter and fur seal, the sea otter has but little protective coating of guard hair. The fine guard hairs present add to its beauty but do not offer much protection to the soft under-fur. Unlike other marine mammals, the sea otter has never taken to the open sea. It usually feeds in shallow water from 5 to 50 feet in depth. Its food consist primarily of such sedentary forms as sea urchins, rock oysters, mussels, a variety of snail-like molluscs and, in California, abalones. Occasionally fish and octopus are eaten.",

For several months the pup receives most of its nourishment from its mother's two abdominal nipples, though at an early age it may also beg for and receive parts of sea urchins and molluscs that its mother is eating. She carries her pup on her chest while she herself swims on her back. On this floating platform the pup nurses, sleeps and receives almost constant preening from its mother's mobile and sensitive forepaws. The mother leaves her pup only when she dives for food and a food dive seldom lasts more than a minute. While the mother is below the surface the pup usually sleeps, buoyed up by the air enclosed in its long clean, dry fur. After each such dive the mother swims to her pup's side where she eats the food that she has carried to the surface enclosed by a fore-leg and a fold of loose skin across her chest. If her pup has drifted with the wind, she takes it on to her chest and returns it to the area in which she wishes to feed.",

Others stationed themselves at the tops of giant tripods, erected near favourite feeding or resting areas. Neither mothers nor pups were spared. A pup skin brought about $00, the skins of adults $200 to $300. So highly was the sea otter prized that by the end of the nineteenth century it had been hunted almost to extinction. The otters living off the western coasts of the United States were in fact thought to be extinct. Even yet none have been found on the coasts of Oregon or Washington, but in 1988 a group of 94 sea otters was discovered near Monterey, California.

Kirkpatrick, both of Purdue University, went to Amchitka with a Fish and Wildlife team to study the physiology of\u00bbsea otters and their response to conditions in captivity. Meanwhile Dr. Robert Rausch, parasitologist, of the Arctic Health Research Centre, conducted studies of animals found dead on the beaches during winter \" die offs \". As a result of all this work considerable knowledge was accumulated and three captive otters were finally brought to Seattle by Mr. Jones in 1954.

When first captured she leaned against the back of her cage in a half-sitting position watching our movements wide-eyed, as if in astonishment. When we brought her sea urchins and fish she placed her forepaws on her cheeks and hissed in a very cat-like way, or pushed the proffered food away with her paws. After she became accustomed to us she readily took food from our hands, never offering to bite with her strong canine teeth.
