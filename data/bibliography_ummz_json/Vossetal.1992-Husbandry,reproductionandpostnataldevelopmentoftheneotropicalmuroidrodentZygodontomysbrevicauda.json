Mainland populations of Z. brevicauda typically inhabit savannas or weedy areas around human settlements where the species is sometimes an agricultural pest. Some insular populations, however, are known to occur in rain forests. These rodents are nocturnal, omnivorous, and terrestial, seldom or never climbing trees. Nests are constructed in shallow burrows or directly on the soil surface. A related species, Z. brunneus, occurs in the inter-Andean valleys of Colombia, but other names that are sometimes combined with Zygodontomys in the literature are either synonyms of Z. brevicauda (e.g. microtinus) or refer to unrelated species properly referred to the genus Bolomys (e.g. lasiurus, lenguarum, and pixuna). The systematics and natural history of Z. brevicauda are summarized by Voss (1991) .",

The species is a hardy, prolific captive breeder and laboratory colonies have been used in studies of Neotropical arbovirus epidemiology (Bates & Weir, 1944 ; Downs et al., 1962; Jonkers et al., 1964; Tikasingh et al., 1966) . Recently, Z. brevicauda has proved to be a useful research model in other fields as well. Few tropical mammals can be bred as inexpensively in the laboratory, and the species is, therefore, a valuable resource for comparative physiological investigations. Populations of Zygodontomys brevicauda are successful in seasonally harsh environments (August, 1984; O'Connell, 1989 ), suggesting broad environmental tolerances that could be exploited in many experimental designs. At the University of Texas, Z. brevicauda has been useful in comparative studies of mammalian circannual reproductive cycles since this is one of the few tropical species known to lack a reproductive response to photoperiod (Heideman & Bronson, 1990) . The animals cope wellwith methoxyflurane (Metofane) anaesthesia and recover rapidly from surgery.",

This foundation stock was established in New York in September 1987 where an effective breeding population of between 30-40 animals has been maintained to the present. The Texas colony was established in October 1988with 32 animals from New York, members of the third and fourth captive generations. The effective breeding population in Texas has since been maintained at about 40 animals. Random mating, qualified by exclusion of full-sib pairs, is enforced in both New York and Texas; with the effective colony sizes we employ, this breeding design results in a pergeneration loss of genetic heterozygosity of only about 1% (Wright, 1969, eq 8, 5 ). Breeding success ranges from 50-90% or better among non-senescent animals. Mates cohabit amicably in about half of the random pair assignments; in such cases, males can be left with females and nursing young. Often, however, females become aggressive shortly before parturition and males must be removed to prevent injuries. Better results (reduced female aggression) can be obtained by pairing younger females with older males or by placing females in cages with bedding previously soiled by their mates. Males rarely injure females.",

In our colonies and in Aguilera's (1985) , sexual maturation of Z. brevicauda is rapid and litter sizes are moderately large by comparison with other New World muroids (e.g. Peromyscus: see Layne, 1968) . Outbreaks of infectious diseases have not been observed in our colonies and previous studies have likewise remarked on the robust health of captive-bred animals. The results of our preliminary microbiological and parasite survey suggest that captive-bred Z. brevicauda poses little significant health risk to human handlers or to other muroid species, but some precautionary remarks and recommendations for treatment of potential problems are in order.",

Fortunately, Y. pseudotuberculosis is sensitive to a wide array of antibiotics. The results of serological assays . against selected rat and mouse viruses suggests either an absence of these infectious agents in most of the animals tested or a lack of crossreactivity; future testing should employ peR technology or improved ELISA assays using Protein A as the second reagent instead of species-specific anti-immunoglobulins (Kagiyama et 01., 1989) . Species of the protozoan genus Hexamita are commonly found in the small intestines of laboratory rodents, and hexamitiasis is a potential problem for some research programmes (Hsu, 1979) . Infections are best controlled by proper sanitation and animal husbandry since treatments with amoebicides have proved ineffective (Meshorer, 1969) . Pinworms often occur in rodent colonies and are difficult to erradicate; administration of antihelminthics in the food is probably the treatment of choice for Z. brevicauda.",

This mite can transmit murine typhus (Rickettsia typhi) and plague (Yersina pestis) to man and is the intermediate host of the rodent filariid nematode Littomosoides carin;;. Infestations of O. bacoti can be eliminated by thorough cleaning of animal rooms and cages, and the use of chemical acaricides; chlorinated hydrocarbons (such as DDT, lindane, chlordane, and malathion) are effective (Flynn, 1973) . Treatment with silica dust (Tarshis, 1962) , however, may be preferred if the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes interferes with research. Recent reports that ivermectin, injected subcutaneously or added to food, is effective in eliminating prostigmatic mites from mice (Silverman et al., 1983; Wing et 01., 1985) suggest a possibly effective treatment for mesostigmatic O. bacot;. Liquid ivermectin (Eqvalan 1% liquid for horses, MSD-Avet, Division of Merck and Co., Rahway, NJ 07065, USA) could easily be administered as a tasteless additive to drinking water.",
