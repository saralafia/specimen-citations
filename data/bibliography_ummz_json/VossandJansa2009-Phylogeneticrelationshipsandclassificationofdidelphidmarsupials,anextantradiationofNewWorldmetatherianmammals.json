    "abstract": "This report summarizes a decade of morphological and molecular research on the phylogenetic relationships of didelphid marsupials (opossums), a substantially intact radiation of New World metatherian mammals. We review the comparative morphology of Recent opossums, emphasizing those anatomical systems from which taxonomically useful information is available for the majority of living genera and species, namely the integument, cranium, and dentition. Morphological similarities and differences among didelphids and other plesiomorphic marsupials (caenolestids, microbiotheriids, dasyurids, and peramelids) are also described. These observations, representing evolved differences in diverse functional-morphological systems, together with karyotypic information gleaned from the literature, provide the basis for coding 129 phylogenetic characters that we scored for 44 ingroup and seven outgroup taxa. Published information about the size, internal organization, chromosomal location, and physiological properties of five nuclear genes (BRCA1, DMP1, IRBP, RAG1, vWF) sequenced for this study suggest that these loci are unlinked, exist as single copies, are active in different tissues, and encode protein products with widely divergent functions. All of the sequenced fragments are long (.900 bp), free of ingroup alignment ambiguities, and translate to open reading frame. Nucleotide data from a total of 7320 aligned sites were obtained from 43 ingroup and seven outgroup taxa. Separate parsimony, likelihood, and Bayesian analyses of these six data partitions (morphology + karyotypes, five genes) resulted in highly congruent estimates of didelphid phylogeny with few examples of conflict among strongly supported nodes. Analyses of concatenated sequences and combined (nonmolecular + sequence) datasets effectively summarize all of the common signal recovered from separate analyses: a completely resolved ingroup phylogeny with high support statistics at most nodes. Remaining problems (not conclusively resolved in this study) include the position of the ingroup root and the relationships of three genera (Chacodelphys, Cryptonanus, Tlacuatzin) within their respective suprageneric clades. The history of didelphid classification is reviewed, and all previous systems are found to contain nonmonophyletic groups. A revised phylogenetic classification consistent with our analytic results includes the following higher taxa: Glironiinae (for Glironia), Caluromyinae (Caluromys and Caluromysiops), Hyladelphinae (Hyladelphys), Didelphinae (Marmosini, Metachirini, Didelphini, and Thylamyini), Marmosini (Marmosa, Monodelphis, and Tlacuatzin), Metachirini (Metachirus), Didelphini (Chironectes, Didelphis, Lutreolina, and Philander), and Thylamyini (Chacodelphys, Cryptonanus, Gracilinanus, Lestodelphys, Marmosops, and Thylamys). The probable relationships of several Neogene fossil genera are also discussed. To facilitate identifications, all Recent genera are redescribed, representative crania are illustrated, and a key is provided.

Both groups inhabit wet-temperate Patagonian forests, but paucituberculates also occur in climatically similar montane habitats of the tropical Andes (Bublitz, 1987; Patterson and Gallardo, 1987; Albuja and Patterson, 1996; Hershkovitz, 1999; Lunde and Pacheco, 2003) .

Although didelphids were the first metatherians to be encountered by European explorers (Eden, 1555) , the first to be described scientifically (Tyson, 1698) , and the first to be classified by taxonomists (Linnaeus, 1758) , zoological interest in opossums was soon eclipsed by the discovery of Australasian marsupials. Nevertheless, steady advances in didelphid taxonomy (mostly involving the description of new species) were made throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. Although this progress was periodically summarized by authors (e.g., Thomas, 1888; Winge, 1893; Cabrera, 1919 Cabrera, , 1958 , there is no modern monographic treatment of the family, and the current suprageneric classification (McKenna and Bell, 1997; Gardner, 2005 Gardner, , 2008 does not reflect current knowledge about opossum evolutionary relationships.",

The outgroups for this study include representatives of every extant ordinal-level clade that has ever been recovered within one or two nodes of Didelphidae in previous analyses of marsupial relationships, including caenolestids (Paucituberculata), dasyurids (Dasyuromorphia), Dromiciops (Microbiotheria), and peramelids (Peramelemorphia).

Our criteria for character choice were described at length by Voss and Jansa (2003) , so they are not repeated here. The only noteworthy methodological change in this study concerns our coding of polymorphisms. As in our previous study, we ignored rare variants (on the assumption that all characters are polymorphic given sufficiently large samples) and coded only those polymorphisms represented by nearly equal frequencies of alternative states (e.g., when presence and absence were both commonly observed for a given taxon). However, whereas we formerly (Voss and Jansa, 2003) treated such polymorphism as a separate state intermediate to the two fixed conditions, with transformations to and from the polymorphic state weighted as half-steps (the ''scaled'' option discussed by Wiens, 2000) , we here conform with the prevailing custom of coding polymorphisms as taxonomic ambiguities (e.g., as ''0/1'' for a binary character). This coding change has minimal impact on our results (only weakly supported relationships are affected, even in separate analyses of morphology) but it facilitates likelihood modeling of morphological character evolution (Lewis, 2001) in Bayesian analyses of our combined datasets (see below). MOLECULAR SEQUENCING AND HOMOLO-GY COMPARISONS: The laboratory procedures we used for DNA amplification and sequencing (including the names and locations of primers used in PCR reactions) have already been described for three of the protein-coding nuclear loci analyzed in this report: IRBP (Jansa and Voss, 2000) , Dentin Matrix Protein 1 (DMP1; Jansa et al., 2006) , and Recombination Activating 1 Gene (RAG1; Gruber et al., 2007) .

For MP analyses, all molecular characters were treated as unordered and equally weighted, and all tree searches were heuristic with at least 10 replicates of random stepwise taxon addition followed by tree bisection-reconnection (TBR) branch swapping. To choose the best models of nucleotide substitution for ML and Bayesian analyses, we examined the fit of various models separately for each of our five gene partition (IRBP, vWF, BRCA1, DMP1, and first and second codon positions of RAG1) based on neighbor-joining trees of Jukes-Cantor-corrected distances using both hierarchical likelihood-ratio tests (hLRTs) and the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) as implemented in ModelTest 3.7 (Posada and Crandall, 1998) . Where the two approaches disagreed on model choice, we used the model selected by the AIC for reasons outlined by Posada and Buckley (2004) . For both ML and Bayesian searches, the best-fit model was specified, but model parameter values were not fixed. For ML analyses, we conducted three independent runs of geneticalgorithm searches in GARLI, with random starting topologies and automatic termination after 10,000 generations with no improvement in log-likelihood scores. For Bayesian analysis of each gene partition, we conducted two independent runs of Metrop- olis-coupled Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMCMC), each with one cold and three incrementally heated chains. For each run, we assumed uniform-interval priors for all parameters, except base composition, which assumed a Dirichlet prior. Runs were allowed to proceed for 5 10 6 generations, and trees were sampled every 100 generations. We evaluated the burn-in for each run, and pooled the post-burn-in trees to calculate estimated parameter distributions and posterior probabilities for each node. We assessed nodal support from MP and ML analyses using nonparametric bootstrapping (Felsenstein, 1985) . Bootstrap values for the parsimony analyses (MPBS) were calculated in PAUP* from 1000 pseudoreplicated datasets, each of which was analyzed heuristically with 10 random-addition replicates with TBR branch swapping. Bootstrap values for the likelihood analysis (MLBS) were calculated in GARLI using genetic-algorithm searches of 1000 pseudoreplicated datasets, allowing model parameters to be estimated for each pseudoreplicate.",

Due to the large number of suboptimal trees recovered from parsimony analysis of the nonmolecular dataset, we first performed 1000 random-taxon-addition replicates with TBR branch swapping, but saved only 10 trees per replicate. We then used this pool of 10,000 trees as the starting point for an unbounded heuristic search. Parsimony analysis of the combined (molecular + nonmolecular) dataset did not exhibit this problem; therefore, we analyzed the combined dataset using unbounded heuristic searches with 1000 replicates of random-taxon addition and TBR branch swapping. For Bayesian analysis of the morphological dataset alone, we specified the Mkv model (Lewis, 2001 ) with a Cdistributed rate parameter and ascertainment bias corrected for omission of constant characters (lset coding 5 variable). For Bayesian analysis of the combined (molecular + nonmolecular) dataset, we specified this same model for the morphological data and applied the best-fit model to each of the five gene partitions. As above, we allowed parameters to be estimated independently across all partitions and used the same MCMCMC settings. To assess the impact of the large amount of missing data from Chacodelphys, we performed all analyses that included nonmolecular characters with and without this taxon.

                "text": "Most opossums are externally unremarkable mammals with pointed muzzles, large rhinaria, well-developed vibrissae, prominent eyes, membranous ears, nonspinous pelage, subequal limbs, pentadactyl feet, and naked tails. In many of these respects they resemble other plesiomorphic marsupials (e.g., Dromiciops and dasyurids) as well as certain unspecialized placentals (e.g., solenodontids, rice tenrecs, gymnures, and tree shrews). Closer inspection, however, reveals numerous distinctive and phylogenetically informative details of didelphid external morphology. SIZE: Didelphids are small to mediumsized mammals. The smallest Recent species is probably Chacodelphys formosa, the young adult holotype of which had a head-andbody length of 68 mm and probably weighed about 10 g (Voss et al., 2004a) . By contrast, the largest living opossum, Didelphis virginiana, can measure almost 500 mm in headand-body length and weigh more than 3000 g (Hamilton, 1958) . Most didelphids, however, range in head-and-body length from about 100 to 300 mm and weigh between about 20 and 500 g (table 4) . Although some authors have recognized ''large'', ''medium'', and ''small'' opossums, taxonomic assignments to discrete size categories are often arbitrary and sometimes misleading. For example, Reig et al. (1987: character 25) scored Metachirus as ''large'' and Caluromys as ''medium'' in their phylogenetic analysis, but linear measurements and weights that we compiled suggest that these taxa are indistinguishable in size. More taxonomically comprehensive compilations of morphometric data will probably document a continuum of didelphid size distributions. By comparison, Old World marsupials include some species that are smaller and others that are much larger than any didelphid. The smallest living Australian species, for example, is said to be Planigale ingrami, with an adult weight of only about 4 g, and the largest is Macropus rufus, males of which are said to weigh as much as 85 kg (Dawson et al., 1989) . The extinct Pleistocene species Diprotodon optatum, however, may have weighed almost 2800 kg (Wroe et al., 2004) .",

The part of the rhinarium that borders the upper lip (pars supralabialis) is broad, and its ventral margin is notched by one or two distinct grooves on each side of the median sulcus ( fig. 1 ). Two ventrolateral grooves are present on each side in most examined taxa, but only a single groove is present in Chironectes, Didelphis, Lestodelphys, Lutreolina, Metachirus, Monodelphis, Philander, and Thylamys pallidior. Dasyurids and Dromiciops have rhinaria that are essentially similar in gross morphology to those of didelphids, with a pars supralabialis that makes broad contact with the upper lip; however, only a single ventrolateral groove is present in these taxa (Pocock, 1926: figs. 26-28) . By contrast, the supralabial part of the rhinarium is reduced to a narrow philtrum in caenolestids and peramelids, such that the groove-bearing ventral rhinarial margin of other marsupials is effectively absent. The mouth is large in all didelphids, with a posterior angle (angulis oris; Brown, 1971) that extends posteriorly to a point below the eye; the upper and lower oral margins are smooth or irregularly wrinkled and anatomically featureless. Most other marsupials have anatomically featureless oral margins like those of didelphids, but caenolestids are uniquely provided with reciprocating fleshy lappets of unknown function on the upper and lower lips (Osgood, 1921: pl. 2; Bublitz, 1987: fig. 4 ; Patterson and Gallardo, 1987: fig. 3 ).",

Both species have a broad pars supralabialis (psl) that contacts the upper lip. Only a single groove (g) is present along the ventral margin of the pars supralabialis on each side of the median sulcus (ms) in T. pallidior, whereas two ventrolateral grooves are present in M. robinsoni. Scale bars 5 2 mm. gular (throat) gland, the presence of which is indicated on dried skins and fluid-preserved specimens by a bare median patch of skin; often, but not invariably, the surrounding fur is discolored. According to Barnes (1977: 390) , this secretory region contains ''hypertrophied apocrine sudoriferous glands and sebaceous glands, both confined to the thickened dermis.''

Lyne (1959) reported the occurrence of postcranial vibrissae in several didelphid species based on his examination of pouch young, whose sensory hair follicles are easily seen because they are not obscured by coat hairs. Unfortunately, postcranial vibrissae are much harder to observe on fully furred adult specimens, the only material commonly available for most species. We found ulnarcarpal and medial antebrachial vibrissae on most examined didelphids, whereas anconeal and calcaneal vibrissae were often inapparent. All didelphids have soft (nonspinous) fur consisting of two or more distinct types of hairs whose density and morphology determine the appearance and texture of the coat. Some taxa (e.g., Caluromys) have somewhat woolly fur that does not lie flat or exhibit the glossy highlights typically seen in the pelts of many other taxa, but textural differences are hard to define by objective criteria that can be used for character-state definitions or taxonomic diagnoses. The only structural (nonpigmental) feature of didelphid body pelage that seems useful in this context is the presence of uniquely long, coarse guard hairs that project conspicuously from the underfur in species of Didelphis.",

Grossly enlarged glabrous tubercles supported internally by carpal ossifications are exhibited by large adult males of Cryptonanus, Gracilinanus, Marmosops, Tlacuatzin, and some species of Marmosa. Two distinct kinds of tubercles can be distinguished, consisting of lateral (''ulnar'') tubercles supported internally by the pisiform, and medial (''radial'') tubercles supported by the prepollex (op. cit.). Although some intraspecific variation in the development of carpal tubercles has been documented, most of it can be attributed to ontogeny: tubercles are consistently present in the largest adult male specimens of species in which such structures occur, whereas they may be lacking in some smaller (presumably younger) conspecific males. Lunde and Schutt (1999) plausibly suggest that these structures function as clasping devices during copulation. Lateral carpal tubercles ( fig. 2 ) are more widespread than medial carpal tubercles, occurring in all taxa that exhibit any externally obvious sexual dimorphism in the wrist. We found these structures to be consistently present in large adult male specimens of Cryptonanus, Gracilinanus, Marmosops, Tlacuatzin, and most species of Marmosa. In addition, we observed medial carpal tubercles (Lunde and Schutt, 1999: fig. 3 ) in Marmosa demerarae, M. mexicana, M. paraguayana, M. regina, M. robinsoni, and M. rubra. Other didelphids appear to lack sexually dimorphic carpal tubercles, 2 but we were not able to determine whether or not such structures are present in Chacodelphys and Glironia because no fully adult male specimens of either genus are currently available for study.",

In most didelphids, the manual digits are more or less evenly spaced, but in some arboreal taxa (e.g., Caluromys, Caluromysiops, Marmosa) the gap between dII and dIII is somewhat larger than the gaps separating other pairs of adjacent fingers, and it is possible that these taxa are incipiently schizodactylous (sensu Haines, 1958) . The pollex (dI) of Chironectes is set off from the other manual digits by a wide gap and appears to be pseudo-opposable (sensu Napier, 1961) ; in fluid-preserved specimens it is often folded across the palm (Augustiny, 1942: fig. 16 ).",

These six pads encircle a central palmar region that is either smooth or sparsely tubercular (as in most didelphids; see Hershkovitz, 1997: fig. 6A ) or densely covered with small convex tubercles (as in Chacodelphys, Lestodelphys, and most species of Thylamys; see Carmignotto and Monfort, 2006: fig. 3C ). In almost all species, the epidermis that covers the plantar pads is sharply differentiated from that of the surrounding plantar surface because it is provided with dermatoglyphs (friction or papillary ridges; Hamrick, 2001 ) resembling those on human fingertips. Plantar pads tend to be larger and to have more pronounced dermatoglyphs in arboreal opossums (e.g., Caluromys) than in terrestrial forms (e.g., Monodelphis) , but a few didelphids exhibit qualitatively different morphologies. Monodelphis and Marmosops both have mesaxonic forefeet in which the third digit (dIII) is longest, whereas Marmosa has a paraxonic forefoot in which dIII and dIV are subequal. In Caluromys, dIV is the longest manual digit.",

However, whereas dIII and dIV are subequal in Dromiciops, dIII is distinctly longer than dIV in dasyurids. By contrast, dI and dV are conspicuously reduced and nail bearing in caenolestids (Osgood, 1921: pl. 2, fig. 4 ), and the same digits are vestigial-lacking claws or nails-in peramelemorphians (Lyne, 1951: fig. 11 ); of the remaining manual digits, dIII is distinctly the longest in both of these groups. Manual plantar pads are indistinct or absent in all examined peramelemorphians but they are distinct in dasyurids, caenolestids, and Dromiciops. Whereas the plantar pads of Dromiciops and at least some dasyurids (e.g., Murexia) have dermatoglyphs, the plantar pads of other dasyurids (e.g., Sminthopsis crassicaudata) are tubercular, and those of caenolestids are smooth. The central palmar surface is essentially smooth (or irregularly creased) in caenolestids and Dromiciops, but it is densely tubercular in examined dasyurids and peramelids. PES: Most didelphids have an eleuthrodactylous hind foot with five well-developed digits that are all separate and freely movable ( fig. 4 ). The only exception is Chironectes, whose pedal digits are bound together by webs of skin to form a paddlelike swimming organ (illustrated by Augustiny, 1942: Mondolfi and Medina, 1957; Oliver, 1976; Hershkovitz, 1997) . Although Bensley (1903) , Tate (1933) , and Kirsch (1977b) suggested that some didelphids exhibit incipient fusion of dII and dIII, we have not observed any specimen with a hind foot that even remotely resembles the syndactylous condition seen in peramelemorphians and diprotodontians. 3",

By contrast, dII, dIII, and dIV are subequal (none distinctly longer than the others) in Didelphis albiventris and D. virginiana. Among all other examined didelphid taxa (including Didelphis marsupialis), the second, third, and fourth pedal digits progressively increase in length, such that dIV is the longest toe opposing the hallux. It is noteworthy that the relative lengths of pedal digits do not strictly covary with those of the manual digits, as they might be expected to do if transformations of the pes and manus were functionally or developmentally determined by the same factors. For example, whereas dIV is the longest pedal digit in Marmosops, dIII is the longest manual digit in that genus.",

(2) The hypothenar is absent or variably present but clearly vestigial in Monodelphis, Lutreolina, Philander, and Didelphis. (3) The thenar (medial tarsal) and first interdigital pads are often in contact or indistinguishably fused among arboreal taxa (e.g., Caluromys and Marmosa) , but a continuum of intermediate conditions precludes any unambiguous distinction between these morphologies and the separate conditions seen in terrestrial forms (e.g., Monodelphis and Thylamys).

Although our sample sizes were always small, we observed no intraspecific variation in this aspect of female reproductive morphology, nor did we observe any intermediate condition between absence and presence of a pouch. Despite the fact that several distinctly different pouch configurations can be recognized among opossums, we provisionally recognize all pouches as homologous in the absence of a priori evidence to the contrary. We found no trace of a pouch in suitable material (fluid-preserved specimens and carefully prepared skins) of parous adult female Cryptonanus, Glironia, Gracilinanus, Hyladelphys, Lestodelphys, Marmosa, Marmosops, Metachirus, Monodelphis, Thylamys, and Tlacuatzin. By contrast, well-developed pouches were consistently found to be present in suitably prepared parous adult females of Caluromys, Chironectes, Didelphis, and Philander. Although Lutreolina was described as pouchless by Thomas (1888) , Cabrera (1919) , and Marshall (1978a) , two fluid-preserved parous females that we examined (UMMZ 166634, USNM 536827) had pouches exactly resembling the morphology illustrated and described by Krieg (1924: fig. 11 ). Caluromysiops is said to have a pouch (Izor and Pine, 1987; Reig et al., 1987) , but no explicit description or illustration of the female reproductive anatomy of this genus is available, nor were we able to examine suitably preserved parous female specimens. The presence or absence of a pouch remains undocumented for many opossums, notably Chacodelphys. Contradictory literature accounts of a pouch as present or absent in Metachirus were discussed by Voss and Jansa (2003) .",

The only exceptions that we have encountered are Caluromys lanatus, Glironia venusta, 4 and Hyladelphys kalinowskii ( fig. 5A ), examined females of which have four mammae in two abdominal-inguinal pairs with no trace of a median teat. By convention, didelphid mammary complements are summarized by formulae representing the rightside (R), median (M), left-side (L), and total (T) teat counts in the format R-M-L 5 T. Thus, the mammary complement of the illustrated specimen of Marmosops parvidens could be written as 4-1-4 5 9, whereas that of Hyladelphys kalinowskii would be 2-0-2 5 4. Occasionally, lateral teats are unpaired, resulting in even-numbered totals for taxa that possess an unpaired median teat, but such anomalies are easily distinguished by formulae (e.g., 3-1-4 5 8 if the anteriormost right teat of AMNH 267344 were really missing in fig. 5B ).",

Only two pairs of inguinal-abdominal teats are present in H. kalinowskii, which is unusual among didelphids in lacking an unpaired median teat; its mammary formula is 2-0-2 5 4. By contrast, the illustrated specimen of M. parvidens has four pairs of inguinal-abdominal teats plus an unpaired median teat (4-1-4 5 9). and share a continuous mucosa. In life, both openings are normally recessed in a common sinus (cloaca), but this feature is obscured in male specimens with everted genitalia. Chironectes uniquely lacks a cloaca because the urogenital and rectal openings are widely separated by furred inguinal skin (Nogueira et al., 2004: fig. 1 ). Conflicting descriptions of didelphid cloacal morphology by Hershkovitz (1992a Hershkovitz ( , 1992b were discussed and refuted by Voss and Jansa (2003) .

The known range of relative tail length in the family is bracketed on the one hand by Gracilinanus emiliae, an arboreal species with a tail that may be almost twice as long as the combined length of its head and body (Voss et al., 2005: table 2) , and on the other by some terrestrial forms (e.g., Monodelphis spp.) with a tail that may be less than half as long as the head and body. However, arboreal taxa are not always longer tailed than terrestrial forms. Treedwelling Glironia venusta, for example, has a tail that is subequal in length to its head and body, whereas ground-dwelling Metachirus nudicaudatus is much longer tailed. Body pelage (soft fur composed of ordinary coat hairs that are not associated with epidermal scales) extends to a variable extent onto didelphid tails. Body fur extends onto the tail much farther dorsally than ventrally in Glironia (see da Silva and Langguth, 1989: fig. 1 ), Caluromysiops, and some species of Caluromys and Monodelphis (see Voss et al., 2001 : fig. 29A ). By contrast, body fur extends onto the tail dorsally and ventrally to about the same extent (from about one-sixth to about one-third the length of that organ) in Caluromys philander, Chironectes, Didelphis, Lutreolina, Philander, and some species of Marmosa (e.g., M. paraguayana) . In most other didelphids, however, body fur does not extend more than a short distance, if at all, onto the tail base.",

In most taxa with pale tail tips, the basal color is grayish or brownish and the transition is either gradual (the basal color fading to whitish distally; e.g., in Marmosops ocellatus) or irregularly mottled (e.g., as in Caluromys derbianus; frontispiece). However, in most specimens of Chironectes (frontispiece), Didelphis, Lutreolina, and Philander, the tail is blackish basally with an abruptly white tip. Dorsoventrally bicolored tails (which are grayish or brownish above and pale on the underside) represent another widespread pattern of didelphid caudal marking that is indistinct in some species but sharply defined in others. Different patterns of caudal markings often distinguish closely related species and can be used in combination with other external traits to identify congeneric taxa in the field (Voss et al., 2004b: table 4) . The epidermal scales that cover the unfurred nonprehensile surfaces of didelphid tails differ taxonomically in shape and arrangement (Tate, 1933: fig. 2 ). Square or rectangular caudal scales in unambiguously annular series occur in Chacodelphys, Cryptonanus, Thylamys, Tlacuatzin, and most species of Gracilinanus. Although individual cutaneous scales are indistinct in Lestodelphys and Monodelphis, the annular arrangement of caudal bristles in both taxa suggest that they also conform to the Thylamys pattern. By contrast, rhomboidal (diamondshaped) or hexagonal scales in spiral series occur in Caluromys, Caluromysiops, Chironectes, Didelphis, Lutreolina, Marmosops, Philander, and most species of Marmosa. A few taxa, however, have caudal scales that appear to be morphologically intermediate between the annular and spiral morphotypes. In these taxa (e.g., Hyladelphys, Metachirus, Marmosa mexicana) the caudal scales are arrayed in annular series over the vertebral articulations and in more or less spiral series elsewhere. Glironia cannot be assigned to any of these caudal-scale patterns because the dorsal and lateral surfaces of its tail are covered by body fur and the entire ventral surface is modified for prehension (da Silva and Langguth, 1989: fig. 1 ).",

Although individual cutaneous scales are hard to distinguish in Monodelphis, the caudal hairs of species that we examined usually emerge from the skin in triplets, so this genus appears to conform to the widespread didelphid condition. The number of hairs normally associated with each caudal scale is impossible to assess in Glironia (whose dorsal caudal surface is furry and whose ventral caudal surface is modified for prehension; see above and below) and Lestodelphys (on which no discrete clustering within rows of caudal hairs could be distinguished with confidence). The hairs that emerge from the posterior margin of each caudal scale are not grossly differentiated, varying in length but subequal in thickness, in most didelphids. However, in most species of Marmosops the middle hair of each caudal-scale triplet is conspicuously thicker than the lateral hairs, and it is often more darkly pigmented (Gardner and Creighton, 1989) .",

In taxa conforming to this morphology, the tail tip is sometimes provided with a smooth terminal button but never with a ventrally expanded apical pad bearing dermatoglyphs. The tails of all other didelphids are provided with a distal prehensile surface that may be smooth or covered by modified scales (conspicuously unlike those of the caudal dorsum) but is always transversely creased and glabrous; in taxa conforming to this morphology, the tail tip is invariably provided with a ventrally expanded pad bearing dermatoglyphs (for illustrations of Didelphis and Philander, see Hershkovitz, 1997: fig. 7 ). Some taxa additionally exhibit caudal modifications for basal prehension. Whereas the unfurred ventral surface of the tail base in most didelphids is covered by smooth flat scales, each of which is soft and flexible (yielding easily to the tip of a probe on fluidpreserved material), the scales on the underside of the base of the tail are heavily cornified, forming hard raised tubercles in Glironia (see da Silva and Langguth, 1989: fig 1a) , Caluromysiops, and some species of Caluromys.",

Additionally, the literature contains no comprehensive account of the cranial features by which didelphids as a group differ from other marsupials, although important comparative observations were made by Osgood (1921) , Tate (1947 Tate ( , 1948b , Archer (1976a) , Reig et al. (1987) , Marshall et al. (1995) , Wroe (1997) , Muizon (1998) , and S\u00e1 nchez-Villagra and Wible (2002) , among others. Following a brief consideration of overall cranial shape, the following accounts summarize relevant cranial comparisons in a roughly anterior to posterior sequence along the dorsolateral contours of the skull, starting with the rostrum and nasal cavity and proceeding to the orbital region and braincase. A second sequence describes ventral cranial features beginning with the palate and proceeding to the basicranium and occiput. The principal osteological features of the didelphid skull and mandible are illustrated in figures 6 and 7. SHAPE VARIATION: Didelphids exhibit conspicuous variation in overall cranial shape that is illustrated in the taxonomic accounts below (figs. 37-54). Although some shape variation is obviously allometric (larger opossums tending to have relatively larger rostra and temporal fossae but relatively smaller orbits and braincases than smaller opossums), size-independent shape contrasts are also obvious. Thus, the rostrum is relatively short and broad in both Hyladelphys and Lutreolina, whereas the rostrum is relatively long and narrow in Marmosops and Metachirus. 5 A continuous taxonomic series of intermediate proportions makes any qual- 5 We quantified rostral proportions in exemplar skulls from taxa that were visually judged to represent morphological extremes in this respect. We measured rostral length (RL) from the anterior margin of one orbit to the tip of the ipsilateral nasal bone, and we measured skull size as condylobasal length (CBL) . The values we obtained for the index (RL 4 CBL) 3 100 ranged from about 30% (in Lutreolina) to about 45% (in Metachirus).",

However, some turbinal structures are accessible to direct inspection. The maxilloturbinals, for example, are thin, dorsally scrolling sheets of bone that occupy the lower part of the didelphid nasal fossa, where they arise from the inner surface of the maxilla on each side. In most didelphids, the greater curvature of each maxilloturbinal scroll throws off secondary lamellae, which branch to form tertiary lamellae, some of which branch again to form an elaborate dendritic mass that fills much of the ventrolateral part of the nasal lumen. By contrast, the maxilloturbinals are simple, slender, unbranched (or sparsely ornamented) scrolls in all examined species of Monodelphis. The morphology of the nasal cavity remains to be surveyed among other marsu- pials. However, some peramelemorphians (e.g., Echymipera, Perameles) appear to have simple (unbranched) maxilloturbinals, whereas the maxilloturbinals of examined dasyurids (e.g., Murexia, Sminthopsis) and Dromiciops closely resemble the elaborately dendritic condition seen in most didelphids. A monographic study of marsupial endonasal features based on high-resolution X-ray computed tomography (Macrini and Voss, in preparation) will doubtless provide additional points of comparison among didelphids and other marsupial clades.",

The lacrimal is perforated by one or more lacrimal foramina that are sometimes concealed within the orbit ( fig. 9A ) but usually open laterally on or near the orbital margin ( fig. 9B ). Most didelphids normally have two lacrimal foramina on each side, but Chironectes, Hyladelphys, and some populations of Didelphis virginiana usually have just one lacrimal foramen, and many other didelphids that normally have two lacrimal foramina occasionally have a single foramen on one or both sides of the skull. The orbital margin formed by the lacrimal is smoothly rounded in all didelphids, none of which exhibits lacrimal tubercles (e.g., like those seen in macropodids; Wells and Tedford, 1995: fig. 9 ) or distinct crests (as in Myrmecobius and some peramelemorphians). Unlike the condition seen in some Old World marsupials with maxillary-frontal contact on the medial wall of the orbit (Flannery et al., 1987 : fig. 3 ), the didelphid lacrimal is always in posteroventral contact with the palatine. 6 The medial wall of the didelphid orbit is perforated by several openings, including the sphenopalatine foramen (always in the palatine bone), the ethmoid foramen (in the suture between the orbitosphenoid and frontal), the sphenorbital fissure (between the palatine, orbitosphenoid, alisphenoid, presphenoid, and sometimes the pterygoid), and the foramen rotundum (in the alisphenoid). The configuration of these orbital perforations in all examined taxa is essentially similar to that illustrated for Monodelphis by Wible (2003: fig. 4 ). In particular, the foramen rotundum is always exposed to lateral view behind the sphenorbital fissure, from which it is invariably separated by a bony partition. 7 Many 6 Note that elements of the didelphid orbital mosaic are incorrectly labeled in some published illustrations (e.g., Hershkovitz, 1992b Hershkovitz, [fig. 19], 1997 , where the orbital process of the palatine that contacts the lacrimal is misidentified as the ''sphenoid. '' 7 According to Novacek (1986 Novacek ( , 1993 , the foramen rotundum is confluent with the sphenorbital fissure in didelphids, but these foramina are unambiguously separate openings in all of the material examined by us and by Wible (2003) .",

The frontals produce distinct postorbital processes in several genera, most of which are rather large opossums (e.g., Caluromys, Philander) , but some of which are small (e.g., Tlacuatzin). In Calur-omys, Caluromysiops, Glironia, Tlacuatzin, and most species of Marmosa ( fig. 11A ) the postorbital processes are flattened and more or less triangular, but the postorbital processes of Chironectes, Didelphis, Lutreolina, and Philander are often bluntly pyramidal or hornlike projections. Because frontal outgrowths tend to develop late in postweaning ontogeny , postorbital processes are often absent in juvenile and subadult specimens of taxa that normally exhibit them when fully grown. The postorbital processes of Glironia uniquely consist of both frontal and parietal moieties ( fig. 37 ). Among didelphids that normally lack distinct postorbital processes (Chacodelphys, Cryptonanus, Gracilinanus, Lestodelphys, Marmosops, Metachirus, Monodelphis, Thylamys) , the supraorbital margins of the frontals may be beaded (with a dorsally upturned edge) or more or less smooth and featureless. Taxa with supraorbital beads include some species of Gracilinanus (e.g., G. emiliae), Hyladelphys, some species of Marmosops (e.g., M. noctivagus; fig. 11B ), Marmosa rubra, and Metachirus. By contrast, Fig. 9 . Detail of the anterior orbital region in Marmosops parvidens (A, AMNH 267359) and M. pinheiroi (B, AMNH 267345). In M. parvidens the lacrimal foramina (lf) are concealed from lateral view inside the orbit, whereas the lacimal foramina are laterally exposed anterior to the orbit in M. pinheiroi. Other abbreviations: fro, frontal; jug, jugal; lac, lacrimal; max, maxillary; nas, nasal; pal, palatine. the supraorbital margins are consistently smooth and essentially featureless in most specimens of Cryptonanus, Lestodelphys, Thylamys, and other species of Marmosops and Gracilinanus (e.g., G. agilis; fig. 11C ).",

The scars that mark the dorsalmost origin of the temporalis muscle on each side of the braincase are widely separated, and no sagittal crest is developed in most didelphids. In large adult specimens of Caluromys, Lestodelphys, and Monodelphis, however, a small sagittal crest is sometimes developed over the interparietal or along the midparietal suture. By contrast, much larger sagittal crests that extend anteriorly onto the frontals-an unambiguously different condition-are consistently developed in adult specimens of Caluromysiops, Chironectes, Didelphis, Lutreolina, and Philander. Sagittal crests are altogether absent in caenolestids, In Thylamys (and most other didelphids), the maxillary (max) and alisphenoid (als) bones are separated by the palatine (pal), but the alisphenoid extends anteriorly across the palatine to contact the maxillary in Monodelphis.

In fact, parietal-alisphenoid contact is exhibited by all didelphids with the unique exception of Metachirus ( fig. 44 ). Among other marsupials, parietal-alisphenoid contact is also found in caenolestids (Osgood, 1921: pl. 20, fig. 2), most dasyuromorphians (e.g., Dasycercus; Jones, 1949: fig. 8 ), some fossil peramelemorphians (e.g., Yarala; Muirhead, 2000) , and many diprotodontians, whereas squamosal-frontal contact is present in some dasyuromorphians (e.g., Sminthopsis; Archer, 1981: fig. 4 ), all Recent peramelemorphians, and a few diprotodontians (Wroe et al., 1998) . Dromiciops, the only microbiotherian for which the lateral braincase morphology is known, also exhibits squamosal-frontal contact. 8 In most didelphids (Chironectes, Didelphis, Glironia, Lutreolina, Marmosa, Metachirus, Monodelphis, Philander, and Tlacuatzin) the petrosal is only exposed on the occiput (behind the lambdoid crest) and on the ventral surface of the skull (between the exoccipital, basioccipital, and alisphenoid; see Wible, 1990: fig. 1 ). In taxa conforming to this morphology, there are no gaps among the bones that normally form the lateral surface of the braincase (squamosal, parietal, and interparietal; fig. 12A ). By contrast, the petrosal capsule that encloses the paraflocculus and the semicircular canals (5 pars mastoideus or pars canalicularis) is consistently exposed through a fenestra in the suture between the parietal and squamosal in Chacodelphys, Cryptonanus, Gracilinanus, Thylamys, and some species of Marmosops ( fig. 12B ). Both conditions-presence and absence of a fenestra in the squamosal- parietal suture-occur as balanced polymorphisms (neither state clearly predominating) in Lestodelphys, Marmosops incanus, and M. noctivagus. No nondidelphid marsupial that we examined has a fenestrated squamosalparietal suture.",

In these taxa, the sutures that separate the interparietal from adjacent bones (supraoccipital and parietals) are clearly visible and ontogenetically persistent. In all of the taxa we examined with such distinctly sutured interparietals, the interparietal-supraoccipital boundary coincides closely with the transverse (lambdoid) crest that marks the dorsalmost insertion of the neck extensor musculature. An interparietal is also unambiguously present in didelphids, all of which exhibit a large, unpaired, wedge-shaped or oblong element between the left and right parietals in the same position (anterior to the lamb-doid crest) as the sutured interparietals of other marsupials. The didelphid interparietal, however, is fused with the supraoccipital in all of the skulls we examined (including postweaning juveniles assignable to Gardner's [1973] age class 1), few of which show any trace of a suture. 9 Fortunately, developmental studies of didelphid pouch young are available to prove the existence of a distinct interparietal center of ossification. In Didelphis the interparietal first appears around day 8 postpartum (p) and fuses with the supraorbital by day 28p (Nesslinger, 1956) , whereas in Monodelphis these events occur on days 3p and 8p, respectively (Clark and Smith, 1993) . By contrast, the didelphid interparietal never appears to fuse with the parietals, the sutures between them persisting even in the largest adult specimens we examined. , illustrating the presence of a fenestra (fen) that exposes the petrosal (pet) between the parietal (par) and squamosal (sq) in Marmosops.

In young dasyurids, for example, the interparietal is small and separated by open sutures from neighboring bones, or it is absent; no examined dasyurid has a large median element fused to the supraoccipital that is suturally distinct from the parietals and wedged between their posterior borders. The interparietal appears to be completely missing in peramelemorphians, none of which show any trace of a bony element wedged between the parietals anterior to the Metachirus nudicaudatus (C, D, AMNH 267009) illustrating taxonomic differences in several cranial characters discussed in the text, including alternative patterns of contact among the interparietal (ip), squamosal (sq), parietal (par), and mastoid (5 pars mastoideus of petrosal, mas). Additionally, the incisura occipitalis (io), a distinct notch in the dorsal margin of the foramen magnum (fm), separates the right and left exoccipitals in Lestodelphys. By contrast, the incisura occipitalis is absent because medial processes of the right and left exoccipitals are in contact, excluding the supraoccipital from the dorsal margin of the foramen magnum in Metachirus. Another conspicuous taxonomic difference illustrated in these views concerns the paroccipital process (pp), which is a small, inconspicuous bony mass adnate to the mastoid in Lestodelphys. The paroccipital process of Metachirus is much larger and projects almost straight ventrally. lambdoid crest, even as juveniles. The condition in caenolestids is uninterpretable because no sutures persist on the posterodorsal braincase of any examined specimen.",

                "text": "The didelphid interparietal participates in two alternative patterns of contact among bones of the posterior braincase and the occiput. In most opossums the interparietal does not contact the squamosal because the parietal is in contact with the mastoid (fig. 13A, B ). However, in Chironectes, Didelphis, Lutreolina, Philander, and in one examined specimen of Metachirus ( fig. 13C , D) the interparietal contacts the squamosal and prevents the parietal from contacting the mastoid. Two species of Monodelphis (M. brevicaudata and M. emiliae) exhibit both conditions with approximately equal frequency among the specimens we examined. Most examined nondidelphid marsupials exhibit parietal-mastoid contact, but acrobatids and Tarsipes exhibit broad interparietalsquamosal contact (Parker, 1890: fig. 2), and phalangerids uniquely exhibit squamosalexoccipital contact (Flannery et al., 1987: fig. 4C, D) . PALATE: The bony palate is variously perforated by foramina and fenestrae that exhibit considerable variation in occurrence, size, and position among marsupials. Unfortunately, inconsistent terminology has long inhibited clear communication about taxonomic differences. The nomenclature for palatal perforations adopted herein is illustrated in figure 14 and compared with other terminology in table 6. The incisive foramina are prominent slots in the anterior palate that transmit the nasopalatine ducts (S\u00e1 nchez-Villagra, 2001a) together with nerves and blood vessels that remain to be identified in marsupials (Wible, 2003) . In didelphids, these openings extend from the upper incisor arcade posteriorly to or between the canines. Although didelphid incisive foramina are always bordered posteriorly and posterolaterally by the maxillary bones, their dividing septum is formed primarily by the premaxillae. By contrast, the enormously elongated incisive foramina of caenolestids extend posteriorly between the premolar rows (opposite P1 or P2), and the posterior part of the dividing septum is formed by the maxillae (Osgood, 1921: pl. 20) . The long incisive foramina of peramelemorphians do not extend behind C1, but the posterior part of their dividing septum is likewise formed by the maxillae. Most other marsupials (e.g., dasyuromorphians and Dromiciops) have incisive foramina that essentially resemble those of didelphids, with the conspicuous exception of some diprotodontians (e.g., Macropus; Wells and Tedford, 1995: fig. 9E ) in which these openings are completely contained by the premaxillae.",

Although small perforations in the maxillary-palatine sutures occur in most examined specimens of both genera, these are obviously vascular openings (perhaps homologous with the major palatine foramina of placental mammals) that do not resemble the nonvascular fenestrae of other didelphids. Glironia is sometimes said to lack palatal fenestrae (e.g., by Archer, 1982; Reig Fig. 14.

When present, the left and right maxillopalatine fenestrae of didelphids are invariably separated by a broad median septum, and they never extend posteriorly behind the molar rows. Maxillopalatine fenestrae are very widely distributed among other marsupials, but they are absent in a few taxa (e.g., Myrmecobius, Dactylopsila, Phascolarctos). Among nondidelphid marsupials that possess these openings, the right and left fenestrae are often confluent because no median septum is developed (as in Rhyncholestes and Perameles gunnii), or they may extend posteriorly well behind the molar rows (as in acrobatids and some burramyids).",

In didelphids, caenolestids, Dromiciops, peramelemorphians, and stem metatherians, this foramen is completely surrounded by bone, but the foramen is incomplete or absent in many dasyurids (e.g., Murexia and Sminthopsis) because the maxillary and palatine processes that form the posterior border of this opening in other taxa fail to ossify (Wroe, 1997) . In most didelphids the posterolateral palatal foramina are small and located behind the fourth upper molar, but these openings are conspicuously larger and extend lingual to the protocone of M4 on each side of the skull in Thylamys ( fig. 54 ) and most specimens of Lestodelphys (fig. 51 ).",

In other marsupials, the vomer may also extend between the left and right pterygoids, but in Dromiciops the pterygoids are in midline contact, underlying the presphenoid and concealing its suture with the basisphenoid from ventral view; the conjoined pterygoids of Dromiciops form a strong sagittal keel, which is continuous with that formed anteriorly by the vomer and posteriorly by the basisphenoid. 10 BASICRANIAL FORAMINA: A foramen that transmits the venous transverse canal perforates the alisphenoid anterolateral to the carotid canal in most didelphids (S\u00e1 nchez-Villagra, 2001b; S\u00e1 nchez-Villagra and Wible, 2002) . Caluromys and Caluromysiops, however, consistently lack a transverse canal foramen (Archer, 1976a ; S\u00e1 nchez-Villagra and Wible, 2002; Voss and Jansa, 2003) . According to Kirsch and Archer (1982: character 24) , the ''transverse canal'' is absent in Metachirus nudicaudatus and Philander opossum, but most of the specimens we examined of both taxa had a transverse canal foramen on each side of the skull. The transverse canal foramen is normally present in most other marsupials (e.g., caenolestids, dasyurids, peramelemorphians, and Dromiciops), although its reduction or absence in a few taxa (e.g., Planigale, Tarsipes) has been noted by authors (Archer, 1976a; Aplin, 1990 ; S\u00e1 nchez-Villagra and Wible, 2002) .",

(1996) , we use the term ''foramen ovale'' for the primary orifice through which V 3 exits the endocranial lumen of the adult skull. In most didelphids, the foramen ovale is bordered by the alisphenoid and the petrosal ( fig. 16A ), but the foramen is sometimes contained entirely within the alisphenoid, and both conditions can be seen on opposite sides of the same skull (Gaudin et al., 1996: fig. 6 ). Because it is often difficult to determine the position of this opening with respect to relevant endocranial sutures, however, we did not score the position of the foramen ovale per se. Instead, secondary enclosures of V 3 by outgrowths of the alisphenoid tympanic process provide a more accessible basis for taxonomic comparisons. Two different (apparently nonhomologous) conditions of secondary nerve enclosure occur among didelphids.",

In other opossums, a distinct gap separates the alisphenoid tympanic process from the rostral tympanic process of the petrosal, such that at least part of the floor of the middle ear is membranous (e.g., in Marmosa and Monodelphis; Reig et al., 1987: fig. 41B, D) . In Lestodelphys and Thylamys a rather indistinct medial process of the ectotympanic makes a small contribution to the floor of the middle ear, partially filling in the gap between the tympanic processes of the alisphenoid and petrosal (Reig et al., 1987: fig. 42B, D) . The roof of the hypotympanic sinus in all Recent didelphids is almost exclusively formed by the alisphenoid, with the petrosal making only a small, often negligible, contribution.

Caenolestids and Dromiciops are similar to didelphids in this respect, but Recent dasyuromorphians and some peramelemorphians (e.g., Macrotis and Perameles) have a welldeveloped epitympanic sinus formed by the squamosal. This structure is a cup-shaped cavity that, in all skulls retaining vestiges of auditory soft tissues, appears to be covered by the membrana Shrapnelli (pars flaccida of the tympanic membrane). Archer (1976a: 304) remarked that, ''[i]n some didelphids (e.g., Metachirus) there is a depression in the squamosal which is clearly the homologue of this sinus,'' but nothing resembling the squamosal epitympanic sinus of dasyurids occurs in any living opossum. ECTOTYMPANIC AND OSSICLES: Although didelphids were described by van der Klaauw (1931: 26) as having a completely free ectotympanic, two distinct patterns of ectotympanic attachment can be recognized in the family. In most didelphids the anterior limb (or crus) of the ectotympanic annulus is directly connected to the skull near the point where the squamosal, alisphenoid, and petrosal are juxtaposed behind the postglenoid process. Where the connection can be seen clearly (dried remnants of soft tissues frequently obscure this feature), the actual attachment seems to be to the petrosal (fig .  17A ). In six genera (Caluromys, Caluromysiops, Chironectes, Didelphis, Lutreolina, and Philander), however, the anterior limb of the ectotympanic is not directly attached to the skull, and the suspension is indirect, via the anterior (tympanic) process of the malleus ( fig. 17B ). In all didelphids with an indirect dorsal connection between the ectotympanic and the skull, the tympanic annulus is more or less ringlike because the posterior (ventral) limb is not expanded to form part of the floor of the middle ear cavity. By contrast, in some taxa with direct ectotympanic suspension, the Whereas the ectotympanic (ect) is suspended from the skull by attachments both to the petrosal (pet) and to the malleus (mal) in Marmosops, the ectotympanic of Philander is suspended only from the malleus (there is no attachment to the petrosal). Other abbreviations: atp, alisphenoid tympanic process; pro, promontorium (of petrosal); rtp, rostral tympanic process (of petrosal); sq, squamosal.",

The ectotympanics of Recent diprotodontians differ strikingly from those of didelphids and other marsupials, principally by forming tubelike extensions of the ear canal, by ankylosis or fusion with neighboring bones, and by dorsal migration and narrowing or closure of the incisura tympanica (Aplin, 1990) .",

Taxa with columelliform stapes include Caluromysiops, Lestodelphys, and several species of Monodelphis (e.g., M. peruviana, M. theresa).",

                "text": "OCCIPUT: Fusion of the supraoccipital with the interparietal is common to all didelphids and occurs very early in postnatal life as has already been discussed, so the dorsal part of the lambdoid crest is not associated with any visible sutures, nor does it develop sesamoids for the insertion of nuchal muscles (as in peramelemorphians, see below). The crest itself is only weakly developed in juveniles and in adult specimens of the smaller forms, but it is prominent in fully adult specimens of all of the larger opossums. The mastoid (pars mastoideus of the petrosal) is always prominently exposed on the lateral occiput, where it is bordered by the supraoccipital, exoccipital, squamosal, and sometimes the parietal. All didelphids have a well-developed mastoid process at the ventrolateral corner of the occiput that is sometimes provided with a sesamoid. The dorsal margin of the foramen magnum is formed by the exoccipitals and the supraoccipital in most didelphids ( fig. 13A ). In taxa that conform to this morphology, the foramen has a distinct middorsal emargination, the incisura occipitalis, that separates the left and right exoccipitals. By contrast, medial processes of the left and right exoccipitals are joined at the midline above the foramen magnum-excluding the supraoccipital from the dorsal margin of the foramen and occluding the incisura (fig .  13C )-in adult specimens of Didelphis, Lutreolina, Metachirus, and Philander. Juvenile (and some subadult) specimens of these genera, however, resemble other didelphids in their occipital morphology, such that both conditions (presence and absence of a supraoccipital margin) can be observed in ontogenetic series of conspecific skulls (Abdala et al., 2001: fig. 3 ). The medial processes of the exoccipitals are closely approximated in Chironectes, but in all of the specimens we examined the supraoccipital still forms part of the dorsal margin of the foramen magnum (contra S\u00e1 nchez-Villagra and Wible, 2002) , and the incisura occipitalis persists as a narrow middorsal notch.",

Commonly illustrated but seldom labeled or described by authors, these are the lambdoid sesamoids of Filan (1990) , who hypothesized that they function as force multipliers for M. rectus capitis dorsalis and other head extensors. Another occipital feature that might be unique to peramelemorphians is a sesamoid that is probably associated with the origin of the posterior belly of the digastric; this small bone occupies the apex of the paroccipital process in some peramelemorphians (e.g., Perameles), but it attaches to the otherwise smooth ventrolateral corner of the exoccipital in taxa that lack a paroccipital process (e.g., Microperoryctes).",

The masseteric fossa (a prominent concavity for the insertion of the eponymous muscle on the posterolateral surface of the jaw) is always imperforate, and its posteroventral border is defined by a distinct shelf. The articular condyle is transversely elongate and more or less semicylindrical. Although substantial variation in mandibular shape is apparent from the drawings that accompany our systematic accounts (figs. 37-54), other features are more readily characterized for taxonomic diagnoses and phylogenetic inference. Most didelphids have two mental foramina that perforate the lateral surface of the horizontal ramus, of which the more anterior is usually larger and located below p1 or p2, and the more posterior is usually smaller and located below p3 or m1. Chironectes, howev-er, has only a single mental foramen, which is very large and occupies the same position as the anterior foramen in those taxa with two lateral mandibular perforations.",

The crowns of I2-I5 in most didelphids are approximately symmetrical, labiolingually compressed rhomboids with subequal anterior (mesial) and posterior (distal) cutting edges that converge to form a sharp central apex; usually, a distinct anterior angle (mesiostyle) and a posterior angle (distostyle) can be seen on unworn teeth ( fig. 18A ). This is the morphology that Takahashi (1974: 414) termed ''premolariform'', as exemplified by Monodelphis, Marmosa, and Metachirus in her study. In many taxa with posterior upper incisors of this type, the tooth crowns increase in length (anteroposterior or mesiodistal dimension) from front to back, such that I2 appears visibly smaller than I5 in labial view. This tendency is very pronounced in some taxa with premolariform incisors (e.g., Marmosops, Metachirus) but seems to grade imperceptibly (via intermediate morphologies) to the essentially uniform toothrows of other taxa (e.g., Lestodelphys, Tlacuatzin) in which I2 and I5 are subequal in crown length.",

On unworn teeth of these taxa, the anterior angle (mesiostyle) is more frequently distinct than is the posterior angle (distostyle), which is often entirely lacking on I5 ( fig. 18B ).

However, the unworn juvenile dentitions of Chironectes that we examined have approximately symmetrical, rhomboidal crowns. There is a tendency (more marked in Glironia than in other genera of this category) for I2-I5 to decrease in crown length from front to back, such that I2 is sometimes visibly larger than I5 in labial view.

Although there appears to be no developmental data to support this notion, we observed that I5 is small and occupies a separate alveolus from I2-I4 (whose alveoli are usually at least partially confluent) in some taxa with five upper incisors (e.g., Glironia, Hyladelphys), and that the loss of such a tooth would simply enlarge an already existing diastema between the incisors and C1 rather than opening a fresh gap in the dental arcade. a The system adopted here was used by Tate (1933) and is currently followed by most metatherian researchers (e.g., Marshall et al., 1995; Rougier et al., 1998; Wroe et al., 2000; Voss and Jansa, 2003) . Note that there is no substantive inconsistency in the literature regarding the identification of I1-I5, C1, or c1. In order to focus these comparisons on real differences in assumptions about dental homologies, semantically equivalent notations used by authors (e.g., I 2 for i2, pm 3 for P3) have been modified as necessary to conform with our usage. b Also Thomas (1888), who assumed that marsupials primitively had four premolars, of which the second was lost. c Based on the assumption that the replaced teeth are M1/m1 (Archer, 1978) , this is the nomenclature followed throughout most of the marsupial literature for the next 10 years (e.g., Reig et al., 1987) . d Based on the assumption that marsupials primitively had five lower incisors, of which the first was lost (Hershkovitz, 1982) . Note that whereas Hershkovitz (1992b) accepted Archer's (1984) system of postcanine homologies, Hershkovitz (1997 Hershkovitz ( , 1999 did not. e The only difference between Luckett's (1993) notation and ours concerns his designation of the anterior premolars as first-generation (formerly deciduous) teeth. Although we do not dispute his interpretation of the developmental data at hand, we think it confusing to use deciduous notation for unreplaced teeth. f Goin's (1997) system was based on Hershkovitz's (1982) theory that the ancestral first lower incisor of marsupials is missing in living taxa, and on Archer's (1978) conjecture that replaced teeth in the upper and lower dentition are molars; by designating these as M0/m0, Goin intended to preserved traditional notation for the permanent molariform teeth.",

The unworn posterior incisors have approximately rhomboidal crowns with subequal anterior and posterior cutting edges that converge to a sharp apex in most dasyurids and in Dromiciops, but I2-4 in caenolestids have strikingly asymmetrical crowns (appropriately described as ''hatchet-shaped'' by Osgood, 1921: 117) , the posterior margins of which are deeply notched in Rhyncholestes (see Osgood, 1924: figs. 3b, c; Bublitz, 1987: fig. 13 ). In peramelemorphians, I2-4 are flat crowned (like I1), but I5 (when present) is caniniform. All of the upper incisors are single rooted in dasyurids, caenolestids, Dromiciops, and many peramelemorphians, but I5 is double rooted in Perameles gunnii. UPPER CANINE: The didelphid upper canine (C1) is invariably separated from the posteriormost upper incisor by a wide diastema that may or may not contain a distinct paracanine fossa for the reception of the lower canine. In most didelphids, C1 occupies the premaxillary-maxillary suture, despite the fact that the maxilla always extends anterolaterally beyond this tooth, sometimes reaching the alveolus of I5; therefore, the premaxilla only contacts the C1 alveolus medially ( fig. 14) . In Caluromys and Caluromysiops, however, the upper canine alveolus is entirely contained within the maxilla (figs. 38, 39). The upper canine is a simple unicuspid tooth in most didelphids, but some species (e.g., Gracilinanus emiliae; Voss et al., 2001 : fig. 12A ) have a small posterior accessory cusp, and others (e.g., Marmosops pinheiroi; fig. 53 ) have both anterior and posterior accessory cusps. Some care is needed in determining canine crown morphology, however, because accessory cusps are sometimes obliterated by wear (as inferred from their absence in old adults of species that uniformly exhibit such structures as juveniles and subadults). Alternatively, a false posterior accessory cusp is sometimes formed when the trailing edge of C1 is notched by occlusion with p1. Unlike other teeth whose size does not increase ontogenetically after the crown is fully erupted, didelphid canines often appear much larger in older adults than in younger animals because the root is continuously extruded from the alveolus throughout life.",

In most opossums dP3 is, indeed, a sizable tooth: its crown area ranges from about 42% to 96% of the crown area of M1, the tooth immediately behind it (Voss et al., 2001: table 5 ). An obviously functional element of the upper toothrow, dP3 occludes with both the deciduous lower premolar (dp3) and with m1. Hyladelphys, however, has a very small upper milk premolar (,10% of the crown area of M1; op. cit.) that appears to be functionally vestigial because it does not occlude with any lower tooth. Although molariform, the didelphid upper milk premolar does not always match the teeth behind it in all occlusal details. In most specimens, the paracone of dP3 is located on the labial margin of the crown, and the stylar shelf is correspondingly incomplete, whereas the paracone is lingual to a continuous stylar shelf on all didelphid molars (see below).

A broad stylar shelf and an anterolabial cingulum are invariably present; the centrocrista (postparacrista + premetacrista) and the ectoloph (preparacrista + centrocrista + postmetacrista) are uninterupted by gaps; the para-and metaconules are indistinct or absent; 15 and there is no posterolingual talon. In addition, most didelphids have several (usually five or six) small cusps on the stylar shelf, for which most authors employ alphabetical labels (after Bensley, 1906; Simpson, 1929; Clemens, 1966) . Of these, stylar cusp B (labial to the paracone) is more consistently recognizable than the others, but a stylar cusp in the D position (labial to the metacone) is often subequal to it in size. Didelphids differ conspicuously in the relative width (transverse or labial-lingual dimension) of successive molars within toothrows. In some taxa, the anterior molars tend to be wide in proportion to more posterior teeth, but in others the posterior molars are relatively wider ( fig. 21 ). The ratio obtained by dividing the width of M4 by the width of M1 (M4/M1; table 8) conveniently indexes this size-independent shape variation and ranges from a minimal value of 0.83 (in Caluromysiops) to a maximal value of 1.76 (in Lutreolina). Morphometric comparisons of dental measurements (Voss and Jansa, 2003: fig. 12 ) and visual inspections of toothrows suggest that this index is correlated with a pattern of molar occlusal transformation that has been described in the literature as ''carnassialization'' (Reig and Simpson, 1972: 534) or as ''an emphasis on postvallum-prevalid shear'' (Muizon and Lange-Badr\u00e9, 1997) . These tendencies are redundantly described by numerous dental ratios that have been coded as independent characters in previous phylogenetic studies (for an extended discussion, see Voss and Jansa, 2003) .",

Although the endpoints of this morphocline are strikingly different, the essentially continuous distribution of intermediate morphologies renders any attempt to make qualitative distinctions based on molar proportions an arbitrary exercise. We therefore employ ''not carnassialized,'' ''weakly carnassialized,'' ''moderately carnassialized,'' and ''strongly carnassialized'' as heuristic descriptors of a visually compelling but phylogenetically intractable aspect of didelphid dental variation. 16 The ectoflexus is a V-shaped labial indentation of the stylar shelf that is either present or absent on tribosphenic marsupial molars. Among didelphids, Caluromys and Caluromysiops are the only taxa that lack any trace of an ectoflexus (e.g., figs. 21A, B). In most other opossums, a distinct ectoflexus is present on M3, on M2 and M3, or (rarely) on M1-M3. When ectoflexi are present on multiple teeth, they invariably increase in depth from anterior to posterior.",

This results in the formation of a continuous shelf along the anterior margin of the tooth ( fig. 21A-D) , and taxa possessing this feature are sometimes said to have a ''complete'' anterior cingulum (Archer, 1976b: 3) or to exhibit ''double rank prevallum-postvallid shearing'' (Cifelli, 1993: 213) . In the alternative morphology-exhibited by Chacodelphys, Chironectes, Didelphis, Lestodelphys, Lutreolina, Metachirus, Monodelphis, Philander, Thylamys, and other species of Cryptonanus and Marmosops-the preprotocrista extends only to a point at or near the base of the paracone; the anterolabial cingulum does not converge toward the preprotocrista in these taxa, but passes obliquely dorsally such that the two crests are discontinuous on the anterior surface of the tooth crown ( fig. 21E, F ). Voss and Jansa (2003: 39) discussed several inconsistencies in the published literature concerning the distribution of these traits among didelphids. The postprotocrista also exhibits noteworthy variation among didelphids. In most genera, this crest decreases in height and width as it passes posterolabially around the base of the metacone before merging with the posterior surface of the tooth crown, leaving a distinct groove or gap in the posterior wall of the trigon basin. By contrast, the postprotocrista connects directly with the base of the metacone, such that the posterior wall of the trigon basin has no gap or groove, in Chironectes, Didelphis, Lutreolina, and Philander; instead, the unworn postprotocrista of these taxa exhibits a distinct carnassial notch near the base of the metacone.",

Indeed, some dasyurids and didelphids are indistinguishable in published matrices of upper molar characters (e.g., Archer, 1976b : table  1) , although there is a tendency for stylar cusp D to be larger than stylar cusp B when both structures are present in the former group (Wroe, 1997) , and a few dasyurids (e.g., Sarcophilus) are conspicuously divergent in other upper molar traits. The upper molars of Dromiciops differ from those of most didelphids by having a linear centrocrista, indistinct stylar cusps, and a stylar shelf that is conspicuously reduced in width labial to the paracone on M1. 17 The upper molars of Recent peramelemorphians differ from those of didelphids in several respects, most notably by having a discontinuous centrocrista: instead of forming a '-shaped (labially inflected) crest with an apex that is lingual to the stylar shelf, the postparacrista and the premetacrista of modern peramelemorphians terminate on the labial margin of the tooth, where they are separated by a small gap (Muirhead and Filan [1995] referred to this trait as the result of the centrocrista ''breaching'' the ectoloph). Additionally, all modern peramelemophians have a large posterolingual cusp on M1-M3; in most genera (e.g., Echymipera, Perameles) this is a hypertrophied metaconule, but in Macrotis it is the metacone (Archer, 1976b) . Another peramelemorphian trait is that the preparacrista of M1 is a tall crest that passes posterolabially to a large stylar cusp at or near the C position (Archer, 1976b) . The anterolabial cingulum is present in some peramelemorphians (e.g., Echymipera) but not in others (e.g., Perameles).",

In both Caenolestes and Rhyncholestes, the paracone is absent (or indistinguishably fused with stylar cusp B). The metacone is also absent in Rhyncholestes but, although fused to the lingual aspect of stylar cusp D, the metacone is still clearly recognizable in Caenolestes. Given this interpretation of caenolestid cusp homologies, it follows that a low crest along the labial base of the tooth crowns in both genera is a neomorphic cingulum rather than a vestigial stylar shelf. The first two caenolestid upper molars also have a well-developed posterolingual cusp that has been interpreted either as a hypertrophied metaconule (Marshall, 1987; Goin and Candela, 2004; Goin et al., 2007) or as a neomorphic outgrowth of the postprotocingulum (Hunter and Jernvall, 1995) .

Among other marsupials, Dromiciops resembles didelphids in having four lower incisors, whereas dasyurids and peramelemorphians have only three.

Because the presence of two lower premolars (each with two roots; Osgood, 1921) is undisputed, only one of the problematic unicuspids could belong to this series. Hershkovitz (1982) implied that none of the lower incisor alveoli of caenolestids are staggered, but he later (Hershkovitz, 1995) stated that Recent caenolestids have a staggered i2 (''i3'').

LOWER MILK PREMOLAR: Taxonomically significant variation among didelphids in the size and shape of dp3 was reported by Voss et al. (2001: table 5) . Many didelphids (Caluromys lanatus, Caluromysiops, Chironectes, Cryptonanus chacoensis, Didelphis, Lutreolina, Marmosops, Metachirus, Monodelphis emiliae, Philander) have a fully molariform dp3 in which the trigonid is represented by its normal complement of three cusps (paraconid, protoconid, metaconid) in a more or less triangular configuration ( fig. 24, top) . A fully molariform dp3 is also the modal condition for Monodelphis brevicaudata, in which seven of nine specimens examined with intact milk dentitions had complete trigonids. By contrast, dp3 is only partially molariform in Cryptonanus unduaviensis, Gracilinanus agilis, Lestodelphys, Marmosa, and Thylamys, which have incomplete, blade-like trigonids bearing only one or two distinct cusps ( fig. 24, bottom) . Although just the protoco-nid of dp3 is usually distinct in our material of Caluromys philander, the trigonid of this taxon is triangular in occlusal outline and more closely resembles the fully molariform condition than the blade-like uni-or bicuspid alternative. Among other plesiomorphic marsupials that we examined, only Dromiciops has a large and fully molariform dp3, whereas dasyurids and peramelemorphians have small, structurally simplified and obviously vestigial lower milk premolars.",

Among these, the labial prominence of the hypoconid tends to vary along the toothrow, so we standardized comparisons at the third molar locus. In most opossums, the hypoconid is labially salient (projecting beyond the protoconid or level with it) on m3, but the hypoconid is lingual to the protoconid in Chacodelphys, Lestodelphys, Lutreolina, and Monodelphis. Most didelphids have a well-developed entoconid that is about as tall as the hypoconid and much exceeds the adjacent hypoconulid in height and breadth on m1-m3 ( fig. 25, top) . In Chacodelphys and Monodelphis, however, the entoconid is very small, never more than subequal to the hypoconulid, and often smaller than that cusp (fig. 25, bottom) ; it becomes indistinct or is obliterated by wear in most adult specimens. Discrepant observations in the literature about didelphid entoconid size variation were discussed by Voss and Jansa (2003) .",

Unfortunately, didelphid DMP1 sequences cannot be aligned unambiguously with sequences from nondidelphid marsupials, so no outgroups are available to root phylogenetic analyses of this gene (Jansa and Voss, 2005; Jansa et al., 2006) .",

Recombination activating genes are expressed only in the nucleus of developing B and T lymphocytes, where the RAG1 and RAG2 proteins act synergistically to make double-stranded breaks at specific recognition sequences, initiating recombination of variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) gene segments; completion of the V(D)J rearrangement process yields functional immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor proteins, an essential step in the development of a mature immune system (Gellert, 2002) . Nucleotide sequence data from RAG1 have previously been analyzed in several vertebrate phylogenetic studies (e.g., Groth and Barrowclough, 1999; Barker et al., 2002; Baker et al., 2004; Gruber et al., 2007) . The 2790 bp fragment that we amplified and sequenced for this study is homologous with a single full-length copy in Monodelphis domestica, where the gene is apparently located on chromosome 5. Although RAG1 occupies the same chromosome as DMP1, the considerable distance that separates these loci (.2 3 10 8 bp) suggests that they belong to different linkage groups. We obtained fulllength RAG1 sequences from 41 didelphids (excluding Caluromysiops and Lestodelphys), and we downloaded shorter (543 bp) outgroup sequences from Genbank. Ingroup and outgroup sequences all translate to open reading frame. Only two indels (of 6 bp each) were required to align didelphid RAG1 sequences; one indel is unique to Metachirus nudicaudatus, whereas the other is shared by Marmosops parvidens and M. pinheiroi.",

However, GC content at third codon positions (GC 3 ) of DMP1 is substantially higher in two taxa (Hyladelphys and Tlacuatzin) than it is in other didelphids (Jansa and Voss, 2005) . As reported elsewhere, third codon positions of RAG1 are so highly variable in GC content among didelphids that plausible phylogenetic results cannot be recovered from datasets that include these positions (Gruber et al., 2007) ; therefore, only first and second codon positions of RAG1 are analyzed below. The GC content of vWF is most similar to that of RAG1, but vWF does not exhibit the exceptionally high taxonomic variation in GC 3 seen in the latter gene.

In addition, the best-fitting model for each gene includes among-site rate heterogeneity as approximated by a gamma distribu-tion (C), and a proportion of invariant sites (p inv ) applies to three genes. Fitted basecompositional parameters (pA, pC, pG, pT) for GTR-modeled loci are relatively even for IRBP, slightly skewed towards A for the RAG1 partition, strongly skewed towards A for BRCA1, and strongly biased towards A and G for DMP1. All five genes exhibit higher rates of transitions than transversions; in addition, first and second positions of RAG1 exhibit a relatively high rate of A-to-C transversions. The degree of among-site rate heterogeneity was lowest for BRCA1 (a 51.48), and highest for the RAG1 partition (a 5 0.41).",

Because our analytic results for IRBP and DMP1 have already been published (Jansa and Voss, 2005) , only summary comments are warranted here. Briefly, the monophyly of all genera represented by two or more terminal taxa is strongly supported by both of these genes (figs. 28, 29) with the exception of Gracilinanus (weakly to moderately supported by IRBP, not recovered as monophyletic by DMP1), Thylamys (only weakly supported by Bayesian analysis of DMP1), and Didelphis (inconsistently recovered as monophyletic by analyses of IRBP). On the assumption that the DMP1 tree (lacking outgroup terminals) is appropriately rooted within a node or two of Glironia, several patterns of intergeneric relationships are also supported by both genes, including the nested clades (Metachirus (Chironectes (Lutreolina (Didelphis + Philander)))); a group that includes Lestodelphys and Thylamys; a group that includes Cryptonanus, Gracilinanus, and Lestodelphys + Thylamys; a group that includes the latter four genera plus Marmosops; and a group that includes Marmosa, Monodelphis, and Tlacuatzin. As reported elsewhere (Jansa and Voss, 2005) , there are no examples of hard incongruence to be found in comparing analytic results between IRBP and DMP1 because all conflicting nodes (e.g., those resolving the position of Hyladelphys) have weak support from one or both genes.",

A novel result (uniquely recovered with strong support by BRCA1 but not strongly contradicted by any other gene) is the sister-group relationship between Marmosa and Tlacuatzin.

Although we are convinced that Chacodelphys is closely related to Lestodelphys and Thylamys by a host of phenotypic resemblances too indefinite to code as characters but too numerous to ignore, a compelling analytic solution to this vexing problem is unlikely to be forthcoming until at least some of the missing molecular data for Chacodelphys can be obtained from fresh material.",

Glironia is of special concern, because the two plausible phylogenetic resolutions for this genus (fig. 34A, B) determine the root of the didelphid radiation. The alternative phylogenetic resolutions of Cryptonanus and Tlacuatzin within their respective groups do not seem like comparably weighty issues, but each could affect ecobehavioral character optimizations of significant evolu-tionary interest. Phenotypically, Cryptonanus is certainly more similar to Gracilinanus than it is to Thylamys or Lestodelphys, whereas Tlacuatzin is undeniably more similar to Marmosa than it is to Monodelphis.

To be sure, the chronological and bibliographic details of didelphid taxonomy are of limited interest, so the following paragraphs mention only a few milestones on the long road to the currently accepted classification. Because most of the technical information about how and why names were formerly applied to taxa was recently summarized by Gardner (2008) , this brief narrative is primarily intended to serve as an introduction to the revised phylogenetic system that we propose. Linnaeus (1758) described only five species of marsupials, all of which were didelphids. Although the four Linnaean species currently recognized as valid (marsupialis, philander, opossum, and murina) are now referred to different genera, the great Swede placed all of them in the genus Didelphis. New generic names for opossums proliferated over subsequent decades of the 18th and 19th centuries (table 15), but no consistent binomial usage had emerged prior to Thomas's (1888) land- Cerqueira and Tribe (2008) . g Subsequently designated by . h Subsequently designated by Thomas (1888) ; see Hershkovitz (1976) . i Subsequently designated by Hershkovitz (1949) , but authorship and dates misattributed by him are emended herein. j By original designation. k Grayium was proposed as a replacement name for Marmosa Gray, 1821, on the mistaken assumption that the latter was preoccupied by Marmosa Rafinesque, 1815, a nomen nudum (Creighton and Gardner, 2008b) . mark catalog of the marsupials in the British Museum of Natural History. By comparison with Old World marsupials, didelphids appeared to Thomas (1888: 315) to be ''an exceedingly homogeneous [family], its members presenting a very small range of differentiation.'' Accordingly, he recognized only Didelphis and Chironectes as full genera, but several other taxa were ranked as subgenera of Didelphis (table 16) . These included Metachirus (containing species now referred to Metachirus, Philander, and Lutreolina), Philander (for Caluromys), Micoureus (containing species now referred to Marmosa, Marmosops, Thylamys, and Gracilinanus), and Peramys (for Monodelphis).",

However, Matschie recognized more subgenera of Didelphis than Thomas did, resurrecting old names or describing new ones to suit his needs. Dromiciops (described as a didelphid by Thomas, 1894) was also included. Matschie's taxonomy is noteworthy for his early recognition that the so-called ''murine'' opossums (pouchless mouse-and rat-sized species with circumocular masks and long tails) that Thomas (1888) had lumped together in Micoureus actually represent several distinct groups, and for treating those groups as coordinate taxa. Cabrera's (1919) classification was not the first to reject Linnaeus's inclusive concept of Didelphis, but it was influential in establishing modern binomial usage. His taxonomy included 11 genera, only one of which contained subgenera. Like Thomas (1888) and , Cabrera made no use of subfamilies, tribes, or other suprageneric categories to indicate relationships among living opossums. Unlike Matschie, Cabrera grouped all of the ''murine'' opossums together, using Marmosa as the name for the taxon that Thomas called Micoureus. Simpson (1945) recognized several subfamilies of didelphids, but he placed all of the living opossums (plus Dromiciops) in the a Incorrect spellings (e.g., ''Didelphys'' for Didelphis; Thomas, 1888) have been changed to conform with current usage throughout, but the sequence of names in each classification has been preserved as originally published.

In effect, his treatment of Recent didelphids amounted to no more than an alphabetic list of generic names, conveying even less information about inferred relationships than the classifications of his predecessors. Cabrera's (1958) checklist of South American mammals was one of the last attempts to classify Recent opossum diversity by traditional (prephylogenetic) criteria, and it remained more or less unchallenged until the advent of molecular systematics in the mid-1970s. Despite the fact that at least some contemporaneous researchers (e.g., Reig, 1955) recognized suprageneric groups among living opossumlike marsupials, Cabrera did not. Instead, only his taxonomic sequence and his use of subgenera for Monodelphis and Marmosa hint at inferred patterns of relationships. Most of the generic names that Cabrera recognized as valid are still used in the same sense today, with the conspicuous exception of Marmosa: whereas the nominotypical subgenus contained (in addition to Marmosa sensu stricto) species now referred to Marmosops, the subgenus Thylamys contained (in addition to Thylamys sensu stricto) species now referred to Chacodelphys, Cryptonanus, and Gracilinanus. Reig et al. (1985) provided the first classification of opossumlike marsupials based on an explicitly phylogenetic analysis (subsequently published by Reig et al., 1987) , and their classification was also the first to incorporate results from molecular and cytogenetic research (Kirsch, 1977b; Reig et al., 1977) . Not surprisingly, this classification (table 17) departed from its predecessors in several respects. Among them, Dromiciops was once and for all removed to a separate family, ''caluromyines'' and didelphines were distinguished as separate subfamilies, and several tribes of the latter were recognized: all of the large opossums with a diploid number (2n) of 22 chromosomes were referred to the Didelphini, all of the smaller taxa with 2n 5 14-18 chromosomes were referred to the Marmosini (thus implying a close relationship between Monodelphis and the ''murine'' opossums), and a monotypic tribe was created for Metachirus.",

Taxonomic rank aside, these taxa represent significant departures from previous classifications by grouping Metachirus with Monodelphis and the ''murine'' opossums, by the absence of any formal relationship between this group (Marmosidae) and the large opossums with 22 chromosomes (Didelphidae), and by the separation of Glironia on the one hand from Caluromys and Caluromysiops on the other. Also unlike other classifications, four ''murine'' genera (Gracilinanus, Marmosops, Marmosa, Micoureus) were associated in a single taxon (Marmosinae) that excluded Thylamys and Lestodelphys. Kirsch and Palma (1995) formalized the results of their DNA-DNA hybridization experiments in a classification that, for the first time, associated Metachirus (as a monotypic tribe) with the large 2n 5 22 opossums (Didelphini) , associated Monodelphis with Marmosa and Micoureus, and recognized the other ''murine'' opossums (Gracilinanus, Lestodelphys, Marmosops, Thylamys) as forming a separate clade. All of these taxa were referred to the family Didelphidae, whereas Glironia, Caluromys, and Caluromysiops were referred to the Caluromyidae.",

Points (1) and (2) should be familiar to most readers and, we trust, are not controversial. Point (3) might be disputed by those who feel that cladograms should be completely described by classifications, but the mnemonic value of names is lost if they proliferate beyond reasonable need, the hierarchical ordering implied by the consistent use of familiar suffixes (e.g., -idae, -inae, -ini) is compromised if many clade names with unfamiliar endings are interpolated, and naming weakly supported clades that might disappear when new character data or taxa are added to future analyses is not in the interest of nomenclatural stability. Point (4) refers to long branches, which can be interpreted as artifacts of extinction or Reig et al. (1987) and Marshall et al. (1990) . b The classification of Hershkovitz (1992a) differs from this one in minor details. Hershkovitz (1997) incomplete taxon sampling (Horovitz, 1999) ; this notion provides some justification for naming monotypic higher taxa to accommodate future discoveries of new forms.

Because most Cretaceous and early Tertiary metatherians are known only from teeth, this trait provides a potentially useful criterion for distinguishing stem taxa from members of the crown clade. For example, several of the Paleocene Brazilian fossils classified as didelphids by Marshall (1987) are described by that author as having posterior cingulids and might plausibly be regarded on that basis as stem metatherians. By contrast, Marsupialia (in the crown-group sense) does not seem to be diagnosable by any upper molar trait.",

Bone homologies on the posterodorsal braincase have received little attention in the literature, but they appear to be phylogenetically informative at many taxonomic levels within Metatheria. In particular, the presence of a large undivided interparietal bone that is wedged between the parietals anteriorly and fused to the supraoccipital posteriorly may be a didelphid synapomorphy. According to Muizon (1998: 38, fig. 6 ), paired interparietal ossifications are fused to the parietals in {Mayulestes, but the basis for this interpretation (which has no analog among living metatherians) is not explained, and it seems equally possible that the interparietal(s) is(are) absent in this taxon. In {Pucadelphys, paired interparietals (''postparietals'') are suturally distinct from the parietals and from the supraoccipital (Marshall et al., 1995: 50, fig. 12 ). The occiput of {Herpetotherium has not previously been described, but in a well-preserved specimen that we examined (127684 in the AMNH vertebrate paleontology catalog) there is no bone wedged between the parietals and the supraoccipital, which share a suture just behind the lambdoid crest.

Spermatozooa, for example, have not been studied from many genera (e.g., Caluromysiops, Glironia, Hyladelphys, Lutreolina, Marmosops, Thylamys), and published phylogenetic analyses of postcranial and petrosal characters have not included basal didelphids (analyzed didelphid terminal taxa in both of the osteological studies cited above belong to the subfamily Didelphinae).

Although the genus probably also occurs in southeastern Colombia, no specimens are known to have been collected there (D\u00edaz and Willig, 2004) . Most records accompanied by definite habitat information are from primary or secondary Amazonian rainforest, but a single specimen was recently reported from the upper Paraguay Basin (Santos-Filho et al., 2007) , and several Bolivian records are from dry forest (Tarifa and Anderson, 1997; Emmons, 1998) .",

Two deletions at the DMP1 locus that currently optimize as synapomorphies of Caluromys (fig. 29 ) might prove to be caluromyine synapomorphies when this gene is eventually sequenced for Caluromysiops. Although most recent authors (e.g., Reig et al., 1985 Reig et al., , 1987 Kirsch and Palma, 1995; McKenna and Bell, 1997; Gardner, 2005 Gardner, , 2008 have included Glironia in the Caluromyinae (or Caluromyidae), that genus appears to represent an ancient lineage of basal didelphids that may not be closely related to Caluromys + Caluromysiops (see Jansa and Voss, 2000;  this report, above). The authorship of familygroup names based on Caluromys is often attributed to Kirsch (1977b) , but no such name in that work fulfills the technical criteria for nomenclatural availability (ICZN, 1999: Article 13) . Apparently, the first explicit statement of characters purported to differentiate this taxon from other opossums appeared in Reig et al. (1987: 72) .",

Among other features, Caluromysiops differs from Caluromys by its lack of a circumocular mask and dark midrostral stripe, presence of dark scapular stripes, shorter tail (table 5), absence of a premaxillary rostral process, co-ossified frontals, presence of a well-developed sagittal crest, presence of a secondary foramen ovale, globular (versus conical) alisphenoid bullae, columelliform stapes, linear centrocrista, and untwinned hypoconulid. Although there is no cladistic problem with combining these taxa under a single generic name, maintaining current binomial usage is likewise unobjectionable and serves to separate the monophyletic cluster of species currently known as Caluromys from its long-branched sister taxon.",

Although the issue of rank is not biologically meaningful, the former option serves to emphasize the intermediate position of this odd little opossum between basal didelphids (Glironia and caluromyines) and the speciose radiation of lineages that are more closely related to Didelphis. The branch leading to Hyladelphys is very long in most molecular reconstructions of didelphid anagenesis (e.g., fig. 33 ), suggesting an ancient history of independent evolution accompanied by extinction of transitional forms; the same conclusion is suggested by its uniquely reduced milk dentition and by characters of the postcranial skeleton (Flores, 2009) . In effect, excluding Hyladelphys from Didelphinae simplifies the diagnosis of the latter clade and provides a new higher taxon to accommodate fossil relatives of the former, should any be discovered.",

DIAGNOSIS: Members of this clade uniquely differ from other didelphids by lacking an anterior cutting edge on P3 (the third upper premolar is double bladed in all basal didelphids). In addition, Didelphinae differs from Glironiinae by having a caudal dorsum that is macroscopically naked, at least near the tip; an unpaired median teat; welldeveloped posterolateral palatal corners; and postorbital processes that (when present) are formed only by the frontals. Didelphinae additionally differs from Caluromyinae by having a shorter fourth manual digit (dIII is subequal to or longer than dIV), an incompletely ossified palate (maxillopalatine and sometimes other fenestrae are invariably present), transverse canal foramina, a wide gap between the alisphenoid tympanic process and the rostral tympanic process of the petrosal, an acute and strongly inflected mandibular angle, an upper canine alveolus that lies within the premaxillary-maxillary suture, a nonvestigial P1, a larger P3 (subequal to or taller than P2), and a distinct ectoflexus on M3.

To the best of our knowledge, the first familygroup name based on Marmosa is technically available from Hershkovitz (1992b) . An alternative name for this clade is Monodelphini, which McKenna and Bell (1997) attributed to Talice et al. (1961) . However, Talice et al. did not mention any characters purported to differentiate Monodelphini from other didelphids, so their name is unavailable (ICZN, 1999: Article 13) . To the best of our knowledge, the first familygroup name based on Monodelphis is also available from Hershkovitz (1992b) . As first revisors in the sense of the Code (ICZN, 1999: Article 24), we select Marmosini , to have precedence over Monodelphini Hershkovitz, 1992. Our reluctance to recognize any subtribal distinction between Marmosa and Monodelphis is based on the uncertain position of Tlacuatzin, which is not convincingly resolved despite the large amount of data at hand (.2000 parsimony-informative characters; table 12). In the event that a sister-group relationship between Marmosa and Tlacuatzin (weakly indicated by supermatrix analyses; figs. 33-36) were strongly supported by some future dataset, it would then make sense to recognize one subtribe (e.g., Marmosina) for those taxa and another (Monodelphina) for Monodelphis and {Thylatheridium. Although it seems indisputable that Monodelphis and {Thylatheridium are closely related (Goin and Rey, 1997) , we note that this hypothesis has yet to be tested analytically, nor is it certainly known whether or not these taxa are reciprocally monophyletic. 25 Marmosa Figure 41",

Only a single morphological character, the possession of a rostral process of the premaxillae, optimizes as an unambiguous generic synapomorphy (appendix 5), but even this weak phenotypic evidence is compromised by the absence of a rostral process in M. xerophila, a species that we did not score for this study.",

Another would be to recognize Micoureus as a subgenus of Marmosa and to name new subgenera for other monophyletic clusters of Marmosa species. A third would be to recognize Micoureus as a genus and to describe new genera as needed to make Marmosa monophyletic. Unfortunately, the first option would result in the loss of a useful name (Micoureus, see below), whereas the second and third options are not currently workable because many species of Marmosa have not been included in any phylogenetic analysis, and their relationships are correspondingly obscure. Our interim solution is to move the currently intractable problem of paraphyly from the generic to the subgeneric level. Although taxonomic rank is biologically arbitrary, it affects binomial usage, which should be conformable with phylogenetic relationships insofar as these are known. In effect, because the use of generic names is obligatory under the current Linnaean system, it is crucial that genera be monophyletic.",

Where appropriate, this can be achieved using double quotes for the latter, as for the species Marmosa (''Marmosa'') lepida as contrasted with Marmosa (Micoureus) demerarae. Predictably, the subgeneric classification of Marmosa will be refined as future studies based on denser taxon sampling yield increasingly resolved estimates of relationships within this speciose group.",

Recent analyses of both mtDNA sequence data (e.g., by Patton et al., 2000; Patton and Costa, 2003) and morphological characters (Rossi, 2005) suggest that several nominal taxa currently listed as synonyms (e.g., of M. demerarae, M. murina, and M. robinsoni) are probably valid species.

Rhinarium with one ventrolateral groove on each side of median sulcus; dark circumocular mask absent; pale supraocular spot absent; dark midrostral stripe absent; throat gland present in adult males of most species but possibly absent in some (e.g., M. theresa). Dorsal pelage coloration highly variable, but dorsal hair bases always dark gray; dorsal guard hairs short and inconspicuous; ventral fur self-colored or gray based, highly variable in surface pigmentation. Manus mesaxonic (dIII . dIV); manual claws very long, extending well beyond fleshy apical pads of digits; dermatoglyph-bearing manual plantar pads present, but pads small and dermatoglyphs sometimes indistinct; central palmar epithelium smooth or sparsely tuberculate; carpal tubercles absent in both sexes. Pedal digits unwebbed; pedal digit III longer than digit IV; plantar surface of heel naked.

Because many morphological characters unambiguously diagnose the latter group, whereas only a few diagnose the group that includes the large 2n 5 22 opossums plus Metachirus (see appendix 5), the present arrangement seems preferable. Additionally, because the branch leading to Metachirus is a long one (e.g., in fig. 33 ), we expect that fossils will eventually be found to occupy it, and that such discoveries will minimally disrupt the suprageneric nomenclature if a tribe is already available to accommodate them.",

Published distribution maps (e.g., Reid, 1997; Gardner and Dagosto, 2008) indicate several range disjunctions, but some of these may be artifacts of inadequate collecting effort in suitable habitats.",

All of the diagnostic morphological features listed above, together with several other craniodental and karyotypic traits, optimize as unambiguous tribal synapomorphies (appendix 5).

As mapped by Marshall (1978d) , the geographic range of this genus is strikingly disjunct, but collecting localities subsequently reported by Anderson (1997) , Linares (1998) , and Brown (2004) have closed many distributional gaps. As mapped by Stein and Patton (2008a) , Chironectes appears to be absent from central Amazonia, but an unvouchered record from the lower Tapajos (George et al., 1988) suggests that this hiatus may be an artifact of inadequate collecting. Although water opossums are known to inhabit gallery-forested streams in the Cerrado (Mares et al., 1989) , there are no published records from the Caatinga and Chaco.",

                "text": "DISTRIBUTION: Didelphis is a quintessentially eurytopic genus that ranges from southern Canada throughout most of North America (except the Rockies, the northern Great Plains, the Great Basin, the arid southwest, north-central Mexico, and Baja California; Hall, 1981) , all of Central America, and most of South America (to about 40uS latitude in central Argentina; Flores et al., 2007) . South American collection records (mapped by Cerqueira and Tribe, 2008) represent almost every non-desert tropical and subtropical biome on the continent. REMARKS: Despite contradictory or ambiguous phylogenetic results from most sequenced loci analyzed separately (table 14) , the monophyly of Didelphis is strongly supported by parsimony and Bayesian analyses of morphology ( fig. 27 ), a concatenated five-gene dataset ( fig. 33) , and combined (nonmolecular + molecular) supermatrices (figs. 35, 36) . Revisionary studies of the genus Didelphis in its modern sense were initiated by Allen (1901 Allen ( , 1902 and continued by Krumbiegel (1941) , Gardner (1973) , Cerqueira (1985) , and Lemos and Cerqueira (2002) . Useful summaries of morphological characters that distinguish Didelphis species in local faunas are provided by Mondolfi and P\u00e9rez-Hern\u00e1 ndez (1984) , Catzeflis et al. (1997) , Cerqueira and Lemos (2000) , Flores and Abdala (2001) , and Ventura et al. (2002) .

Southern South American specimens (representing several nominal taxa in addition to the nominotypical subspecies L. c. crassicaudata) are much more commonly collected in a wide range of tropical, subtropical, and temperate habitats in Paraguay, Uruguay, eastern Bolivia, southern Brazil, and northern Argentina (Flores et al., 2007; Stein and Patton, 2008b) .",

                "text": "REMARKS: Although inconsistently supported by our separate nuclear-gene analyses (table 14) and by Patton et al.'s (1996) analyses of sequence data from the mitochondrial cytochrome b locus, the monophyly of Philander is moderately well supported by nonmolecular characters ( fig. 27 ) and it is strongly supported by our analyses of concatenated genes and combined datasets (figs. 33, 35, 36 ). The current species-level classification given above largely follows Patton and da Silva (1997) , who analyzed mtDNA haplotype diversity among 42 Central and South American specimens that they interpreted as representing six valid taxa (andersoni, canus, frenatus, fuscogriseus, mcilhennyi, opossum); three unsequenced taxa (azarica, melanurus, pallidus) were also recognized as valid on the basis of morphological traits. Whereas andersoni, frenatus, and mcilhennyi were recovered as monophyletic haplotype groups that Patton and da Silva recognized as monotypic species, their concept of opossum included several subspecies (azarica, canus, fuscogriseus, melanurus, pallida) and was not recovered as a clade. Based on their phylogenetic analysis (op. cit.: fig. 2 ), it would be logical to recognize fuscogriseus and canus as valid species, but the authors reasonably cautioned against facile taxonomic decisions based on the results of analyzing a single maternally inherited gene. Indeed, the genus clearly requires a more comprehensive revisionary treatment, with particular attention devoted to obtaining analyzable character data from hitherto unrepresented taxa (notably azarica, crucialis, grisescens, melanurus, and pallidus). Our placement of azarica in the synonymy of P. frenatus uncritically follows Gardner (2005) , who also allocated nominal taxa not treated by Patton and da Silva (1997) to the synonymy of P. opossum. Although an alternative species-level classification of Philander proposed by Hershkovitz (1997) was not based on any explicit analysis of specimen data, it raised several issues not adequately treated by other authors and drew attention to the possible existence of undescribed taxa. New species described by Lew et al. (2006) and Flores et al. (2008) contribute additional taxonomic complexities and underscore the need for critical revisionary work on this difficult genus.",

                "text": "The problematic relationships of this genus were discussed at length by Voss et al. (2004a) and seem unlikely to be resolved definitively in the absence of nuclear gene sequence data. As discussed above, the tribal membership of Chacodelphys is most compellingly supported by Bayesian analysis of a dataset that combines nonmolecular characters with nuclear-gene sequence data ( fig. 36 ), but it is consistent with subjective assessments of similarity based on integumental and craniodental traits (e.g., by Tate, 1933) . Although separate analyses of nonmolecular character data suggest that this genus may be more closely related to Thylamys and Lestodelphys than to other thylamyines ( fig.  27 ), it seems premature to formalize such weakly supported results by subtribal nomenclature.

DISTRIBUTION: Cryptonanus is known from mostly unforested tropical and subtropical biomes south of the Amazon River and east of the Andes, including the Caatinga, Cerrado, Chaco, and northern Pampas; collection localities mapped by Voss et al. (2005) and D'El\u00eda and Mart\u00ednez (2006) are from Paraguay, Uruguay, eastern Bolivia, northern Argentina, and eastern Brazil. REMARKS: Our species-level taxonomy of Cryptonanus follows Voss et al. (2005) who, however, cautioned that this arrangement is provisional and unsupported by rigorous tests of species limits. In particular, the genetic distinctness of C. agricolai, C. chacoensis, C. ignitus, and C. unduaviensis is not overwhelmingly indicated by available morphological data and merits careful evaluation. Molecular sequence comparisons would be an especially welcome supplement to the scant phenotypic evidence at hand. Gracilinanus Gardner and Creighton, 1989 Figure 50",

Hypoconid labially salient on m3; hypoconulid twinned with entoconid on m1-m3; entoconid taller than hypoconulid on m1-m3. DISTRIBUTION: Species of Gracilinanus occur in tropical and subtropical moist forests in lowland and montane landscapes (to at least 3350 m; Voss et al., 2004b: table 12) from northern Venezuela to Bolivia, Paraguay, southeastern Brazil, northeastern Argentina, and northern Uruguay (D'El\u00eda and Mart\u00ednez, 2006; Teta et al., 2007; Creighton and Gardner, 2008a) . Apparently, only one Argentinian record and two Uruguayan records of Gracilinanus are valid, the remaining published localities for this genus from both countries having been based on specimens of Cryptonanus (see Voss et al., 2005; D'El\u00eda and Mart\u00ednez, 2006; Teta et al., 2007) . Gracilinanus is said not to occur in central Amazonia (Patton and Costa, 2003) , but the species to be expected there (G. emiliae) is difficult to collect and this distributional hiatus is perhaps an artifact of inadequate faunal sampling. 30 REMARKS: The contents of this genus have changed significantly in the years since it was first described by Gardner and Creighton (1989) , principally by removal of distantly related forms to new genera (see Voss et al., 2005: table 1) . With the exception of Gracilinanus microtarsus and G. agilis, species of this genus are not common in museum collections, and geographic distributions remain poorly documented. In addition, current species concepts will doubtless change as more information becomes available. For example, molecular data (summarized by Costa et al., 2003) suggest the presence of an undescribed, morphologically cryptic species among the material currently identified as G. microtarsus; the geographic distribution of material currently identified as G. emiliae is improbably broad; and some specimens from northern Colombia and eastern Peru do not resemble any currently recognized taxa. Therefore, the species-level diversity of Gracilinanus seems certain to increase with future revisionary research.",

Pedal digits unwebbed; dIV longer than other pedal digits; plantar surface of heel macroscopically naked (a microscopic pelage of very short hairs, not coarse fur, is usually present). Pouch absent; mammae varying among examined species from 3-1-3 5 7 to 7-1-7 5 15, anteriormost pairs ''pectoral'' when mammae $11; cloaca present. Tail longer than combined length of head and body, slender and muscular (not incrassate), and macroscopically naked (without a conspicuously furred base); naked caudal integument uniformly dark (usually grayish), bicolored (dark above, pale below), or parti-colored (dark distally, paler distally); caudal scales in spiral series, each scale with three bristlelike hairs emerging from caudal margin; median hair of each caudal-scale triplet usually much thicker and darker than lateral hairs; ventral caudal surface modified for prehension distally (with naked median groove and apical pad bearing dermatoglyphs).",

The genus is also recovered with strong support by parsimony and Bayesian analyses of combined datasets that include nonmolecular and molecular characters (figs. 35, 36) , and by Bayesian analyses of nonmolecular characters ( fig. 27 ) and RAG1 sequences ( fig. 30 ). Spirally arranged caudal scales, the petiolate morphology of the central hair in each caudal-scale triplet, the presence of a rostral process of the premaxillae, and unique deletions at the DMP1 and BRCA1 loci optimize as unambiguous generic synapomorphies (appendix 5; figs. 29, 31).

Dorsal pelage usually grayish and distinctly darker middorally than laterally (''tricolored''), but dorsal fur brownish and without conspicuous patterning in T. karimii and T. velutinus (Carmignotto and Monfort, 2006) ; dorsal hair bases dark gray; dorsal guard hairs short and inconspicuous; ventral fur self-white in some species (e.g., T. pusillus), wholly or partly gray-based whitish or yellowish in others (e.g., T. venustus). Manus mesaxonic (dIII . dIV); manual claws about as long as fleshy apical pads in most species (but claws extend well beyond apical pads in T. karimii and T. velutinus; Carmignotto and Monfort, 2006) ; dermatoglyph-bearing manual plantar pads present in most species; central palmar epithelium densely covered with small convex tubercles; carpal tubercles absent in both sexes. Pedal digits unwebbed; dIV longer than other pedal digits; plantar surface of heel coarsely furred. Pouch absent; mammae varying among species from 4-1-4 5 9 (in T. karimii; Carmignotto and Monfort, 2006) to 7-1-7 5 15 (in T. elegans; Tate, 1933) , including ''pectoral'' teats (when the total number of mammae $ 11); cloaca present. Tail longer than combined length of head and body in most species (except in T. karimii and T. velutinus; Carmignotto and Monfort, 2006) ; apparently always incrassate (but quantity of stored fat may vary seasonally); furred only at base (to about the same extent dorsally as ventrally); unfurred caudal integument bicolored (dark above, pale below) in most species and parti-colored in some (T. macrurus has an all-white tail tip); tail scales in annular series, each scale with three subequal bristlelike hairs emerging from distal margin; ventral caudal surface modified for prehension distally (with naked median groove and apical pad bearing dermatoglyphs) in most species, but ventral prehensile surface reduced or absent in T. karimii and T. velutinus (Carmignotto and Monfort, 2006) .",

Character 76: Rostral and caudal tympanic processes of petrosal separated by a distinct gap (0); or in contact and separated by a suture (1); or indistinguishably fused (2). States 0 and 1 of this character represent the same pattern of ingroup variation that Voss and Jansa (2003: character 47) described in terms of concealment of the fenestra cochleae.

See text for a discussion of this character and its taxonomic distribution. Character 81: Stapes triangular and bicrurate, perforated by a large foramen (0); or stapes columelliform and microperforate or imperforate (1). See text for a discussion of this character and its taxonomic distribution. Although Schmelzle et al. (2005: character 12) scored Didelphis marsupialis as having a columelliform stapes, most of the specimens of D. marsupialis that we examined have a triangular stapes with a large foramen.

Character 85: Mandible usually with one mental foramen (0); or with two mental foramina (1); or with three mental foramina (2). This character differs from Voss and Jansa's (2003) character 50 by including a new state for the three mental foramina of Perameles gunni. See Jansa and Voss (2005) for a discussion of polymorphism in Hyladelphys, and the text of this report for information about outgroup variation.

The discovery of another condition (state 3) among the outgroup taxa of this study introduced another hypothetically intermediate condition between the absence of any accessory cusps and the presence of both anterior and posterior accessory cusps. Although this could be accommodated by a step matrix, we have also observed dentitions with indistinct anterior and posterior accessory cusps, suggesting that transitions between states 0 and 2 need not involve states 1 or 3 as intermediate stages.",

                "text": "Character 126: Robertsonian equivalents {acr1 + acr5, met1} present as a single metacentric chromosome (0); or as two acrocentric chromosomes (1). Most marsupials, including all of the outgroups in this analysis, have a diploid number (2n) of 14 chromosomes (Sharman, 1973; Hayman, 1977 Hayman, , 1990 Reig et al., 1977) , and this is also the most widespread number among didelphids (table 18) . By contrast, Glironia and Monodelphis have diploid counts of 18 chromosomes, whereas Chironectes, Didelphis, Lutreolina, Philander, and Tlacuatzin have 2n 5 22. Morphometric comparisons and G-banding studies indicate that each of these diploid groupings are homogeneous in the sense that different taxa with the same diploid number have chromosomes with essentially similar relative sizes, shapes (arm ratios), and banding patterns (Reig et al., 1977; Rofe and Hayman, 1985; Svartman and Vianna-Morgante, 1999) . By implication, a shared history of Robertsonian changes (centric fissions or centric fusions) could account for the taxonomic membership of each diploid category. A minimum of four centric fission/fusion events is required to account for the difference in diploid number between karyotypes with 14 chromosomes and those with 22 chromosomes. Based on arm homologies suggested by G-banding patterns, the following Robertsonian transformations involving eight acrocentric (acr) autosomes in the 2n 5 22 karyotype and four metacentric (met) autosomes in the 2n 5 14 karyotype are indicated (chromosomes are numbered from small to large within each karyotype): acr1 + acr5 \u00ab met1, acr2 + acr8 \u00ab met2, acr3 + acr10 \u00ab met3, and acr6 + acr9 \u00ab met4 (Svartman and Vianna-Morgante, 1999) . The 2n 5 18 karyotype is intermediate because it has only two metacentric autosomes, of which the larger can be homologized with acr2 + acr8 of the 2n 5 22 karyotype and with met2 of the 2n 5 14 karyotype, whereas the smaller metacentric can be homologized with acr6 + acr9 of the 2n 5 22 karyotype and with met4 of the 2n 5 14 karyotype (op. cit.). As explained by Voss and Jansa (2003: 42-44 ; see also Dobigny et al., 2004) , these transformational homologies are appropriately coded as separate characters, one for each set of Robertsonian equivalents-for example, {acr2 + acr8, met2}-which can exist in two states: fused (metacentric) or fissioned (acrocentric). Character 127: Robertsonian equivalents {acr2 + acr8, met2} present as a single metacentric chromosome (0); or as two acrocentric chromosomes (1).

The fact that conules have been scored as present and absent in the same taxon (e.g., Didelphis) by different authors (e.g.,Reig et al. [1987] versusWroe et al.

However, in another illustration (based on FMNH 22673; op. cit.:fig. 17b), M1 is correctly shown with a reduced stylar shelf labial to the paracone, and with a linear centrocrista. We borrowed FMNH 22671 to determine whether this specimen is unusual in any way and found that it is not: the paracone of M1 is almost on the labial margin of the tooth, and the centrocristae of M1-M3 are linear; therefore, Marshall's figure 16b is inaccurate.",

Character 11: Dorsal underfur dark (0); or white (1).Scoring criteria and information about the distribution of these traits among didelphid terminal taxa were provided by Voss and Jansa (2003: character 8) . See text for comments about traits expressed by outgroup taxa. Character 12: Dorsal pelage hairs not grossly dissimilar in length or coarseness (0); or dorsal pelage with guard hairs conspicuously longer and coarser than underfur (1); or dorsal pelage with stiff, dorsally grooved guard hairs (2). Scoring criteria and information about the distribution of states 0 and 1 among didelphid terminal taxa were provided by Voss and Jansa (2003: character 9) . See text for comments about traits expressed by outgroup taxa.In the absence of any compelling evidence for intermediacy among these alternative conditions, this character was treated as unordered in all of our analyses. Character 13: Externally conspicuous lateral carpal tubercles absent in both sexes (0); or large adult males with a prominent lateral carpal tubercle supported internally by the pisiform (1); or both sexes with a finger-like fleshy tubercle supported internally by the pisiform (2). This character is modified from Voss and Jansa's (2003: character 12) interpretation of pisiform-supported tubercular structures by including a third state for the unique condition seen in Chironectes. See text for comments about traits expressed by outgroup taxa. In the absence of any compelling evidence for intermediacy among these alternative conditions, this character was treated as unordered in all of our analyses. Character 14: Externally conspicuous medial carpal tubercles absent in both sexes (0); or large adult males with a prominent medial tubercle supported internally by the prepollex (1). Scoring criteria and information about the distribution of these traits among didelphid terminal taxa were provided by Voss and Jansa (2003: character 13) . See text for comments about traits expressed by outgroup taxa. Character 15: First manual digit (dI) large and clawbearing (0); or small and nail-bearing (1); or vestigial and lacking an unguis entirely (2). See text for a discussion of this character and its taxonomic distribution. Because state 1 can be plausibly interpreted as intermediate to states 0 and 2 in each case, both characters were treated as ordered (0 \u00ab 1 \u00ab 2) in all of our analyses. Character 16: Fifth manual digit (dV) large and clawbearing (0); or small and nail-bearing (1); or vestigial and without an unguis of any kind (2). See text for a discussion of this character and its taxonomic distribution. Although functional reduction in manual digits I and V covary among marsupials and might be coded together as a single character on the assumption that the transformations in question are developmentally or functionally dependent, dI and dV exhibit independent patterns of variation among placental mammals, suggesting that such changes are not necessarily linked. (All rodents, for example, have a reduced and clawless dI, whereas dV is typically large and claw-bearing.) Because state 1 can be plausibly interpreted as intermediate to states 0 and 2 in each case, both characters were treated as ordered (0 \u00ab 1 \u00ab 2) in all of our analyses. Character 17: Manual digit III longer than other manual digits (0); or dIII and dIV subequal and longer than other manual digits (1); or dIV longer than other manual digits (2). Scoring criteria and information about the distribution and ordering (0 \u00ab 1 \u00ab 2) of these traits among didelphid terminal taxa were provided by Voss and Jansa (2003: character 10) . See text for comments about traits expressed by outgroup taxa. Character 18: Manus with well-developed plantar pads (0); or manus without distinct plantar pads (1). See text for a discussion of this character and its taxonomic distribution. Character 19: Plantar pads of manus provided with dermatoglyphs (0); or manual plantar pads smooth (1); or plantar pads tuberculate 2. See text for a discussion of this character and its taxonomic distribution. This character was scored as inapplicable (''-'') for taxa lacking plantar pads (Chironectes and peramelids, see text). In the absence of any compelling evidence for intermediacy among these alternative conditions, this character was treated as unordered in all of our analyses. Character 20: Central palmar surface of manus smooth, or sparsely provided with large flattened tubercles (0); or densely covered with small convex tubercles (1); or entire plantar surface of manus sandpapery, covered with microscopically dentate tubercles (2).Scoring criteria and information about the distribution of these unordered traits among didelphid terminal taxa were provided by Voss and Jansa (2003: character 11) . See text for comments about traits expressed by outgroup taxa. Character 21: Hallux large and opposable (0); or very small and effectively nonopposable 1. See text for a discussion of this character and its taxonomic distribution. Character 22: Pedal digit III distinctly longer than digit IV (0); or pedal digits III and IV subequal (1); or pedal IV distinctly longer than III (2). Scoring criteria and information about the distribution and ordering (0 \u00ab 1 \u00ab 2) of these traits among didelphid terminal taxa were provided by Voss and Jansa (2003: character 14) . See text for comments about traits expressed by outgroup taxa. Character 23: Pedal digits free (0); or all pedal digits bound together by extensive fleshy webs (1); or pedal digits II and III fused (2). This character differs from Voss and Jansa's (2003) character 15 by including a separate state for the syndactylous hind feet of peramelids. In the absence of any compelling evidence for intermediacy among these alternative conditions, we treated this character as unordered in all of our analyses. Character 24: Claws on pedal digits II-V all alike (0); or claw on pedal digit II asymmetrically modified for grooming (1); or claws of pedal digits II and III asymmetrically and reciprocally modified for grooming (2). See text for a discussion of this character and its taxonomic distribution. Although state 2 is said to be correlated with syndactyly (Hall, 1987) , some syndactylous marsupials (e.g., Phascolarctos, Vombatus) do not have grooming claws (Putzkrallen) on dII and dIII, an observation that implies some degree of independence between claw function and digital fusion. In the absence of any compelling evidence for intermediacy among these alternative conditions, we treated this character as unordered in all of our analyses. Character 25: Plantar epithelium of tarsus macroscopically naked (0); or densely covered with coarse fur (1). Scoring criteria and information about the",

Among our outgroups, only Caenolestes, Dromiciops, and Perameles exhibit state 1. Character 41: Nasals produced anteriorly above or beyond I1, obscuring nasal orifice in dorsal view (0); or nasals posterior to I1, exposing nasal orifice dorsally (1); or nasals posterior to premaxillary facial processes, exposing incisive foramina in dorsal view (2). Scoring criteria and information about the distribution of states 0 and 1 among didelphid terminal taxa were provided by Voss and Jansa (2003: character 32) . See text for comments about traits expressed by outgroup taxa. Because state 1 is obviously intermediate to states 0 and 2, this character was treated as ordered (0 \u00ab 1 \u00ab 2) in all of our analyses. Character 42: Nasals extend posteriorly between lacrimals (0); or truncated anterior to lacrimals (1). Among the taxa examined for this study, nasals that are truncated anterior to the lacrimals (state 1) are peculiar to peramelemorphians (see text). Character 43: Nasals conspicuously wider posteriorly than anteriorly (0); or nasals uniformly narrow, their lateral margins subparallel (1). Scoring criteria and information about the distribution of these traits among didelphid terminals were provided by Voss and Jansa (2003: character 33) . Among our outgroups, only Echymipera and Perameles exhibit state 1. Character 44: Antorbital fenestra between nasal, frontal, and maxillary bones on each side of rostrum absent (0); or present (1). See text for a discussion of this character and its taxonomic distribution. Character 45: Maxilloturbinals large and elaborately branched (0); or small and unbranched (1). Scoring criteria and information about the distribution of these traits among didelphid terminals were provided by Voss and Jansa (2003: character 31) . See text for comments about traits expressed by outgroup taxa. Character 46: Maxillary-jugal suture straight, crescentic, or irregular (0); or suture deeply bifid, dividing jugal into dorsal and ventral processes flanking antorbital fossa (1). See text for a discussion of this character and its taxonomic distribution. Character 47: Distinct frontal process of jugal absent (0); or present (1). See text for a discussion of this character and its taxonomic distribution. Character 48: Lacrimal margin of orbit smoothly rounded (0); or forming a distinct crest (1). See text for a discussion of this character and its taxonomic distribution. Character 49: One lacrimal foramen usually present (0); or two lacrimal foramina usually present (1). See text for a discussion of this character and its taxonomic distribution.Character 50: Foramen rotundum laterally exposed behind sphenorbital fissure (0); or foramen rotundum concealed from lateral view, partly or wholly confluent with sphenorbital fissure in rear of orbit (1). See text for a discussion of this character and its taxonomic distribution. Character 51: Maxillary and alisphenoid separate (0); or in contact on orbital floor (1). Scoring criteria and information about the distribution of these traits among didelphid terminals were provided by Voss and Jansa (2003: character 43) . See text for comments about traits expressed by outgroup taxa. Character 52: Postorbital processes absent or indistinct (0); or present (1). This character was modified from Voss and Jansa's (2003) character 34 by eliminating our former distinction between ''flattened'' and ''not flattened'' postorbital processes, which are not consistently distinguishable among nondidelphid marsupials. See text for comments about traits expressed by outgroup taxa. Character 53: Postorbital processes formed by frontals only (0); or by frontals and parietals (1). In the context of this study, state 1 is an autapomorphy of Glironia (see text). Character 54: Left and right frontals separated by ontogenetically persistent median suture (0); or left and right frontals partially or completely co-ossified in adults 1. See text for a discussion of this character and its taxonomic distribution.

See text for comments about traits expressed by outgroup taxa. Character 57: Scars of M. temporalis origin on braincase not joined middorsally to form sagittal crest (0); or sagittal crest small, not extending to frontals (1); or sagittal crest large and extending to frontals (2). Descriptions of character states and an account of their taxonomic distribution among didelphid terminals were provided by Voss and Jansa (2003: character 35) , but an intermediate state between absence of a sagittal crest and presence of a large crest extending to the frontals is recognized here. See text for comments about traits expressed by outgroup taxa. Because state 1 is obviously intermediate to states 0 and 2, this character was treated as ordered (0 \u00ab 1 \u00ab 2) in all of our analyses. Character 58: Fenestra in squamosal-parietal suture absent (0); or present (1). This character is modified from its original formulation (Voss and Jansa, 2003: character 37) by eliminating an intermediate state for polymorphisms, which were recoded as 0/1 for this analysis.

Juveniles (with dP3/ dp3) and subadults (lacking dP3/dp3, but with incompletely erupted third premolars and/or fourth molars) may not key out accurately if they lack traits seen in conspecific adults (e.g., large size, postorbital processes, secondary foramina ovales, contact between left and right exoccipitals; . Although the following couplets are based, insofar as possible, on characters with unambiguously distinguishable alternative states, key results should always be checked by comparing specimens character-by-character against generic descriptions and cranial illustrations (figs. 37-54). Couplet 10, the only step in our key based on a single character, is obviously problematic if an atypical specimen is in hand. Users would be well advised, if an unsatisfactory result is obtained at any subsequent step, to follow the alternative sequence on the hypothesis that the species in question is polymorphic.External and craniodental measurements used to index size in this key are defined and abbreviated as follows: Head-and-Body Length (HBL) is obtained by subtracting length of tail from total length (Hall, 1981) ; Condylo-Basal Length (CBL) is measured from the occipital condyles to the anteriormost point of the premaxillae (Voss et al., 2004b: fig. 2 ); and Length of Molars (LM) is measured from the anteriormost labial margin of M1 to the posteriormost point on M4 (Voss et al., 2004b: fig. 2) tail longer than head-and-body; nasals distinctly wider posteriorly than anteriorly; maxillary fenestrae absent (except in Tlacuatzin); hypoconid labially salient on m3 (not lingual to protoconid) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 15 15a.
