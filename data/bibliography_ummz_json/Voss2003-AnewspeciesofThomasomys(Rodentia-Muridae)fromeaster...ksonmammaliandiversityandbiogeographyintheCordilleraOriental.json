    "abstract": "A new species of the murid rodent genus Thomasomys is described from the Cordillera Oriental of eastern Ecuador, a major range of the northern Andes that remains almost completely unexplored mammalogically. In order to provide a baseline for future faunal inventory work in these mountains, this report summarizes specimen data from the vicinity of Papallacta (0\u040a22\u0408S, 78\u040a08\u0408W), a small village located near tree line on the eastern (Amazonian) slope. In addition to the new Thomasomys, the local fauna includes 32 other species of nonvolant mammals, of which several (Akodon latebricola, Thomasomys cinnameus, and T. erro) have not been reported since their original descriptions in the 1920s. Taxonomic research based on this material indicates that at least six taxa currently treated as synonyms or subspecies should be recognized as valid species, including Thomasomys popayanus (possibly including T. nicefori) and T. praetor (both formerly synonymized with T. aureus), T. cinnameus and T. hudsoni (both formerly synonymized with T. gracilis), T. erro (formerly synonymized with T. cinereiventer), and Coendou quichua (formerly synonymized with C. bicolor). Although the Papallacta fauna includes several clades (''genera'') that extend to south-and north-temperate latitudes, over half of the local species are endemic to the northern Andes (north of the Huancabamba Deflection in northern Peru); among these northern-Andean endemics, three species known only from northeastern Ecuador provide evidence for a distinct center of endemism in the Cordillera Oriental. Quantitative estimates of species-level faunal complementarity indicate substantial horizontal turnover (between ecologically similar highland sites) on the scale of a few hundred kilometers, and almost complete vertical turnover (between adjacent highland and lowland sites) on the scale of about 2000 m. Both phenomena pose significant challenges for timely inventory work across vast Andean landscapes that remain sparsely sampled by mammalogists. In particular, the middle elevations of the eastern slope of the northern Andes, a densely forested region approximately 2 km high and over 1500 km long, remain a mammalogical terra incognita. 2003 41 VOSS: NEW THOMASOMYS derson, Marcela G\u00f3mez-Laverde, Mike Carleton, and Diego Tirira read the manuscript and offered helpful suggestions for its revision.

                "text": "Although the Cordillera Oriental (eastern Andes) of Ecuador was first traversed by Europeans in the sixteenth century, scientific knowledge of mammals from this region was not forthcoming until the late 1800s, when a small number of specimens began to arrive in European museums (de Winton, 1896; Cabrera, 1913 Cabrera, , 1917 . Throughout the first several decades of the 1900s, a period of active biological inventory elsewhere on the continent, only scattered collections amounting to just a few dozen specimens were made in the Cordillera Oriental. To date, no regional species lists or faunal descriptions of any kind have been published. This dearth of information is explained by the fact that only a few primitive trails formerly crossed the rugged eastern Andean escarpment, and those that did were frequently closed by landslides and other accidents. Even today, when allweather roads provide more-or-less reliable access along several routes, the Cordillera Oriental remains almost unexplored mammalogically. Steep, unstable slopes afford few places to camp, and the dripping-wet forests are miserable places to run traplines for more than a few days at a time. Most collecting expeditions to eastern Ecuador have hurried downslope to more inviting habitats in the Amazonian lowlands.",

Although these figures are not impressive by comparison with those from adjacent lowland sites that receive almost 4000 mm of rainfall annually (Ferndon, 1950) , Papallacta is persistently humid because it is shrouded in fog and mist for most of the year. Chapman's (1926: 29) inexplicable assignment of Papallacta to the ''Arid Division'' of his so-called Temperate Zone was not based on first-hand experience of this notoriously damp region. 2 Most of the mineral substrate surrounding Papallacta is igneous, consisting of lava, cinders, and ash from prehistoric eruptions of Antisana (0\u040a30\u0408S, 78\u040a08\u0408W; 5700 m), a nowdormant volcano that is one of the principal peaks of the Cordillera Oriental (see Sauer [1971: 16] for a brief technical account of the local geology). From the continental divide (about 4100 m; see appendix 1) to treeline the local landscape consists of rolling hillsides and rocky peaks dissected by narrow ravines or divided by broad flat-bottomed cirques (fig. 2) . The alpine vegetation of this p\u00e1ramo zone consists principally of wiry bunch grass (to 1 m high) on welldrained slopes ( fig. 3 ), but flat valley bottoms are marshy with pools of standing water and low hummocks of moss and other cushion-forming plants. Large terrestrial bromeliads (Puya) are scattered on open hillsides, but other kinds of large rosette plants that are common in Colombian and Venezuelan p\u00e1ramos are seldom seen. Almost pure stands of Polylepis (Rosaceae) occur as dense thickets whose canopies rarely exceeds 3-4 m. Within these nearly impenetrable tangles, limbs, trunks, and elevated root mats are covered with thick layers of cold, wet moss. Additional floristic, phenological, and anthropogenic aspects of local p\u00e1ramo habitats are described by Grubb (1960) , \u00d8llgaard and Balslev (1979) , Black (1982) , and Laegaard (1992) .",

TYPE MATERIAL: The holotype, UMMZ 155644 (skin, skull, and fluid-preserved carcass; original number RSV 660), is an adult male that I collected on 26 April 1980 at an elevation of 11,100 ft (3384 m) in the valley of the R\u00edo Papallacta (ca. 3-5 km by trail NNW Papallacta), Provincia Napo, Ecuador.",

Hairs over metapodials and digits of manus and pes dark, but tufts of longer hairs at bases of pedal claws silvery. Pes neither very narrow nor conspicuously broad; digit V long (its claw extending almost to base of claw of digit IV), but apparently nonopposable. Tail substantially longer than combined length of head and body, uniformly dark in most specimens but occasionally tipped with white; sparsely haired except for 5-10 mm terminal pencil. Mammae six in inguinal, abdominal, and postaxial pairs. Skull (in dorsal view) characterized by short, blunt rostrum flanked by shallow zygomatic notches; narrow, hourglass-shaped interorbit with rounded (not beaded or squared) margins; broadly flaring zygomatic arches; and large, oblong braincase unmarked by prominent temporal scars or lambdoidal ridges. Dorsal profile (in lateral view) distinctively flattened from nasal tips to midfrontal region; anterior margin of zygomatic plate straight and nearly vertical, not conspicuously sloping backward from base. Incisive foramina widest just behind premaxillary/maxillary suture and short (averaging 60% of diastemal length), not approaching first molar alveoli. Palatal bridge broad, smooth (without prominent ridges or grooves), and short (not extending posteriorly behind molar rows); posterolateral pits small, simple, inconspicuous perforations (never large, complex, or recessed in shallow fossae). Mesopterygoid fossa broad, straightsided, extending anteriorly between third molars; bony roof complete or perforated by narrow, slit-like sphenopalatine openings flanking the presphenoid/basisphenoid suture. Parapterygoid fossae narrow, approximately triangular, with shallow (unexcavated) anterior limits. Alisphenoid strut present, separating buccinator-masticatory from accessory oval foramina. Carotid circulation primitive (pattern 1), as indicated by large stapedial foramen, prominent squamosal-alisphenoid groove, and sphenofrontal foramen. Postglenoid foramen and subsquamosal fenestra subequal; tegmen tympani broadly overlaps posterior suspensory process of squamosal. Auditory bullae small, uninflated, flask-shaped; without sharply defined transition between capsular part and bony eustacian tube. Tympanic membrane pars flaccida present, large. Malleus with large orbicular apophysis.",

Because all of these traits are currently thought to be plesiomorphies within the Neotropical muroid radiation (Voss, 1993) , the genus lacks compelling evidence of monophyly. Pending a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the ''thomasomyine'' group, however, there is no more restricted taxonomic category within which to assess the relationships of T. ucucha. Phenetically, the new species most closely resembles T. hylophilus Osgood (1912) , an al-lopatric taxon that occurs in northeastern Colombia and western Venezuela. 3 Thomasomys ucucha and T. hylophilus overlap in all external and craniodental measurements (table 1), and they share many qualitative traits in common: both lack genal vibrissae but have moderately long mystacial hairs; relatively long tails; similarly proportioned hind feet; flattened fronto-nasal profiles; narrow interorbital regions with round-3 Specimens of Thomasomys hylophilus examined for this report include the holotype (FMNH 18583) together with 43 other specimens collected in or near the P\u00e1ramo de Tam\u00e1 on the border between Venezuela (Estado T\u00e1chira) and Colombia (Departamento Norte de Santander): AMNH 143667, 143668; FMNH 18563, 18565, 18566, 18576, 18580, 18584, 18587, 18591, 18593, 18595; USNM 259613, 442305, 442307-442311, 442313-442320, 442322-442331, 442336-442341. 2003 13 VOSS: NEW THOMASOMYS Fig. 8 .

In side-by-side comparisons, the contrast in upper incisor procumbency between the two species is visually obvious ( fig. 7 ), but measurements provide a more objective basis for discrimination. Measured with an ocular goniometer, the chord that subtends the exposed greater curvature of these teeth defines an average anterior angle of 87\u040a with the occlusal plane of the upper molars in ucucha (observed range, 85-89\u040a; N \u03ed 14), whereas the homologous angle has an average value of 77\u040a in hylophilus (observed range, 76-79\u040a; N \u03ed 11). 4 A correlated species difference in the lower incisors is likewise apparent: whereas the lower incisor root of ucucha is contained in a prominent capsular process on the lateral mandibular surface just below the base of the coronoid process ( fig. 8A ), the lower incisor root of hylophilus terminates in an inconspicuous bony ridge without a distinct process ( fig.  8B ).",

Correlated species differences in occlusal complexity are also apparent ( fig.  9 ). In the upper molars, the anterolophs and mesolophs of M1 and M2 are much more weakly developed in ucucha than in hylophilus, and M3 usually lacks a distinct lin- gual fold (hypoflexus) in ucucha that is consistently present in hylophilus. In the lower dention, the anteromedian flexid of m1 is shallower, less persistent with wear, or altogether absent in ucucha, whereas this fold is always present and usually persistent in hylophilus.",

Thomasomys ucucha is readily distinguished from other congeneric species known to occur in the Cordillera Oriental of northern Ecuador (T. aureus, T. baeops, T. cinnameus, T. erro, T. paramorum, T. rhoadsi, T. silvestris; see below) by numerous qualitative and quantitative character differences that are summarized in table 2. REMARKS: In a previous list of Papallacta mammals (Voss, 1988: table 43) , I referred to this taxon as ''Thomasomys sp.'' FIELD OBSERVATIONS: The 42 specimens of Thomasomys ucucha that I collected near Papallacta in 1978 and 1980 were trapped at elevations ranging from 3380 to 3720 m. Of these, 3 were taken in grassy p\u00e1ramo, 22 were taken in the shrubby p\u00e1ramo/forest ecotone or in grassy glades surrounded by forest, and 17 were taken deep inside Subalpine Rain Forest. Most recorded captures were on the ground, of which 18 were in rabbit trails or runways through dense grass or low herbs; 16 were in runways through moss or damp litter, under mossy debris, or at the bases of mossy trees; and 7 were along the wet margins of small streams. Only one specimen was trapped off the ground, on the mossy limb of a low tree. Other muroid species that were trapped syntopically (in the same habitats) with T. ucucha include Akodon latebricola, Akodon mollis, Anotomys leander, Chilomys instans, Microryzomys altissimus, M. minutus, Neusticomys monticolus, T. aureus, T. baeops, T. cinnameus, T. erro, and T. paramorum.",

However, measurements of these six specimens (from Papallacta and Guaman\u00ed) indicate that they have slightly narrower zygomatic plates and broader interorbits than typical montivagus, and side-by-side comparisons reveal that they have much less robust anterior unicuspids than any specimen of the type series (AMNH 47197-47201; from Besti\u00f3n, in the Ecuadorean province of Azuay).

A peculiar feature of AMNH 67506 is its intensely black fur, which is quite unlike the normal coloration of any other muroid rodent species known to me. Anthony (1924b) considered and rejected the hypothesis that the holotype was a melanistic mutant, but the rediscovery of this taxon at Papallacta lends support to the opposite conclusion.",

By contrast with the unnatural appearance of AMNH 67506, the Papallacta skins are dark grizzled-brown dorsally, and the ventral fur is gray-based with a superficial brownish wash; the ears, feet, and the dorsal surface of the tail are likewise dark brown, but the ventral surface of the tail is covered with long silvery hairs. Because brownish pigmentation is almost universal among the small akodontine rodents that inhabit humid Andean habitats, it is more parsimonious to assume that this is the normal coloration of Akodon latebricola, and that the coloration of the type is not, in point of fact, typical.",

Among other shared similarities, both species differ from typical Akodon by their very small size; possession of a slender, tapering rostrum flanked by very shallow zygomatic notches (versus a shorter, stouter rostrum flanked by deeper zygomatic notches); origin of the superficial masseter from an indistinct tubercle or scar on the anterior margin of the zygomatic plate (versus from a scar posteroventral to the anterior edge of the zygomatic plate); confluence of the buccinator-masticatory foramen and foramen ovale (versus buccinator masticatory foramen and foramen ovale accessorius separated by a vertical strut of the alisphenoid); proportionately shorter incisive foramina, wider parapterygoid fossae, and more inflated bullae; and highly distinctive molars with opposite (versus alternating) cusps. Although phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial DNA sequences do not support the separate generic status of Microxus (as represented by the type species mimus Thomas; see Smith and Patton [1993] and references cited therein), sequence data from latebricola and bogotensis have not been analyzed. Despite their current generic classification, these two northern-Andean endemics clearly form a distinct clade that merits nomenclatural recognition.

                "text": "FIELD OBSERVATIONS: The 21 specimens of Akodon latebricola that I collected near Papallacta in 1980 were trapped at elevations ranging from 3380 to 3840 m. Of these, 16 were taken in the shrubby p\u00e1ramo/forest ecotone, 2 in Subalpine Rain Forest, 2 in grassy glades surrounded by Subalpine Rain Forest, and 1 in grassy p\u00e1ramo. All recorded captures were on the ground: 9 in runways under dense bunch grass, 8 among mixed grasses and mossy shrubs, and 4 under moss mats or low herbs. Unlike other murid rodents that I collected near Papallacta (which appear to be strictly nocturnal), several individuals of A. latebricola were captured in broad daylight, between the time when traps were checked just after dawn and when they were rebaited in the late afternoon. TAXONOMY: The Papallacta material close-ly resembles the type of Akodon mollis altorum as originally described by Thomas (1913) based on a specimen collected at 2600 m in the Ecuadorean province of Ca\u00f1ar. No substantive analysis of character data, however, is available to support the current hypothesis (Cabrera, 1961; Musser and Carleton, 1993 ) that altorum, a highland taxon, is really conspecific with the geographically adjacent lowland forms mollis Thomas (1894) and fulvescens Hershkovitz (1940) . As noted by Myers and Patton (1989) , Akodon mollis as currently recognized has a very large geographic range and exhibits substantial geographic variation. Given their conclusion that fumeus Thomas (1902) -another taxon formerly ranked as a subspecies or synonym of mollis-is a valid species, a comprehensive revision of this complex is long overdue. FIELD OBSERVATIONS: The 16 specimens of Akodon mollis that I collected near Papallacta in 1980 were trapped at elevations ranging from 3600 to 4160 m. Of these, 13 were taken in the shrubby p\u00e1ramo/forest ecotone, and 3 in grassy p\u00e1ramo. All recorded captures were on the ground: 5 in tunnels among the bases of tall bunch grass, 5 among wet litter under mossy shrubs, 4 in runways through mixed bunch grass and bushes, 1 in a rabbit trail beneath low herbaceous cover, and 1 beneath an earth bank.",

Unfortunately, none can be effectively diagnosed by cranial characters, and meaningful pelage color comparisons are impossible with the alcohol-bleached material at hand. FIELD OBSERVATIONS: The specimen I collected in 1978 was trapped at an elevation of 3754 m next to a rocky stream bordered by grassy p\u00e1ramo vegetation.

Neither locality, however, is within the usual altitudinal range of this species (ca. 3000-4000 m), and the exact provenance of Fraser's Ecuadorean material is uncertain due to inadequate labelling and the lack of detailed field records (Gardner, 1983) . Despite the absence of cranial material and a definite geographic da-tum, however, the type serves to establish that aureus is a distinctively large, shaggy rat with grizzled yellowish-brown dorsal fur; yellow-washed, gray-based ventral fur; long, blackish mystacial vibrissae; dark, broad hind feet with semiopposable fifth digits; and NO. 3421 AMERICAN MUSEUM NOVITATES a tail that is much longer than the combined length of head-and-body. Other Ecuadorean specimens with these external characters exhibit the qualitative craniodental characters listed in table 2 and approximate the range of morphometric variation summarized in table 3.",

Other putatively synonymous taxa, however, differ conspicuously from aureus in side-byside morphological comparisons: popayanus Allen (1912) from the western Andes of Colombia and nicefori Thomas (1921) from the Colombian central Andes have substantially shorter (33-34 mm) hind feet and smaller (6.0 -6.6 mm) molar toothrows, whereas praetor Thomas (1900) from northern Peru has grayish dorsal fur, pale-silvery ventral fur, pale hind feet, shorter tail, narrower interorbit, and a broad, distinctively flattened braincase. These three taxa were first treated as conspecific with T. aureus by Cabrera (1961) , who (as usual) offered no explanation for his nomenclatural changes. In view of such trenchant character differences, at least four species appear to be represented in this complex: T. aureus (including altorum and princeps), T. praetor, and T. popayanus (possibly including nicefori).

Unlike any specimens of the other small species, the type of hudsoni (AMNH 47690, from Besti\u00f3n in Provincia Azuay) has a rostrum that is peculiarly produced beyond the incisors as a flaring bony tube with a concave (rather than convex) dorsal profile.

No noteworthy differences in pelage color or other external characters are apparent, however. The skull of AMNH 68195 is partially crushed, so only an incomplete set of measurements can be taken, but most of these fall within the range of variation observed among the Papallacta specimens; the exceptions are two molar dimensions in which the type is slightly larger (table 6). In all qualitative craniodental comparisons, the holotype appears to be indistinguishable from the Papallacta series and appears to represent the same taxon. Cabrera (1961) listed Thomasomys erro as a subspecies of T. cinereiventer Allen (1912) without explanation, and no discussion of character information has been published to justify the current treatment of erro as a junior synonym of that species (e.g., by Musser and Carleton, 1993) . However, side-by-side comparisons of the holotypes and other representative material of erro and cinereiventer do not support the hypothesis that these taxa are conspecific. Among other differences, typical cinereiventer from the Cordillera Oc-cidental of southern Colombia 7 is a much bigger animal with longer hind feet (33-36 mm); deeper zygomatic notches; less inflated interorbital region; more strongly convergent zygomatic arches; more elongate (less globular) braincase; broader and more vertically oriented zygomatic plates; consistently separate buccinator-masticatory and accessory oval foramina; larger (5.7-6.2 mm), incipiently lophodont molars with interpenetrating lingual and labial flexi (see illustrations and discussion of this trait in Voss, 1993) ; and relatively much broader incisors. Other In addition to the holotype of Thomasomys cinereiventer (AMNH 32436), I examined 17 paratypes (AMNH 32417, 32419, 32421-32425, 32427, 32428, 32430, 32433-32435, 32437-32440) , all of which were collected at 3152 m on the Pacific slope of the Cordillera Occidental west of Popay\u00e1n in Departamento Cauca, Colombia. Measurements (mm) and Weights (g) of Thomasomys erro ombian taxa that are currently considered to be subspecies or synonyms of T. cinereiventer-including contradictus Anthony (1925) from the Cordillera Central and dispar Anthony (1925) from the Cordillera Oriental-are smaller than the nominotypical form but do not exhibit any other noteworthy similarities with T. erro. FIELD OBSERVATIONS: I collected 17 specimens of Thomasomys erro in the vicinity of Papallacta, at elevations ranging from 2830 to 3570 m. Of these, 11 were taken in dense secondary vegetation, 5 in Subalpine Rain Forest, and 1 in Upper Montane Rain Forest. All recorded captures were on the ground. Eleven specimens were trapped in runways through wet leaf litter and mossy debris; three were trapped beneath mossy logs, branches, or roots; and one was trapped inside the trunk of a hollow tree.",

I compared the Antisana specimen with the type series, which it exactly resembles in qualitative characters. The Antisana specimen is an old adult, however, with molars that are worn below the widest part of the crowns, so most of its measurements are larger than those of adults with measurable teeth in the type series (table 9) .

By contrast, C. quichua is much smaller (ca. 600 mm or less) with a proportionately much shorter tail (approximately half the length of head-andbody) and tricolored (pale-tipped) dorsal quills that are not conspicuously longer over the forequarters than on the lower back and rump. Cranially, quichua has a proportionately narrower rostrum than bicolor, smaller orbits, less expanded jugals, and less inflated frontal sinuses.

As is typically the case when cumulative species richness is plotted against cumulative captures ( fig. 15) , new species were encountered at a relatively rapid rate early in the sampling process and at a relatively slow rate in the later stages. In fact, no new species were encountered among the last 102 trapped individuals. Be-NO. 3421 AMERICAN MUSEUM NOVITATES Fig. 15 . Species accumulation for small mammal trapping near Papallacta, where 16 species of caenolestid marsupials, shrews, and murid rodents were taken over 50 sampling days in 1978 and 1980 (see text) . The stepped appearance of the graph merits comment. Traps were first deployed along streams to capture ichthyomyines, where a total of 11 species were taken after 11 nights; 19 subsequent nights of streamside trapping more than doubled the number of recorded captures but yielded no additional species. The second increase in species richness resulted from moving traplines away from streams onto neighboring hillsides, where five more species were encountered. cause the traps I used are known to be effective for a wide range of species, and because I made a sustained effort to sample all recognizable macro-and microhabitats above 3000 m, these results suggest that few small (ca. \u03fd300 g) nonvolant species remain to be discovered here. Nevertheless, the fact that I did not trap some small species known to occur locally (e.g., Phyllotis haggardi) and the possibility that new species might occur in habitats that I was unable to sample effectively (e.g., p\u00e1ramo bogs, marshy lake shores, Upper Montane Rainforest) are compelling arguments for continued inventory efforts in the region.",

Also within these hypothetical limits, inter alia, are the Cordillera de los Llanganates (rising from the left bank of the upper Pastaza), the Cordillera El Diviso (including Volc\u00e1n Cayambe), the Cordillera de Pimampiro (northeast of Ibarra), and the P\u00e1ramos de las Juntas (east of Ipiales).

By contrast, carnivores, perissodactyls, artiodactyls, and murid rodents maintain almost equivalent diversity at both elevations. Caenolestid marsupials and insectivores are the only higher taxa present in the highlands but not in the lowlands.

From Tabl\u00f3n the trail ascended to another pass called Guaman\u00ed, about 5-6 km SW of the homonymous northern pass described above. This southern pass was described by Orton (1870) and Jim\u00e9nez de la Espada (1928) as a sharp ridge, as it is currently depicted on modern maps (near 0\u040a22\u0408S, 78\u040a14\u0408W) at an elevation of 4150 m (IGM, 1978b) . From this high point, the trail descended to a tambo (traditional resting place or shelter), probably the spot mapped as Hacienda El Tambo (ca. 0\u040a23\u0408S, 78\u040a12\u0408W) at 3780 m on the south bank of the R\u00edo Tambo ( fig. 1 ).

In order to better document the provenance of specimens examined for this report, I tried to locate every published first-hand description of this journey and the surrounding landscape. Apparently, two alternative routes were formerly used to cross the summit of the Cordillera Oriental and arrive at Papallacta. The following summary may prove helpful for other researchers working with old material from this region.The only published survey of a route from Quito to Baeza appears to be the stadia and planetable traverse in Sinclair (1929) . From the northeastern outskirts of Quito (0\u040a13\u0408S, 78\u040a30\u0408W) the road to Baeza passed through the towns of Guapulo (0\u040a12\u0408S, 78\u040a29\u0408W), Cumbay\u00e1 (0\u040a12\u0408S, 78\u040a26\u0408W), Tumbaco (0\u040a13\u0408S, 78\u040a24\u0408W), and Pifo (0\u040a14\u0408S, 78\u040a20\u0408W). A short distance beyond Pifo was an hacienda known as Paluguillo (0\u040a15\u0408S, 78\u040a18\u0408W), which was said to be the last permanently inhabited place before Papallacta was reached by this route (Sinclair, 1929; Moore, 1934) . Leaving Paluguillo (at 9452 ft [2881 m] according to Sinclair), the trail climbed ESE to the northernmost of the two passes referred to in the literature as Guaman\u00ed (ca. 0\u040a20\u0408S, 78\u040a12\u0408W). From this pass, a broad saddle at 4070 m, the road descended to a lake variously referred to as ''Sugchoscocha'' (Sinclair, 1929: 205) or ''Laguna de Sugchos'' (op. cit.: pl. 3); on modern maps (e.g., IGM, 1978b) it is labeled as ''Laguna Sucus''. The next prominent landscape feature along this route was Laguna Papallacta, from which the trail descended to the town itself ( fig. 1 ).",
