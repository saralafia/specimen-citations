    "abstract": "August and September, 1919, two short-tailed shrews (Blarina brevicauda) came about the tent frequently, and I was able to learn something of the habits of these usually rather elusive little mammals. They were active both by day and night. By day they avoided brightly lighted spots, traveling to the tent under the cover of dead leaves, herbs, and logs; and passing over open places like a flash. In the tent they kept mostly close to the side-walls, or to the pile of wood beside the stove. They were ceaselessly active, never resting for a moment unless engaged in eating something. They kept up a continual, rather musical, chirping squeak, which resembled very strongly the twitter oi'American goldfinches. This \"song\" of theirs was loud enough that we could hear them coming some time before they entered the tent. The Blarinas fed on insects, both living and dead. They caught and consumed all the crickets (Gryllu8 assimilis and Nemobius fasciatus) which previously had been common under the sod-cloth along the base of the walls of the tent,. and also devoured any dead insects which I had rejected after killing in t1,le cyanide bottle. On one occasion I saw one of them jump repeatedly at a sphinx larva which was suspended on a dead poplar twig a few inches above the ground, and at last succeed in pulling it down and into a tunnel in the dried grass. They ate with avidity anything of an animal nature, including pieces of salty chipped beef, and their particular delight was to get into the frying-pan and feed on the cold fat which it contained. So engrossed did they become in their gormandizing of this fat that they paid no heed to my presence and several times I took up the pan and walked about with it while they were thus engaged. They were not at all expert climbers and it was quite a feat for them to clamber over the high edge of the frying-pan. Once on top of the edge they tumbled in headfirst. In hunting for food they seemed to depend entirely on their sense of smell, and when thus prospecting they wriggled their long pink snouts continuously and inserted them into every nook and crevice. They appeared to use their eyes merely in avoiding well-lighted situations.-A",
