We first compared these with the body proportions of tree squirrels, in an attempt to gain a perspective on the basic adaptation of the Petauristinae for gliding. Second, we compared large flying squirrels with small ones. Among geometrically similar animals, weight should increase as the cube of a linear measurement, whereas the area of the patagium should increase as the square. Thus large fiying squirrels should have patagia that are more heavily loaded than those of small flying squirrels, and this should affect their ability to glide. We compared the body proportions of large and small petauristines to see if there were ways in which large fiying squirrels compensate for this allometric problem. \\Ve then used hang gliding as an analogue and attempted to determine what effect the allometric differenees have on the gliding of fiying squirrels.",

(1976) , Hills (978), Dodson (1978 ), Albrecht (1978 , and Atchley and Anderson (978). Some of the arguments are sufficiently obfuscating and intimidating to lead biologists to the conclusion that is is invalid statistically or at least unwise to use ratios under any circumstances. We disagree and would point to aerodynamics, which is sometimes called \"the science of coefficients and ratios.\" The main points made by Atchley et a1. 976and Atchley and Anderson (1978) are irrelevant to our study, because we did not study the correlations between ratios and we did not use ratios in multivariate analyses. The main question which may be raised is whether the ratios are normally distributed. This question was answered by examining the skewness and kurtosis of 45 representative ratios. One ratio was slightly skewed (P < 0.05) and none was significantly platykurtotic or leptokurtotic. None of our samples was large enough for a strong test of normality, but clearly the ratios did not differ from normal more than expected on the basis of chance. Accordingly, we submit that it is valid to use these ratios in interspecific comparisons, as we have done.",

Because the patagiulll is supported from the stylifonn cartilage at the wrist, it is possible for squirrels to evolve a wider membrane by growing a longer cartilage, independent of the length of the bones of the forelimb. We hypothesized that this was not an important factor. To test this, we measured the length of the cartilage (C) on one specimen each of 15 species of flying squirrels and regressed the data against the length of head and body (HB). This plot appears quite linear. The best fit of a power equiltion yields an <lllometric coefficient of 1.08, which is not significantly different from isometry. A linear equation (C = -7.35 + 0.25 HB) explains only 4% less of the variance, so we concluded that there was no disproportionate incr~ase in the length of the styliform cartilage of large flying squirrels compared with small ones. In another test of the hypothesis, we measured the styliform cartilages of 10 specimens each of seven species, ranging in size f!\"Om Petal/rilius kinlochii to Aerom!ls. The allometry coeHicient was 1.01, again suggesting isometry. Johnson-Murray (1977) found that the propatagia and plagiopatagia were equally well developed on small and large Hying squirrels, and we concur. However, as she pointed out, there is a significant difference in the size of the uropatagium of large and small Hying squirrels. On small flying squirrels the l\\l\"opatagium is virtually nonexistent and it certainly does not contribute signficantly to the area of the gliding memhrane. In the large flying squirrels Petallrista, Aerof1l!lS, and Aeretes, there is a significant uropatagium extending from the knee to the tail. This is one way in which the large flying squirrels seem to compensate for the increased loading of the gliding membrane. We attempted to quantify the increase in area, although we could not obtain very accurate measurements on museum skins.",

We have compared the body proportions of flying squirrels with those of tree squir~ reIs, because we think the morphology of tree squirrels is primitive aod the morphology of flying squirrels is derived. This hypothesis is based on two arguments. First, the earliest known sciurid, from the White River Formation of the Oligocene, has the body proportions of Recent tree squirrels (Emry and Thorington, pers. obs.).

It results in the higher ratio of lengths of radius to humerus and in the relatively longer forelimb, compared with length of trunk or hind limb, when Hying squirrels are compared with tree squirrels. These changes probably reflect some shape factors which are aerodynamically important. Photographs and tracings of flying squirrels show that the patagium is always wider in front than behind.",

                "text": "Flying squirrels do not scale with size the same way as tree squirrels, but in view of the allometric relationship between weight and the area of the patagium, it is perhaps surprising that scaling is so similar. Flying squirrels range in size (length of head and body) from less than 90 to more than 400 mm. An animal that is four times the length of another is expected to weigh approximately 64 times as much hut to have a patagium only 16 times as large. If geometrically similar, the largest flying squirrels should have patagia that are loaded four times as heavily as those of the smallest Hying squirrels. This shOlild have a significant effect on their gliding abilities. There are several ways in which flying squirrels could compensate for allometry. First, large Hying squirrels could be relatively thinner than small ones, or at le:.lst lighter than expected on the basis of their length. As shown in Tables 1 and 3 , this is so, and it is a way in which they scale differently than tree squirrels. The large Hying squirrels are proportionately 16% lighter than the small ones. Second, they could increase the area of the patagium disproportionately to the square of trunk length, as by developing relatively longer limbs. This they do not do (Table 4) , perhaps because it would compromise their climbing ability, or perhaps for aerodynamic reasons. Instead, the limbs of larger Hying squirrels are relatively shorter, as in tree squirrels, and the styliform cartilage is not lengthened to compensate. Therefore the area of the patagiu!l1 is approximately 10% less than predicted by isometry. Third, large flying squirrels could develop assessory gliding membranes. Petuurista, Aeromus, and Aerete~\u2022 have uropatagia that increase the area up to 5%. Summing these three [letors, we expect large flying squirrels to have a patagial loading of approximately 90% that predicted hy isometry; still, this amounts to a loading .'360% that of small flying squirrels. Our measurements (Tahles 8 and 9) seem to corroborate this and to demonstrate that large Hying squirrels have a patagium loading three to four times that of the sIHali ones.",

                "text": "For a hang glider, and presumably for flying squirrels, wing loading per se does not affect the ratio of lift to drag, and hence it has no effect on the glide ratio (Markowski, 1977:283) . It does affect the speed at which a glider must travel if it is to maximize the glide ratio. Because the speed is proportional to the square root of wing loading, a flying squirrel with a patagium loading four times that of another presumably must glide twice as fast to maximize the distance of its glide. This proportionality will be mitigated a bit because large flying squirrels glide at higher Reynolds numbers than small ones and this will reduce drag slightly. The optimal gliding speed is proportional to the fourth root of the inverse of the coefficient of drag at zero lift, so wing loading should be the dominant factor. For hang gliders, a wing loading of 50 N/m~ is recommended for all-around performance. At lower wing loadings, the glider is too vulnerable to gusts of wind and air turbulence; it does not \"penetrate\" the air well. At higher wing loadings, the pilot must fly faster to maximize his glide ratio, and this leaves less time to react and steer. It is striking that the patagillm loading of most flying squirrels is close to that recommended for hang gliding. Judging from the analogy, we suggest that the most lightly loaded flying squirrels are best adapted to gliding in forested areas where there is little turbulence and where slow flight speed and high maneuverability are important. A flying sqnirrel with a more heavily loaded patagium may be better adapted to more open areas, where air turbulence is more of a problem and maneuverability is les5 of one.",

Accordingly, it would seem desirable that flying squirrels have long forelimbs for support of a wide patagium. A5 demonstrated, they do have long forelimbs relative to those of tree squirrels, but Hying squirrels have very low aspect ratios compared to bats, as discussed below, and to birds. Our data are not adequate to illustrate how the aspect ratio varies among flying squirrels, but the measurements of the lengths of forelimbs suggest that the aspect ratios of small flying squirrels average higher than those of large Hying squirrels. The uropatagium of large flying squirrels must also reduce the aspect ratio, which seems anomalous. Curiously, Eoglaucomys probably has the lowest aspect ratio of any Hying squirrel (Table 9 ). This seemed remarkable to us for a species that lives at 3,000 m elevation, where the air is much less dense and provides le5s lift than near sea level where most flying squirrels occur.",

Tests with rectangular airfOils of low aspect ratio provide a tentative explanation. Zimmerman (1932) found that airfoil5 with aspect ratios near 1.0 do not stall until a high attack angle is reached. Maximum lift coefficients and maximum resultant force coefficients increased as aspect ratio decrca5ed in the range from 3 to 1. He argued that thi5 would affect landing characteristics favorably by reducing landing speed. He also demonstrated that low aspect wings have moment characteristics more favorable to stability. Accordingly, it seems likely that Aying squirrels with low aspect ratios are gaining stability and lowering landing speeds at the cost of reducing their glide ratios slightly. Zimmerman's (1932) study also demonstrated that the tip shape of the wing greatly affects airfoil characteristics at low aspect ratios. Semicircular tips were much superior to rectangular tips. We have been unable to treat this hwtor in flying squirrels thus far, because tip shape (as well as the sweepback angle of the \"wing\") appears to be under dynamic control (see illustrations in Walker, 1947 and Rue, 1967; Hoffmeister and 1'\\'10hr, 1972; and Welch and Welch, 1979) .

As billowing is increased, the lift and drag coefficients are increased and air speed can be decreased, but at the cost of a decreasing glide ratio. Photographs suggest that flying squirrels can control the amount of billow in their patagia (Hoffmeister and Mohr, 1972:fig. 84 ). The alignment of the muscles humerodorsalis I and III (Johnson-Murray, 1977) would permit their use as battens to reduce billow, and by reducing billow the squirrels should he able to lengthen the glide.

We have observed Glallcomys volans in Maryland and have estimated a glide ratio between 2 and 3. Walker (1975) cited a 50-m glide with an IS-m drop: a glide ratio of2.8. In Japan we observed Petaurista lellcogen1j8 gliding between tall Cryptomeria trees at approximately a 45\u00b0 angle, which is a glide ratio of 1.0. Similarly, Peter S. Rodman (pers. comm.) ob!;erved Petaurista petaurista in the Kutai Nature Reserve, East Kalimantan, Indonesia, gliding approximately 150 m with an equal drop. Davis (1962) reported a Petaurista in Sabah, Borneo, gliding 100 m with a corresponding drop of perhaps 35 m, which is a glide ratio of almost 3. IlIar MUlil (pers. comm.) has seen Petaurista glide 300 m from a limestone bluffto the tops of fruit trees while dropping approximately 125 m, which is a glide ratio of 2.4 (Muul also estimated the longest glide he has seen to he 400 m). From these estimates, we hypothesize that the maximal glide ratio of Hying !;qtlirrels is on the order of .3, and that the ratio does not differ greatly from small to large squirrels. The initial part of the glide is steep and prohahly represents the period of time when the squirrel is reaching optimal velodty for gliding. Having reached this velocity, the squirrel is ahle to Ratten out its glide to maximize the horizontal distance covered. At the end of the flight, it increases the angle of attack, which may cause it to swoop upwards before landing. There are varying reports about how hard f:lying squirrels land, but velocity at impact is probahly under voluntary controL From our observations and readings we suspect that they can go into a \"mush\" or semistall for a hard but fast landing; they can reduce air speed by swooping upward at the end of a flight for a soft precise landing; Of they can execute a parachute landing in emergencies. Pho-tographs of landings may be found in Walker (1947:662-666) , Doutt et al. (1966:127) , Rue (1967:90), and Lawrence (1974:45) .",

If we assume that the coeflicient of lift is LO, a more reasonable value, then a G. volans of average size must glide at a speed of 8.4 m/s (19 mph.) to maintain a glide ratio of 3: 1 or at 8.2 m/sec (18 mph) for a glide ratio of2:1.

Large flying squirrels do not have relatively longer limbs to increase wing area and thus decrease wing loading. The major aerodynamic implication of the heavier wing loadings of large flying squirrels is that they must glide faster than small squirrels with lower wing loadings. We interpret some of the morphological specializations oflarge flying squirrels, such as the short forelimbs of EoglallcoJn!IS and the uropatagiulIl of Petaurista and AeroJnYs, as aerodynamic adaptations that lead to better landing characteristics, mostly by reducing landing speed. These specializations may reflect compromises hetween conflicting selective forces for increasing glide ratios and for maintaining safe gliding and landing speeds.",
