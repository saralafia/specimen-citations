    "abstract": "Otopteropus cartilagonodus (Megachiroptera, Pteropodidae) is a rare, small-bodied cynopterine bat endemic to Luzon Island in the Philippine Archipelago. Twenty-two female and seven male O. cartilagonodus were collected during March and May of 1988. Observations were made on early embryonic development and the morphology of ovaries, uteri, and testes. All females collected during March were pregnant, and their uterine swellings occurred within a narrow size range (2-4 mm in diameter). Moreover, the embryos of all eight females captured in March and examined histologically were all within or just before the primitivestreak stage of development. The uterine swellings of females captured in May ranged from 15 to 20 mm in diameter, and their extrapolated birth dates were in late Mayor June. The synchrony of embryologic development and the apparent lack of developmental progress during March suggests that O. cartilagonodus has a prolonged period at the primitive-streak stage of embryonic development. The morphology of the embryo, embryonic membranes, and uterus at these stages is similar to that of two other cynopterine fruit bats, Cynopterus sphinx and Hap/onycteris fischeri.",

                "text": "Patterns of reproductive timing and embryonic development of Old World fruit bats (Megachiroptera) are poorly known relative to those of other mammals (Gopalakrishna and Karim, 1979; Mossman, 1987; Racey, 1982; Rasweiler, 1979) . Pathways of embryonic development in bats are as diverse as those of all other mammals combined; nonetheless, reproduction has been described in so few genera of bats that broad patterns are uncertain (Mossman, 1987) . The reproductive biology of certain megachiropterans is particularly interesting because of unusual adaptations that extend the period between implantation and parturition. Krishna and Dominic (1983) presented evidence for either delayed implantation or post-implantational delayed development in a small cynopterine fruit bat, Cy-nopterus sphinx, from India. Heideman (1988, 1989) described an eight-month delay in post-implantation development in another small cynopterine fruit bat, Haplonyeteris fiseheri, from the Philippines. In contrast to delays before implantation, postimplantation delayed embryonic development is rare in mammals, having been welldescribed only in five species in four families of bats; Macrotus californicus (Phyllostomidae-Bradshaw, 1962) , Artibeus jamaicensis (Phyllostomidae-Fleming, 1971) , Pipistrellus pipistrellus (Vespertilionidae- Racey and Swift, 1981) , Hippasideros caffer (Hipposideridae-Bernard and Meester, 1982) , and Haplanycteris fischeri (Pteropodidae-Heideman, 1989 ). Post-implantation delayed development also has been implicated, although not definitively dem-onstrated, in two species of two other families of bats; Taphozous longimanus (Emballonuridae- Krishna and Dominic, 1982) and Rhinolophus rauxi (Rhino10phidae- Ramakrishna and Rao, 1977) . With the exception of the two cynopterines, these species are distantly related, suggesting that delayed development has arisen independently a number of times within the Chiroptera. In contrast, the two cynopterines may have inherited delays in embryonic development from a common ancestor. Thus, comparative studies within this group and its relatives might provide insight into the evolution of these delays.",

Reproductive status was recorded for each of the 22 females and five of the seven males captured. Lactational status was noted and autopsies were performed to determine the presence and size of embryos. The greatest diameter of each uterine swelling was measured with a ruler. Three male and 14 female specimens were fixed in formalin for 2-4 weeks and later transferred to 70% ethanol. The remaining specimens were preserved as museum skins and skeletons. Reproductive tracts of eight of the fluid-preserved females and the right testis and epididymis from two of the fluid-preserved males captured 5-27 March were removed, dehydrated in a graded ethanol series, embedded in paraplast, and serially sectioned in a transverse or sagittal plane at 5-1 0 ~m. Sections were mounted on glass slides and stained with hematoxylin and periodic-acid-Schiff's reagent (Humason, 1972) . In general, developmental terminology follows Mossman (1987) . Specimens are deposited at the United States National Museum of Natural History, the Field Museum of Natural History, the Philippine National Museum (Manila), and Silliman University (Dumaguete City, Philippines).",

The lack oflactating females and the absence of juveniles or suhadults in the samples suggests that no young had been born in the previous 6-1 0 months, as juvenile and subadult cynopterine fruit bats can be distinguished on the basis of pelage color and fusion of the phalangeal epiphyses until ca. 6-10 months in age (Heideman, 1987 (Heideman, ,1989 Heideman and Heaney, 1989) . Thus, offspring from a second mating in June or July presumably would, in March, still display the typical characteristics of young bats. Although capture bias may explain the lack of subadults and lactating females in the samples, subadults and lactating females o f other megachiropterans generally are easy to ca pture in mist nets (Heideman, 1989; Heideman and Heaney, 1989) . Thus, our data suggest that females in this population produce one young each year in late May, June, or early July. The only previous reproductive records for O. cartilagonodus are for two females from northern Luzon (Mudar and Allen, 1986) . Our examination of these specimens (UMMZ 156689 and 15 6972) indicates that the former actually is H. fischeri and the latter, captured 30 April 1981, carried a 15-mm embryo, comparable in size to those in our study from 5-6 May 1988.",

                "text": "Two features of our data are surprising and suggest that O. cartilagonodus may undergo a developmental delay. First, an unusually high degree of synchrony was observed in the developmental stages of the embryos. All female bats collected during the month of March contained uterine swellings within a narrow size range (2-4 mm). Moreover, the embryos of all those examined histologically were just before or within the primitive-streak stage of embryogenesis. Populations of bats, including those that reproduce synchronously and seasonally, typically show a much lower degree of synchrony during early development (e.g., Baker and Baker, 1936; Marshall, 1947; Mutere, 1965; Myers, 1977; Rasweiler, 1977 Rasweiler, , 1982 Sandhu, 1984) than does our March sample. A high degree of developmental synchrony often is associated with some form of delay during pregnancy (Bleier, 1975; Bradshaw, 1962; Fleming, 1971; Heideman, 1989; Krishna and Dominic, 1983) . Second, only slight growth or developmental progress occurred during March. That all eight examined embryos were just before or within the primitive-streak stage of embryogenesis implies that this stage may be prolonged in Otopteropus, assuming that the sample was representative of the population. The developmental stages observed in March correspond to those of H. fischeri during the last 2 months of their 8-month developmental delay (Heideman, 1989) . Thus, March may be the end of a period of developmental delay in Otopteropus. This hypothesis is consistent with observations of males. We would predict that recently breeding males might have abundant spermatozoa, but the reproductive tracts of males captured in March were small and had f~w or no spermatozoa, even though developing spermatocytes were abundant. Conclusive evidence for or against devel-opmental delay requires samples from a longer span of months.",

These three species are similar in the persistence of collapsed zonae pellucidae embedded within ovarian stroma, appearance of the trophoblast, structure of the embryoblast and the embryonic disk, formation of the proamniotic cavity, and appearance and migration of mesoderm. These three species also may share a tendency to prolong the period just before or after implantation. Two of these species, O. cartilagonodus and H. fischeri, are closely related members of an endemic Philippine radiation of small cynopterine fruit bats (Heaney and Rickart, 1990) . Although some form of delay in development may have evolved independently in these species, it is possible that a period of slowed embryonic development evolved only once in a common ancestor, and may have been inherited (and possibly modified) by other members of this Philippine clade. More detailed study of early embryonic development and its regulation in these and related species might help explain the evolution of delayed embryonic development.",
