    "abstract": "Differences in jaw function experienced through ontogeny can have striking consequences for evolutionary outcomes, as has been suggested for the major clades of mammals. By contrast to placentals, marsupial newborns have an accelerated development of the head and forelimbs, allowing them to crawl to the mother's teats to suckle within just a few weeks of conception. The different functional requirements that marsupial newborns experience in early postnatal development have been hypothesized to have constrained their morphological diversification relative to placentals. Here, we test whether marsupials have a lower ecomorphological diversity and rate of evolution in comparison with placentals, focusing specifically on their jaws. To do so, a geometric morphometric approach was used to characterize jaw shape for 151 living and extinct species of mammals spanning a wide phylogenetic, developmental and functional diversity. Our results demonstrate that jaw shape is significantly influenced by both reproductive mode and diet, with substantial ecomorphological convergence between metatherians and eutherians. However, metatherians have markedly lower disparity and rate of mandible shape evolution than observed for eutherians. Thus, despite their ecomorphological diversity and numerous convergences with eutherians, the evolution of the jaw in metatherians appears to be strongly constrained by their specialized reproductive biology.",

                "text": "In mammals, differences in mode of reproduction and developmental timing between placentals (e.g. cats, pangolins, rats and humans) and marsupials (e.g. kangaroos, Tasmanian devils and opossums) have been hypothesized to drive their disparate evolutionary histories [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Marsupials in general have a unique reproductive mode with an extremely short period of internal gestation of the fetus inside the mother (see [10] for exception). As a result of this accelerated gestation, marsupials give birth to neonates in an embryonic condition, which then need to travel from the birth canal powered by their forelimbs, in order to attach to the mother's teat to suckle [11] . Because of these early functional requirements, the morphology of newly born marsupials is a mosaic of structures that develop early (such as the forelimb [7, 8, 12, 13] and oral apparatus [14, 15] ) and late (such as the hind limbs and braincase [8, 12, 13, 16] ). Consequently, the functional requirements imposed by this distinctive reproductive mode may have constrained the evolution of marsupials and cause their relatively low diversity and reduced morphological variation (i.e. disparity) in comparison to placentals [5, 6] . This hypothesis has been extensively debated in the literature, and previous authors have found contrasting results [7, 12, 13, [16] [17] [18] [19] . Furthermore, some studies have argued that other factors may have impacted mammalian evolution, such as historical biogeographic distributions [18] . By contrast to placentals, marsupials and their extinct relatives currently occupy a smaller terrestrial surface with less diverse types of environments and, might have had fewer opportunities to adapt to different ecological contexts [18] .",

A handful of studies have included a broad sample of placental and marsupial mammals [8, 16, 19] , and focused on the limb elements [7, 12, 16, 22, 23] or the skull, but none have focused on the morphological evolution of the jaw, the one structure that is uniformly and unambiguously functioning in neonatal marsupials. Whereas some marsupials do not crawl to the mother's teat (and thus do not require functional forelimbs at birth) [24] , and the skull has multiple functions in sensory and nervous systems, the jaw has one clear primary purpose, for feeding, and serves this function immediately after birth in all marsupial neonates. More broadly, previous studies of jaw morphology routinely use operational taxonomic unit and diversity scoring [25] or linear data [26] , but the marsupial jaw, in particular, involves unusual processes (e.g. the inflected angular) that require a three-dimensional approach.",

To do so, we reconstruct the evolution of jaw shape and quantify the relative influences of reproductive mode and function (diet) on its morphology. If functional constraints experienced during early development have indeed limited the evolution of the jaw in metatherians, we predict that mandible disparity and rate of evolution should be lower and slower in metatherians than in eutherians.",

All information about the specimens and the definition of their dietary and reproductive mode came from the literature (see electronic supplementary material, table S1), especially for extinct taxa. Note that it is assumed in this study that all eutherians give birth to more developed newborns (from altricial to precocial) whereas all metatherians give birth to less-developed newborns (highly altricial). Furthermore, we consider that all metatherians share the reproductive mode observed in extant marsupials, although this is ambiguous for stem taxa (e.g. borhyaenids).

In order to transform the curve semilandmarks into geometrically homologous points, a three-dimensional sliding semilandmark procedure [30, 31] was performed following the protocol described in previous studies [4, [32] [33] [34] . In order to slide all of the curve semilandmarks while minimizing bending energy, we used the 'slider3d' function from the Morpho R package [35, 36] .

To do so, we used, respectively, the functions 'gm.prcomp' from the R geomorph package [37] , and 'phyl.pca' and 'phylomorphospace' from the R phytools package [39, 40] . Next, we tested for shape differences between infraclass and diet using a type II phylogenetic multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) in R mvMORPH package [41] . The multivariate phylogenetic linear models were fitted with a Pagel's lambda by penalized likelihood using the 'mvgls' function [41] . Pagel's lambda has the advantage to provide increased flexibility in estimating the error structure and it is equivalent to fitting a phylogenetic mixed model while accounting for departure from Brownian motion (BMM) [41] [42] [43] [44] . Subsequently, this model was used as input in the 'manova.gls' function (electronic supplementary material, table S4). The significance of each type II phylogenetic MANOVA was assessed using a Pillai statistic and 1000 permutations. Finally, to identify morphological convergence depending on diet and infraclass, we used the phylogenetic ridge regression method of the RRphylo package in R [45] . We first performed a phylogenetic ridge regression on the tree and with the first 24 PC scores (accounting for 95% of the overall variance) using the 'RRphylo' function in order to obtain the branch-wise evolutionary rates and the ancestral character estimates at nodes. Next, we establish morphological convergence for each diet category using the 'search.conv' function under 'state' cases on PC scores. From these analyses, we retrieve the mean angle (mean angle between species within the dietary category), and the p of the mean angle (significance level for mean angle) [45] .",

Shifts in the rate of continuous trait evolution (modelled by a BMM process) were detected using a reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. The phylogenetic principal components (PCs) accounting for 95% of the overall variation in jaw shape were used as input (i.e. the first 33 phylogenetic PCs for the entire dataset and the first 32 for the extant dataset). Ten independent chains were run for 200 000 000 iterations, sampling every 10 000 iterations and the first 25 000 000 iterations were discarded as burnin. Trace plots were examined and two independent chains that were stationary after burn-in were kept. We assessed the effective sample size (ESS) of the posterior samples (ESS > 100) as well as the convergence of the chains, with a Gelman and Rubin's convergence diagnostic, using, respectively, the functions 'effectiveSize' and 'Gelman.diag' implemented in the R coda package (see electronic supplementary material, figures S2, S3 and tables S4-S7).

Changes in jaw function experienced during ontogeny may impose or release developmental constraints, with consequences for morphological variation and, ultimately, evolutionary diversity. The three subclasses of mammals show major differences in reproductive strategy, from the species-poor, egg-laying monotremes, to marsupials and placentals. Assessing the impact of these reproductive strategies on the divergent evolutionary histories of these clades requires an assessment of shape evolution in a representative sample of modern and fossil species, as conducted in the limb and cranial skeletons [7, 22, [48] [49] [50] . Here, we advance this work with the first study investigating how the marsupial reproductive strategy has impacted the evolution of the jaw, using a diverse sample of modern and fossils species with a range of ecologies for both eutherians and metatherians. Because the jaw has one primary purpose and is uniformly functional immediately after birth in all marsupials, it is arguably one of the best bony elements for assessing the impact of the marsupial reproductive strategy on the evolution of morphological diversity on this clade. Our results unambiguously support the prediction that early suckling and related accelerated development of the jaw constrains its evolution in metatherians. Specifically, our results demonstrate that metatherian mandibles have a lower disparity and slower rate of evolution in comparison to eutherians.",

Prior investigations of adult skull disparity [48, 50] and ontogenetic trajectories of skull shape change [48] demonstrated that metatherians have significantly less disparity and more aligned ontogenetic trajectories than eutherians in the early-ossifying oral region of the skull, but not in the late-ossifying neurocranial region, supporting the hypothesis that suckling function constrains the development and evolution of the oral components of the skull. Several previous studies of postcranial elements (forelimb and hind limb) using adult and ontogenetic data marsupials and placentals found strong support for constraints in metatherian morphological evolution at the macroevolutionary [7] and microevolutionary scales [22, 23, 51] , including comparing ontogenetic trajectories of forelimb shape [7] . Only one quantitative analysis to date [12] has concluded that limb evolution in marsupials may not be constrained by development. However, that study investigated this hypothesis using only marsupials and qualitatively compared their results to those from other studies of placentals, rather than directly comparing data from both clades [12] . Analyses of disparity and rate of evolution are difficult to compare across studies, particularly when there are differences in data types and samples. Consequently, the results obtained for one dataset (e.g. marsupials) in one study may not be directly comparable to those from another study with non-overlapping samples (e.g. placentals) royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rspb Proc.

In addition, comparisons only within marsupials [12] cannot fully test for developmental constraints due to the marsupial reproductive strategy because they lack an appropriate baseline. To assess whether or not the marsupial developmental strategy constrains the evolution of specific structures that are functionally engaged early in postnatal ontogeny, the appropriate comparison is not between different structures within the marsupial skeleton, which can differ extensively in shape, function and disparity for many reasons, but with disparity of the same structure in taxa that do not have that developmental constraint (i.e. placentals [20] ). Our shape analyses demonstrate that metatherians occupy the same parts of jaw morphospace as eutherians. However, they highlight that metatherians occupy a smaller area of that morphospace compared to eutherians. Moreover, our results showed that metatherians never invade some parts of the eutherian morphospace, such as Artiodactyla, Rodentia and part of the primate morphospace, even if both groups display the same range of terrestrial ecological diversity. Nonetheless, our pMANOVA analyses did not find any overall differences in jaw shape between metatherians and eutherians, suggesting extensive convergence across both clades between species with similar diets. In support of this result, it is evident in the morphospace that some species with similar diets or similar biomechanical requirements occupy the same parts of the morphospace (figures 1 and 2) . For example, the first PC axis differentiates species using lingual feeding (nectarivorous royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rspb Proc. R. Soc. B 288: 20210319",

It is interesting to note that the most striking morphological feature used in the literature to distinguish the marsupial jaw from the placental one is the medially inflected angular process. Surprisingly, this morphological feature does not appear to clearly separate marsupials from placentals in the morphospace. Thus, it seems that diet specializations are a more important driver of jaw shape difference in mammals, particularly the difference between species eating soft food in comparison to those eating hard food. Several of these convergences are illustrated in figures 1 and 2, lingual feeders such as termite-eating specialists southern tamandua (Tamandua tetradactyla), numbat (Myrmecobius fasciatus) and pangolin (Manis javanica) fall in the same part of the morphospace as the nectarivorous honey possum (Tarsipes rostratus). Jaw shape convergence between metatherians and eutherians are also observed in carnivorous species such as the thylacine (Thylacine cynocephalus) and the wolf (Canis lupus), and the water opossum (Chironectes minimus) and the giant otter shrew (Potamogale velox). Similarly, insectivorous adaptations drive similar jaw shapes in species such as the eutherian star-nosed mole (Condylura cristata) and the marsupial mole (Notoryctes typhlops), the aye-aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis) and the striped possum (Dactylopsila trivirgata), as well as the montane shrew (Sorex monticolus) and the shrew opossum (Caenolestes fuliginosus). Other notable examples displaying similar jaw shapes are browsers such as the black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis) and the rhinoceros-sized wombat (Diprotodon optatum), as well as the two-toed sloth (Choloepus hoffmanni) and the bear cuscus (Ailurops ursinus). These results support previous ecomorphological studies on the convergence between marsupials and placentals (e.g. [52, 53] ). However, they also demonstrate that these convergences occurred only in a small part of the morphospace and in some dietary groups, as demonstrated by the convergence analyses which are significant in lingual feeder, carnivore, omnivore, browser, tuberivore, grazer and insectivore species. Combined, these results suggest that the morphological evolution of the metatherian jaw is developmentally constrained, relative to eutherians. Moreover, it is interesting to note that metatherians and eutherians overlapped and have no significant jaw shape difference as suggested by the results of the PCA and the phylogenetic MANOVA whereas they show a significant difference in disparity and rate of evolution. These results tend to indicate that the shape variation and rate evolution between both mammalian groups seems to be the main driver of their evolutionary difference rather than their actual shape difference itself. Therefore, this study provides new insights concerning the impact of the developmental timing on the pattern of morphological evolution in mammals and confirms that development can be a major driver or constraint of morphological evolution across major lineages, even within clades that are entirely viviparous.",
