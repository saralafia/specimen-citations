Furthermore, it is well known that the same observer will unconsciousl y use a different grading for each different. kind of animal. For instance, the wolf might be ranked as \"abundant\" when it was far less numerous per square mile than the chipmunk ranked as \"few\" or \"rare.\" A method of stating abundance of small mammals in terms of \"trapnights\" was at one time suggested by Grinnell.' The total number of traps set in each habitat is multiplied by the number of nights they are set. But there are several difficulties in the use of \"trap-nights\" as units: All mammalogis ts are not equally skilled in the setting of traps; the distance the traps are set apart varies; the weather conditions undoubtedly influence the activity of the animal and therefore the number coming in contact with the traps; the several makes of traps vary in their effectiveness for the different kinds of mammals; the traps themselves vary in efficiency depending on their previous use and exposure to the weather; and the number of animals caught usually decreases each night the trap-line is set.",

For best results 25 to 100 quadrats should be counted. If a species occurs in all the quadrats it has a frequence of 100 per cent; if in only one quadrat out of 25 it has only 4 per cent frequence. The quadrats can be of any uniform size large enough to contain a good sample of the flora or fauna of the habitat.

This study was made for the Michigan Department of Conservation and in the northern peninsula of Michigan. The period of field observation extended from August 21to 29, 1927. I drove in an automobile over the main highways of the peninsula, stopping every 10 to 30 miles, wherever the cover seemed suitable for these animals, and examining the area immediately adjacent to the road for the characteristic pellets. and runways of the hares. As no other species of rabbit or hare occurs in the region there was no danger of confusion with any other form. Altogether 37 places were examined, and of these 33 yielded fresh signs of the presence of the animal. This would be a percentage of 89, and might be considered to represent a fairly good population of hares. The fact that hares were fairly numerous in suitable cover was corroborated by the statements of residents, and by finding hares lying dead in the road, where they had been killed by automobiles. With a larger number of observations from localities selected at random it would have been possible to obtain comparative statements showing the types of habitat most favored by the hares, and also the sections of the state where they were most common. It should be borne in mind that in the above study only apparently suitable situations were examined and that the relative abundance of 89 per cent obtained does not apply to the whole territory, but only to the most favorable parts. If the areas for examination had been selected at random, for example, every 10 miles exactly, the percentage of signs of occurrence would have been much lower.",
