The terms ecologic habitat and ecologic community are here used to designate ecologic divisions of any rank. Field workers dealing with different systematic groups of animals and plants will probably find it convenient to use different grades of ecologic units, depending partly on the size and mobility of the organisms considered. The ecologic communities recognized for ants will probably be smaller in average area covered, and lesser in ecologic rank, than mammal communities will be. The rank of ecologic community which will probably be most generally useful in field work is the association, using this term in the sense of any relatively stable community whether climax or not. For finer distinctions the association may be divided into communities of lower rank, such as strata, societies, and the like. However, if the habitats and communities are carefully described, the field worker need not worry about the rank of the ecologic divisions.
