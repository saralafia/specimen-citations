Species diversity, as measured by H', was highest in the Costan Rican community; each community contained 3-4 common species and many uncommon species. Based on body size and general food habits, niche overlap appears to be greatest among small to intermediate-sized insectivores and frugivores, many of which, however, are apparently uncommon. Four basic reproductive patterns are found among the species. Most frugivores are seasonally polyestrous whereas some insectivores are monestrous and at least one is polyestrous. It is postulated that in both insectivores and frugivores birth peaks coincide with maximum food levels. Recapture patterns of several species suggest that home range size may be positively correlated with body size; omnivorous species may have larger home ranges than similarly sized species with more restricted diets.",

Each paper points to the need for detailed knowledge of the structure of bat faunas at the community level, and particularly of the roles of interacting species. The present study, designed to obtain such data, is based upon fieldwork covering 2 years (June 1966 through May 1967 and August 1970 through August 1971 at two localities in the Panama Canal Zone and one locality in Costa Rica . As with Tamsitt's and McNab's work, this study can be criticized as giving a biased account of bat community structure because of the techniques used, but we believe it represents a reasonable start toward an understanding of bat communities in the New World tropics.",

Because only one level of the forest was sampled during part of the night and because species of bats are caught unequally by mist nets, the following analysis of community structure undoubtedly represents a biased picture of the actual structure of tropical bat communities. Conspicuously missing from the samples are members of the strictly insectivorous families Emballonuridae, Vespertilionidae, and Molossidae, bats that are either adept at avoiding mist nets or that probably forage at heights above mist nets set at ground level. Netting at different heights throughout the night, as Handley (1967) did in Brazil, would undoubtedly have increased the number of species at each locality and made possible comparisons of relative abundance of species at different levels of the forest.",

For males, location of testes (abdominal or scrotal) was recorded, but because testis position is apparently labile in many species, little confidence can be placed in this character as an indication of reproductive state. Females were palpated to determine the presence or absence of embryos (small embryos were undoubtedly missed by this technique), and the condition of the nipples (not evident, lactating, or postlactating) was recorded.",

Greatest length of testis (mm) was employed to estimate the reproductive state of males. Additionally, a few testes and epididimydes were embedded in Tissuemat, serially sectioned at 10 V., and stained with Celestine Blue and eosin. The sections were examined for evidence of spermatogenesis and for spermatozoa in the epididymis. Females were examined for embryos, whose size was expressed as crown-rump length in millimeters. To check for microscopic evidence of pregnancy, the ovaries and uteri of many females were sectioned and stained as described above. Microscopic examination revealed that many early stages of pregnancy (i.e., embryos < 1 mm) were missed so that our estimates of frequency of pregnancy based only on macroscopic examination may be somewhat low.",

Of the several of these represented in the Panamanian samples, most are sufficiently well characterized such that we are reasonably certain of our identifications. We had considerable difficulty with Carollia, however, and were unable to positively identify specimens in the hand in Costa Rica or to interpret the variation seen in the preserved Panamanian collection in terms of the species represented, which possibly include C. castanea H. Allen, C. subrufa (Hahn), C. brevicauda (Wied), and C. perspicillata Linnaeus. Carollia castanea is easily recognizable, but we have not been able to sort satisfactorily the specimens of other species which the range of size variation suggests may be present. In the Panamanian series we see characters (for example, those of shape of upper toothrow and size of lower incisors) said to distinguish perspicillata, subrufa, and brevicauda (Handley 1966 , Pine 1968 ), but those characters do not seem to sort out in any meaningful way. We have, therefore, left them together as one lot under the name Carollia \"perspicillata\" and point out the possibility that more than one species may be represented.",

Since the distribution of these two characters did not differ significantly from \"expected\" distributions based on the entire Panamanian bat fauna (P > .05) in Kolmogorov-Smirnov one-sample tests), we tentatively conclude that if competition has been a major factor in determining the structure of these bat communities, it has not acted by selectively favoring or eliminating body sizes and food habits as they occur in the Panamanian bat \"universe.\" Hypothesis (2) predicts that single occupancy of cells of a \"niche matrix\" should be the rule. As seen in Table 4 , construction of a two-dimensional \"niche matrix\" is sufficient to separate most \"large\" species, but not the \"small\" species. Apparently, increased dimensionality of the \"niche matrix\" is needed to distinguish ecologically the small to intermediate-sized insectivores and frugivores in each community; additional dimensions might include principal foraging heights (and times?) and a finer breakdown of the kinds of fruit or prey items taken. Since, to judge from numbers captured at ground level (which are probably biased toward underestimating true abundances), many of the comparably sized species appear to be uncommon, competition among them for limited resources may not be severe during most of the year. Since it appears that food availability does vary seasonally in the habitats examined (see below), however, competition may increase at certain times of the year among small insectivores and small frugivores. Hutchinson (1959) . In determining the ratios of their trophic appendage, forearm lengths were substituted for skull lengths because the former measurement is easily obtained and is highly correlated (P < .01) with length of upper toothrow, perhaps a better indicator of \"trophic apparatus\" than skull length. The mean forearm ratio of the entire group was 1.26 (Table 9) , which is close to the average value of 1.28 observed by Hutchinson (1959) . Intrageneric ratios, however, were usually lower, and ratios of 1.20 or less were found in every genus except Phyllostomus (Table 9 ).",

Likewise, females carrying embryos in May and June and giving birth in July or August are doing so when fruit is relatively abundant. Although Smythe (1970) was sampling a relatively small number of fruit species (26), his data are probably indicative of the general situation in Panama (also see Croat 1970 ) so that the hypothesis that frugivores are producing young when food levels are high seems tenable. However, whereas young produced during the first parturient period become independent (about 1 month after birth) when fruit levels are relatively high, those born in the second period become independent when the abundance of fruit may be declining (Fig. 9) . Consequences of these declines on young and adults need to be further Smythe (1970) .

In Panama, many of the seasonally breeding species appear to initiate breeding again, after a quiescent period, between October and early December, at or just after the annual peak in rainfall and when daylength is decreasing. The fact that in western Costa Rica, where the dry season begins somewhat earlier, some of the same species begin breeding about 1 month earlier than in the Canal Zone suggests that decreasing amounts of rainfall, rather than photoperiod, may act as a proximate factor for several species. In at least one species, Myotis nigricans, photoperiod is the suspected environmental cue (Wilson and Findley 1970) . Clearly, we need experimental data to identify the specific factor(s) that regulates seasonal reproductive activity in tropical bats.",

This difference in results probably stems from the fact that LaVal captured most of his P. discolor in a banana grove adjacent to riparian forest whereas we netted only in riparian forest; the banana grove has been cut down. As La-Val noted, P. discolor is common in banana groves (for example, at Rodman we captured this species only in a small grove) so that if individuals return to the same grove to feed night after night, the probability of recapturing them should be high. Thus, netting only in banana groves could lead to erroneous conclusions regarding home range sizes of this species.",

Though represented by smaller sample sizes, the following species also have bimodal birth periods in Panama: Artibeus lituratus, A. watsoni, A. phaeotis, Carol/ia castanea, and possibly Vampyrops he/leri and Chiroderma trinitatum(Table 7). In most of these, the first birth period (March or April) occurs in the second half of the dry season and the second (July or August) in the middle of the wet season.In western Costa Rica, where the dry season usually begins 1.5 months earlier than in the Canal Zone, birth periods of A. jamaicensis, C. \"perspicillata\"and Sturnira lilium occur in February, March, June, and July, somewhat earlier than in the Canal Zone.Both macroscopic and microscopic evidence indicates that females of several of the above species are polyestrous and undergo two pregnancies in rapid succession. One young is produced in each pregnancy. Macroscopic evidence includes numerous examples of females simultaneously pregnant and lactating in the period March through July in A. jamaicensis, U. bilobatum, and C. \"perspicillata\" in Panama. There is microscopic evidence for a postpartum estrus in A. jamaicensis (Fleming 1971a) and similar evidence is also available for U. bilobatum.

Spermatogenic cycles of phyllostomatids, poorly known, appear to correlate with seasonal changes in female receptivity. In adults of A. jamaicensis, U. bilobatum, and C. \"perspicillata,\" testis size is largest just preceding those times when females are likely to be sexually receptive ( in A . jamaicensis, July-August and March; in U. bilobatum, September-October and February-March, and in C. \"perspicillata,\" October and March), and are smallest when females are unreceptive owing to pregnancy or seasonal sexual inactivity (Fig. 6). Owing to the seasonal periods of birth in many phyllostomatid bats, age structure of their populations varies seasonally. Figure 7, shows that in Panamanian populations of A. jamaicensis, U. bilobatum, and C. \"perspicillata,\" immatures, which become independent of their mothers at about 1 month of age, are caught most frequently in the period April through October.

Among the seasonally polyestrous species, A. jamaicensis may be unique in that females in Panama apparently undergo a 2.5 month period of delayed embryonic development between September and mid-November (Fleming 1971a). Whether delayed development occurs in other Central and South American populations is not presently known. Females of other species of Artibeus and U. bilobatum and C. \"perspicillata\" in Panama were examined microscopically for evidence of delayed development, but, owing partly to the small samples available, the results were inconclusive. Available evidence does suggest, however, that C. \"perspicillata\" in Panama probably does not undergo delayed development. In summary, many frugivorous species in Panama and Costa Rica have two birth periods, one in the last half of the dry season and the other in the middle of the wet season. Females are po'yestrous and typically produce two young annually. Reproductive activity in males is correlated with periods of female receptivity. Extended season with a short inactive period.-Only one species, the insectivorous Myotis nigricans (Vespertilionidae), is known to have this pattern. In Panama, pregnant females are found from January through early November with individuals producing possibly three young (in three pregnancies) during that time (Wilson and Findley 1970).

At Sherman two species occurred in each of the two size classes (Appendix 1). At La Pacifica, three species of Pteronotus and four species of Micronycteris were netted. Although the relatively low forearm ratios could be taken to indicate that the food niches of these tropical congeners overlap extensively (as concluded by Tamsitt 1967), the absence of detailed information concerning food habits, feeding behavior, and spatial distributions of the species precludes such a conclusion. Interspecific differences in any of the three unstudied factors could easily negate the possible effects of morphological similarity on degree of niche overlap. With our present knowledge, it is unwise to interpret metric similarities or dissimilarities in terms of \"niche overlap.\" Reproduction and food habits The reproductive cycles of all organisms are presumably adapted so that offspring are produced at energetically favorable times of the year. Where food levels vary seasonally, seasonal reproductive cycles should be favored; where food levels remain fairly constant throughout the year, reproduction may be acyclic. The majority of Panamanian and Costa Rican bats examined in this study or reported on elsewhere have seasonal reproductive cycles; this suggests that they face seasonal shortages of food or other resources necessary for successful reproduction. Most frugivores produce two young annually, one toward the end of the dry season and another in the middle of the wet season. Insectivores tend to give birth in the wet season. The question then arises as to whether these birth periods coincide with peaks in the availability of fruit and insects. According to Janzen (1967), the dry season throughout much of Central America is the principal flowering season and the late dry and early wet seasons the principal fruiting season. Offering partial support for this generalization is the observation that the frequency of pollen-laden bats is higher in the dry season than in the wet season in Guanacaste (Heithaus and Fleming, unpublished). Further, in the Panama Canal Zone mangoes (Mangifera indica) and hog plums (Spondias mombin), known bat foods, are most abundant in April and May and in July through September, respectively; however, figs (Ficus insipida), a favorite of Artibeus jamaicensis, produce fruit sporadically throughout the year (Fleming 1971b). On Barro Colorado Island, midway between Rodman and Sherman, \"large fruits\" (e.g., Astrocaryum standleyanum, Oleicarpon panamense, and Anacardium excelsum) drop primarily in February, May, and June whereas \"small fruits\" (e.g., Cecro-This content downloaded from 141.211.4.224 on Thu, 07 Oct 2021 17:30:01 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms pia, Ficus, and Miconia) fall between May and November (Smythe 1970). The low point in the annual fruit cycle in central Panama appears to occur at the end of the wet season and early in the dry season (November through January).",
