Our analysis is based on the genotypes of wild-caught mice from three subspecies of Mus musculus. We show that classical laboratory strains are derived from a few fancy mice with limited haplotype diversity. Their genomes are overwhelmingly Mus musculus domesticus in origin, and the remainder is mostly of Japanese origin. We generated genome-wide haplotype maps based on identity by descent from fancy mice and show that classical inbred strains have limited and non-randomly distributed genetic diversity. In contrast, wild-derived laboratory strains represent a broad sampling of diversity within M. musculus. Intersubspecific introgression is pervasive in these strains, and contamination by laboratory stocks has played a role in this process. The subspecific origin, haplotype diversity and identity by descent maps can be visualized using the Mouse Phylogeny Viewer (see URLs).",

These strains have been the preferred tools in biomedical research. Historical sources and genetic studies suggest that fancy mice had substantial inbreeding 5 . These sources indicate that three subspecies of M. musculus were represented in the genome of fancy mice, making classical strains artificial hybrids between multiple subspecies found in the wild. However, there is disagreement about the relative contribution of each subspecies to classical inbred strains 6, 7 . Classical strains have substantial population structure because of the limited genetic diversity present in fancy mice and the complex schema used in their derivation.",

SNP discovery has involved only a limited number of strains, resulting in SNP panels with substantial ascertainment bias 13 . Pedigree records continue to serve as the primary source of information about the origin and relationships among laboratory strains 5 . Although such records are valuable, genetic studies and the experience of mouse breeders indicate that contamination is common 7 . We have previously reported the presence of intersubspecific introgression in three commonly used wild-derived strains 7 . However, this conclusion has been controversial, and the lack of data from wild-caught mice has prevented consensus among the scientific community. Finally, the M. musculus subspecies are undergoing the early stages of speciation. There is shared variation among subspecies, Subspecific origin and haplotype diversity in the laboratory mouse A r t i c l e s mostly because of polymorphisms that have persisted from a common ancestor and introgression between subspecies in the wild. Thus, selection of a single reference genome for each subspecies cannot accurately reflect the population structure of these recently diverged taxa. Furthermore, the choice of a single inbred strain to represent an entire taxon is particularly problematic because laboratory strains were subject to many generations of selective mating in an artificial setting, where there is high potential for contamination 7 .",

To estimate the size of the fancy mice population from which classical inbred strains A r t i c l e s are derived, we divided their genome into overlapping intervals that have no evidence for historical recombination (Online Methods). We identified 43,285 intervals (median size = 71 kb and median number of SNPs = 12). The distribution of the number of haplotypes in each interval (median and mode = 5) indicates that the original population harbored a limited number of distinct chromosomes ( Supplementary  Fig. 4a ). Over 97% of the genome can be explained by fewer than ten haplotypes. In conclusion, classical strains can be partitioned locally into a small number of classes, within which all strains are identical by descent (IBD) with respect to their common origin. Intervals A r t i c l e s with larger numbers of haplotypes often reflect accumulation of new mutations in the past century, as shown by re-sequencing projects 6, 7, 10 and our analysis of substrains ( Supplementary Fig. 5) .",

For each interval, we estimated the genotype identity among all pairs of strains and defined the minimum number and composition of cliques required to represent the haplotype variation. A critical step in this process was to determine a threshold of genotype identity that corresponds to IBD. This lower bound on genotype identity should be consistent with the accumulation of new mutations over several hundred generations and genotyping error. For this purpose, we carried out an analysis of local similarity among sister substrains. These closely related sets of strains, such as BALB/cJ and BALB/cByJ, did not show evidence of substantial genetic divergence or contamination ( Supplementary Fig. 5 ). We established that 99.0% genotype identity is a suitable threshold for provisional assignment of local IBD status among strains. To further refine this assignment and to address the shortcoming of hard thresholding, we used clique completion to define sets of strains that are mutually IBD to each other and calculated the mean genotype identity within and between cliques. The distribution of the number of cliques is similar to the distribution of the number of haplotypes per interval ( Supplementary Fig. 4 ). Using this approach, we generated a map of haplotype diversity in 100 classical inbred strains (see URLs).",

However, only 9 strains have a genome derived entirely from a single subspecies, 18 have contributions from two subspecies and 35 have contribution from all three subspecies. The prevalence and extent of multi-subspecific origin is a defining characteristic of wild-derived laboratory strains as a group. Our set of wild-derived strains includes ten strains derived from natural intersubspecific hybrids ( Supplementary Table 1) , all of which have, unexpectedly, contributions from all three subspecies. The remarkable discordance in subspecific origin in several strains based on phylogenetic trees (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary  Fig. 7 ) provides further evidence for intersubspecific introgression. The sharing of patterns of subspecific origin between classical inbred strains and some wild-derived strains (Fig. 2) suggests that some of the intersubspecific introgressions in the latter group involved cross breeding with classical strains.",

The fraction of the genome involved (Fig. 3) . This is particularly striking in the PERA/EiJ strain, providing further evidence of the role of classical laboratory strains in intersubspecific introgression in wild-derived laboratory stocks. For each of the 15 wild-derived strains, we tested whether a singledonor classical strain can explain the overall pattern of IBD with all classical strains. Using this approach, we identified the donor of introgressed regions in six wild-derived strains ( Supplementary  Table 1) , including PERA/EiJ. Contamination by CBA/CaJ explains all IBD regions in PERA/EiJ, whereas comparison with any of the other 99 classical inbred strains explains only a fraction of intervals of high local similarity (Fig. 4) .

                "text": "There are two competing views on the origin and composition of the genome of classical inbred strains 6, 7 . One study concluded that the genome of these strains is 68% M. m. domesticus, 10% M. m. molossinus, 6% M. m. musculus, 3% M. m. castaneus and 13% of unknown origin 6 . On the other hand, we previously concluded that 92% is of M. m. domesticus, 6% is of M. m. musculus and 1% is of M. m. castaneus origin 7 . Both studies were based on data from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) 6 , but they took different approaches to the use of wild-derived inbred strains as reference genomes to infer subspecific origin. Researchers from a previous study 6 assumed that the four wild-derived strains, WSB/EiJ, PWD/PhJ, CAST/EiJ and MOLF/EiJ, were faithful representatives of four subspecies, M. m. domesticus, M. m. musculus, M. m. castaneus and M. m. molossinus, respectively. We concluded, however, that three of these wild-derived strains, PWD/PhJ, CAST/EiJ and MOLF/EiJ, had introgressed haplotypes from other subspecies. In regions where a given wild-derived strain has undergone such intersubspecific introgression, the genotypes are not suitable as a reference for that subspecies. The results presented here conclusively show that classical inbred strains are overwhelmingly derived from M. m. domesticus, that the non-M. m. domesticus contribution to their genomes is largely of M. m. molossinus origin and that intersubspecific introgression is common in wild-derived laboratory strains.",

Half of wild-caught mice carry small regions with haplotypes from a second subspecies, mostly in heterozygous combinations. We acknowledge that a larger and more geographically diverse set of mice would be of great interest, but it would have little impact on our conclusions regarding the origin of the genome of the laboratory mouse. We also acknowledge that our definition of diagnostic alleles in SNPs and VINOs may change with the inclusion of more samples. However, this definition provides a simple and robust method to assign phylogenetic origin while preserving enough flexibility to account for genotyping error, homoplasy and gene flow among subspecies in the wild.

In CAST/EiJ and PWD/PhJ, the two strains that were used as references in previous studies, introgression covers 12% and 7% of their genome, respectively, confirming 96% of the regions that were declared introgressed in our previous study ( Supplementary Fig. 9) . We have been able to identify additional regions of introgression in CAST/EiJ and PWD/PhJ because of the better reference genotypes for each subspecies and the combined use of SNPs and VINOs. Subspecies, time since derivation and laboratory history appear to have a strong effect on the prevalence and extent of intersubspecific introgression, which could have occurred in the wild or in the laboratory. The limited extent of introgression in wild-caught samples suggests that breeding in the laboratory played a major role in shaping the genomes of wild-derived strains. Independent confirmation was obtained by comparing the genomes of wild-derived and classical inbred strains. Fifteen wild-derived strains have inherited haplotypes from classical inbred strains. Contamination by classical strains was expected, and likely intentional, in some cases (SOD1/ EiJ and RBB/DnJ) but not in others (CASA/EiJ and CALB/RkJ). Introgression in the remaining wild-derived strains probably arose though a combination of gene flow in the wild (in samples captured close to hybrid zones and recently colonized regions) and breeding in the laboratory to non-classical mouse stocks (most likely other wild-derived mice). Wild-derived inbred strains have been used frequently as models in evolutionary studies 20 . Our results suggest that new information about the subspecific origin of the strains should be incorporated in the analyses.",

Most of these SNPs were selected on the basis of the local phylogeny among the NIEHS strains. This approach ensured that all major local branches were represented while ignoring minor branches. However, the approach also had limitations because locally all branches represented in the array were allocated the same number of SNPs, and therefore, long and short local branches would appear to be equal in length 17 . Furthermore, there are subspecies-specific false negative rates in SNP identification in the NIEHS study, and prior identification of a SNP is a necessary condition for its presence in the array 7 . Subspecies-specific false negative rates in SNP discovery should also negatively impact the rate at which selected SNPs are converted into successful genotyping assays 17 . For example, M. m. castaneus SNPs should be under-represented compared to the true level of diversity because of combined effects of our selection criteria and the higher assay failure rate. However, we were able to overcome the high failure rate by using VINOs. For the purpose of this study, VINOs have the critical advantage of being less subject to ascertainment biases within a given phylogenetic group. However, VINOs can only be reliably detected in homozygosity, resulting in a substantial undercounting of VINOs in some samples (Supplementary Table 1) . We conclude that the combination of SNP and VINO genotype data in wild-caught mice has enormous value for population studies.",

Our maps will enable researchers to determine not only which strains share the same haplotype in a given region but also the sequence divergence among those strains that do not share them. We have also calculated the number of variants used to infer IBD and a score to guide interpretation of these trees by potential users. In particular, we have flagged haplotypes with weak support. Our data and tools should allow researchers to rapidly determine the number of haplotypes in a given region and the level of sequence divergence among them. Both are important considerations for association mapping. These data will also allow researchers to identify discrete regions of genetic divergence between substrains. Finally, they may be used to select strains with the desired level and type of genetic variation in any given region of the genome.",

Although our approach of recombination intervals cannot directly be extended to wild-derived strains, we used a fixed-window approach to determine the level of haplotype diversity and IBD among these strains. This analysis shows that there is much more diversity in wild-derived strains than in classical strains ( Fig. 2b-e) , providing opportunities to optimize genetic research. Analysis of the frequency distribution of genotype identity in pairwise comparisons between wild-derived strains provides insight into the natural history of these strains and the populations from which they were derived. In contrast with comparison to classical inbred strains, these distributions are typically unimodal in intrasubspecific comparisons ( Supplementary Fig. 6b ). However, we also observed a strong signature of IBD in several pairwise comparisons. Some of the strongest instances involve pairs of strains derived from mice trapped in geographically close localities (Supplementary Table 1 ). Excess IBD can be explained by the presence of introgression from classical inbred strains that are themselves IBD for a substantial fraction of their genome ( Supplementary Fig. 6 ). There are some strains that are connected to several cliques, creating a complex network. Finally, all M. m. molossinus wild-derived strains (Supplementary Table 1 ) have very high levels of IBD (~34%). This observation and the unusually high level of genotype identity between the M. m. molossinus haplotypes present in classical strains and the wildderived M. m. molossinus strains strongly suggest a recent population bottleneck in this hybrid subspecies.",

Our genome browser provides access to the trees and links between recombination intervals, local trees and the maps for subspecific origin and haplotype diversity. Our analysis shows that classical inbred strains are in fact mosaics of a handful of haplotypes present in the founder fancy mice population. The genetic divergence among these haplotypes varies widely both locally and across the genome. Furthermore, the contribution of subspecies other than M. m. domesticus is limited, and its distribution highlights the complex population structure in these strains. On the other hand, wildderived laboratory strains represent a deep reservoir of genetic diversity untapped in classical strains and are in many cases analogous to the three-way intersubspecific hybrids that classical inbred strains were thought to be. Our previous work 7, 21 combined with the results of the deep survey of mouse resources presented here shows that the laboratory mouse is an unparalleled model for genetic studies in mammals.",

Most DNA samples were prepared at the University of North Carolina and all were genotyped using the Mouse Diversity Array 17 at The Jackson Laboratory. The processed arrays were computationally genotyped using MouseDivGeno (see URLs), a genotyping software written in R language specifically designed for the Mouse Diversity array. Genotyping of the samples involved three steps: normalization of the intensity variation caused by restriction fragment lengths in the genome amplification step and the C+G content of probe sequences; genotype calling using a combined maximum likelihood and hierarchical clustering algorithm; and identification of VINOs, as described below. We excluded 73,525 SNPs out of a total of 623,124 based on poor performance among our samples. We identified thousands of previously unknown genetic variants using an algorithm designed for mutation discovery in the Affymetrix platform. VINOs are characterized by a distinct clustering of samples with low hybridization intensity and designated by the genotype 'V' . The genotype of the target SNP in a sample with a VINO call is missing. To confirm that VINOs do indeed represent previously unidentified genetic variation, we selected 15 SNP probes with VINO calls, and for each probe, we selected at least four samples of each genotype (homozygous for allele A, homozygous for B or VINO) for targeted sequencing. Strains for resequencing were selected to maximally sample across subspecies and strain type (classical or wild derived). Primers were designed approximately 200 bp proximal and distal to each probe using PrimerQuest (Integrated DNA Technologies). Probe regions were amplified by PCR and sequenced by automated Sanger sequencing at UNC. Sequences were aligned using Sequencher 4.9 (Gene Codes). Supplementary Table 4 lists all probes, strains and primer sequences used. All homozygous SNP genotype calls were confirmed (211 out of 211) as were most of the VINO calls (14 out of 15). Unconfirmed VINO calls could be explained by polymorphisms outside of the sequenced region that, for example, alter the cut sites for the enzymes used for genome-wide amplification. Thus, 100% validation was not expected.We mapped regions of heterozygosity in each laboratory strain by calculating the frequency of heterozygous calls in 500-kb windows with 250-kb overlaps and applied a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with strain-specific noise level. We found that most heterozygous calls in inbred strains reflect genotype calling errors that are randomly distributed throughout the genome, whereas in truly heterozygous regions, heterozygous calls occur in clusters. Array probe design was based on the reference C57BL/6J genome, which is mainly M. m. domesticus. Thus, genotype error rates are higher in strains that do not share common subspecific origin with C57BL/6J. All heterozygous calls in laboratory strains outside of heterozygous regions were replaced by no calls.We identified large deletions that resulted in hybridization failures (VINOs) in multiple consecutive probes by calculating the VINO frequency in 500-kb windows with 250-kb overlap. Using an HMM, we identified contiguous intervals in which VINO frequencies were higher than the strain-specific noise level. We visually mapped the start and end of deletions and designated genotypes in these regions as 'D' . We validated nine of the putative deletions using PCR to amplify markers within and flanking the deletions in DNA samples with or without the deletions. There was 100% concordance between our predictions and the results of this test. See URLs for all genotypes. at a SNP, then the A allele at that SNP is a fully informative and diagnostic for M. m. domesticus. We assigned fully informative SNPs a score of 1. In addition, there are cases where the A allele occurs in only one subspecies but is not fixed in that subspecies. These partially informative SNPs are assigned a score that is the fraction of mice with the homozygous A genotype over the total number of mice in the subspecies. We allowed for up to two misclassifications because of genotyping errors (typically homozygous calls), homoplasy or gene flow in the determination of diagnostic alleles and penalized the score by a factor of 0.5 (one genotype error) or 0.3 (two genotyping errors). No calls and VINOs were ignored in this procedure.",

We assigned subspecific origin based on diagnostic alleles and scores from a given subspecies in each region of a sample. An HMM was used to identify the boundaries and subspecific origin based on the cumulative scores within these regions.Recombination intervals and perfect phylogeny trees. The genome of classical inbred strains was partitioned into overlapping intervals that show no evidence of recombination using the four-gamete test. Maximal intervals were computed by a left-to-right scan, adding successive SNPs to an interval until one is not four-gamete compatible with any SNP in that interval. The starting point of the next interval was found by removing SNPs from the left side until all incompatibilities have been removed, and left-to-right scan resumed. All resulting intervals were maximal and could not be extended in either direction. A minimal subset of these intervals was found that covers the entire genome while maximizing their overlap. This is computed by finding the longest path in a k-partite graph 22 . For each such compatible interval, there exists a 'perfect' phylogenetic tree in which each node corresponds to a haplotype and each edge to SNPs with the same strain distribution.Identity by descent. To identify IBD regions in classical strains, we first performed pairwise comparisons and then expanded the IBD strain set using a clique-finding algorithm. IBD regions were defined based on the compatible intervals framework described above. The sizes of the compatible intervals were often too small to calculate robust statistics; thus, we merged consecutive compatible intervals for pairs of strains sharing the same terminal leaf node of consecutive perfect trees. Based on the merged intervals, we calculated a pairwise genotype similarity score as the proportion of matching variants (SNPs and VINOs) in that interval. After we assigned the score to each pair in each compatible interval, we identified the cliques in each interval. We connected pairs of strains with similarity scores >0.99. To accommodate poorly performing samples and noise, we implemented a clique extension algorithm and generated a single clique if at least 80% of edges were connected and the mean average similarity was >0.99. Strains belonging to the same clique in an interval were considered IBD over that interval. The reliability of this IBD analysis depends on the number of variants used to calculate the similarity score. Thus, to estimate the degree of reliability in each clique, we calculated a clique penalty score. First, we calculated P ij = log 10 (number of variants used to calculate the similarity score) for every pair of strains, and we capped the number of variants per interval at 100. Then, the penalty score is calculated as a variance of P ij . The logarithmic transformation inflates the variance from pairs with a small number of variants. If the number of variants from all pairs of strains is more than 100, the penalty is zero. We flagged cliques with less than 20 variants or less than 40 variants with high clique penalty score. We excluded regions with very low SNP density from the IBD analyses. Excluded regions are listed in Supplementary Table 5 . Finally, we excluded a single region with a pattern consistent with structural variation (Supplementary Table 6 ).To identify regions of IBD in comparisons involving wild-derived strains, we calculated the genotype similarity in pairwise comparisons using 1-Mb nonoverlapping intervals. We declared regions to be IBD based on a threshold of 0.98 identity, but we also considered the overall shape of the frequency distribution.Distance trees. Each distance tree is based on the mean score of strains belonging to the same clique and provides a quantitative measure of difference among strains belong to different cliques. In each compatible interval, we generated a similarity clique score matrix M of size N \u00d7 N, where N is the number of cliques, and each element M[i,j] was a mean similarity between strains belonging to clique i and clique j. We built a neighbor-joining tree based on this matrix.Clique coloring. Using eight pastel colors, we assigned unique colors to each haplotype in an interval such that the total color change across all intervals was minimized. For the first interval, colors were assigned arbitrarily to each haplotype. If there were more than eight haplotypes in an interval, the least frequent were not assigned colors and remain white.
