This has been in use for several years and in it there have been satisfactorily reared large numbers of deer mice (Peromyscus) and house mice, as well as f smaller numbers of red-backed mice (Clethrionomys) and harvest mice (Reithrodontomys). The advantages of the new cage are the slight danger of individual animals' escaping while being handled, the rapidity with which a large number of cages can be provided with daily food and water, the ease of cleaning, and the low cost of construction.",

The cage is simple in design, and the only tools necessary for its construction are square, saw, hammer, auger, and tin shears.

The top is mostly a wooden lid, which is held in place by weight alone. The bottom of the cage is an enameled iron pan, in which the upper part of the cage rests.

Also nail a narrow strip of wire screen across the inside lower edge of the back to prevent the animals from gnawing.

To support the water bottle a short length of 16-gauge galvanized wire is sprung around it in a tight coil, about 1 inch from its upper end. One deer mouse learned to pull the water bottle down into the cage and escape through the opening. The mouse was able to do this even though the coil of wire was sprung on the tube very tightly.

The screen is cut so that at the top the opening is the full width of the glass, but at the bottom the cut edges overlap the glass slightly. The glass is placed in position with the bottom a little more inside than outside the cage. A short piece of soft 22-gauge wire encircles the glass on the inside of the cage and the ends are attached to the cut edges of the screen. This prevents these edges from flaring out and leaving an opening through which mice could escape. If properly adjusted the wire need not be unfastened when one removes the glass for cleaning, but the glass can be rolled out of position and then pulled off.",

Different subspecies, however, differ markedly in their tendency to fight. Nearly always the mouse at home in the cage will attack the presumed intruder. Males are less likely to attack females, and for this reason it is advisable to place the female in the cage of the male, the two having been for a few days previously in cages side by side. A better method is to place both mice in a clean cage, where both are in equally strange surroundings.",
