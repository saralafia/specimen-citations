However, many endangered species inhabit remote areas of limited access and finding populations to determine their distribution is often a difficult task. The Nelson's small-eared shrew, Cryptotis nelsoni (Merriam, 1895) , is a poorly known small mammal endemic to cloud forests in Los Tuxtlas, a mountain range along the Gulf of Mexico coast that is included within Los Tuxtlas Biosphere Reserve. Los Tuxtlas rises from sea level to the summit of three main volcanoes where access is difficult: San Mart\u00edn Tuxtla volcano (1750 m), Santa Marta (1700 m) and San Mart\u00edn Pajapan (1150 m).",

One site is located on the northeast face of the crater of the volcano San Martin Tuxtla, which is very close to the records reported by Cervantes and Guevara (2010) . At this site, we divided traps into two different elevations (18\u00b033'27\"N, 95\u00b011'24\"W at 1,290 m; 18\u00b033'54\"N, 95\u00b011'9\"W at 1,460 m).

We used a maximum entropy method in maxent 3.3.4, which is a presencebackground technique that uses localities of known presence and a random sample of pixels from the study region to characterise the environments preferred by the species (Phillips et al. 2017). The relatively small number of localities of C. nelsoni makes it extremely challenging to characterise adequately its climatic requirements. To overcome this, we pooled together the localities of C. nelsoni with localities of their sister species, C. mexicanus, which is well-sampled and common through cloud forests from central-eastern Mexico (Guevara and Cervantes 2013). Pooling the occurrence records of closely related species into a single dataset increases the number of localities, improving the robustness of niche models for rare species (Qiao et al. 2017 ; occurrences records are available as Suppl. Material (Suppl. material 2). For predictor variable selection, model calibration and evaluation, we followed recent best-practices recommendations to estimate potential distributions of cloud forest species (Guevara et al. 2017) . To display the final potential distribution, we divided the continuous prediction into a binary one (suitable vs. unsuitable) using the 10 percentile training presence threshold, where 10% of the localities having the lowest predicted values are excluded. Suitability values above this threshold were preserved in the original continuous format.",

At the second site (1,180 m), we found six specimens in small patches of secondary forest, surrounded by hiking trails (CNMA 49298-40303), which suggested some tolerance towards human disturbance of natural habitats. All the specimens displayed external characters of Cryptotis nelsoni reported previously (Cervantes and Guevara 2010 , Choate 1970 , Merriam 1895 . They differed markedly from C. mexicanus and C. p. pueblensis in having a darker pelage and by their larger external body size, being similar to the specimens referred to C. nelsoni. The forefeet and fore claws were also distinctly broader and longer than C. mexicanus and C. p. pueblensis. The morphometric comparison corroborated our preliminary identification based on external characters. Scatterplots revealed that the collected specimens were larger than C. mexicanus and C. p. pueblensis in all variables examined and completely overlaps with the previously known specimens of C. nelsoni (Fig. 2) .",

All specimens are deposited at the National Collection of Mammals at the Institute of Biology, UNAM. Detailed specimen information is provided as Suppl. Material (Suppl. material 3). To our knowledge, no other specimen of C. nelsoni has been collected in other parts of Los Tuxtlas. The ecological niche model yielded a realistic estimation showing a prediction tightly associated with the distribution of cloud forests in Mexico. Suitable areas were identified only in San Mart\u00edn Tuxtla and Santa Marta volcanoes, which were separated by unsuitable areas that suggest current geographic isolation between them. The highest suitability values largely corresponded to the highest and most inaccessible parts of Los Tuxtlas (see 1 and 2 inserted in Fig. 3 ). Scatterplots of quantitative variables for Cryptotis nelsoni, C. mexicanus and C. parvus pueblensis and specimens collected in the most recent exploration in Los Tuxtlas, a new record for C. nelsoni (NR). Condylobasal length versus height of coronoid process (A) and length of molariform tooth row versus breadth of palate across second molars (B) corroborate the identification of the new records as C. nelsoni.",

In Los Tuxtlas, most of the small mammal sampling efforts have been conducted on lower and mid elevation range habitats, close to well-communicated towns and rural communities (Estrada et al. 1994 , Gonz\u00e1lez-Christen 2008 , Coates et al. 2017 . Interestingly, there is a consistent absence of records of Cryptotis nelsoni in these lower and mid elevation sites, possibly reflecting true absences. This suggests that C. nelsoni is restricted to cloud forest habitats found in high elevations. Given that highlands of Sierra Santa Marta hold suitable climatic conditions, we propose that C. nelsoni can also occur in this isolated area. It is likely that the scarcity of records in this remote area is a consequence of incomplete surveys.",

Then, by using ecological niche modelling, combined with proper surveying techniques, the efficiency of sampling populations of critically endangered small mammals can be increased. Determining the current distribution of C. nelsoni is a first step to provide crucial information for understanding its evolutionary history and conservation status, as well as establishing long-term conservation actions in Los Tuxtlas. We urge the initiation of long-term surveys in poorly sampled and climatically suitable areas to accurately characterise the geographic distribution of this endangered species. Fortunately, all known and potential localities of C. nelsoni are included within Los Tuxtlas Biosphere Reserve, highlighting its importance in maintaining a high species richness and endemism. Nonetheless, regional deforestation and climate change still pose conservation threats to this shrew (Dirzo and Garc\u00eda 1992, Rojas-Soto et al. 2012) .",

White circles are records from 2003 and 2004 in San Mart\u00edn Tuxtla (Cervantes and Guevara 2010); white triangles and star (Mastagaga hill) are the new localities reported in our study. Black points are database records of other small mammals collected with the same sampling techniques as shrews, while the histogram shows the elevational distribution of these records. Darker colours indicate increasingly high elevation areas, while the dashed line depicts Los Tuxtlas Biosphere Reserve. Reddish pixels at 1 km indicate climatically suitable areas for Cryptotis nelsoni according to the maxent model; more reddish colours indicate more suitable habitat conditions."
