    "abstract": "Weaponry is ubiquitous in male ungulates and is driven by intrasexual selection, but the mystery surrounding its sporadic presence in females remains unsolved. Female horns are often smaller and shaped differently to male horns, suggesting a different function; indeed, hypotheses explaining the presence of female horns include competition for food, male mollification and defence against predators. Here we use comparative phylogenetic analyses to show that females are significantly more likely to bear horns in bovids that are conspicuous due to large body size and living in open habitats than inconspicuous species living in closed habitats or that are small. An inability to rely on crypsis or take refuge in deep vegetation has apparently driven the evolution of horns for defence against predators in female bovids, a finding supported by many field observations. Typically, exceptions are small species where females are territorial (e.g. duikers) and use horns in intrasexual contests. Furthermore, we suggest that conspicuousness and territoriality hypotheses may explain other instances of female cranial weaponry (i.e. antlers and ossicones) in other horned ruminants. Our phylogenetic reconstruction indicates that the primary function of horns in females is linked to antipredator defence in most clades, but occasionally to intrasexual competition in others.",

In contrast, females have antlers in only one species of cervid, and the presence of horns is highly variable across female bovid species, a problem that vexed even Darwin (1874) . There have been several attempts to explain the evolutionary causes of horn production in female bovids. Roberts (1996) suggested that horns in females may have evolved due to competition over food resources, providing evidence that presence in females is correlated with increased group size. Estes (1991) proposed that female horns are a form of mimicry of males to mollify male aggression targeted at sons, citing a general trend where females of species that form mixed-sex groups are more likely to bear horns than females of species where the sexes remain separate. Packer (1983) suggested that female horns serve in defence against predators, showing that females of heavier species are more likely to bear horns. Finally, Kiltie (1985) proposed that in most species, female horns are non-adaptive and persist due to pleiotropy, and a genetic shift to a hornless condition may lead to sterility.",

Moreover, there are numerous accounts of female bovids defending themselves or offspring against predatory attack using their horns as weapons (Kruuk 1972; Sinclair 1977; Mech & Nelson 1990; Gese 1999 ). Yet, despite these observations, attempts to explain varied presence of female horns between taxa have continued to flounder owing to lack of clear predictions, failure to pit alternative hypotheses against each other, and absence of phylogenetic controls.",

                "text": "Antipredator defences in animals fall into two exclusive categories: (i) crypsis or (ii) defence against predatory attack, which can be active or passive as in the case of aposematism (Poulton 1890) . In birds and mammals, including bovids ( Jarman 1974) , crypsis is enhanced in small species that can hide even in low grass (Caro 2005) , and in species living in forested habitat where vegetation makes hiding effective (Stoner et al. 2003; Bro-J\u00f8rgensen 2008) . As such, we propose that it is not body size per se that primarily influences the need for defensive weaponry (Packer 1983) , but rather that conspicuous species that are visible to predators from long distances will benefit more from weaponry because they are more likely to be noticed and hunted than short or forest-living species. After all, heavy species living in dense forests (e.g. tragelaphines) are sufficiently concealed and can probably still rely on crypsis to avoid predation. Therefore, a 'conspicuousness' hypothesis for the presence of horns in females predicts that if horns function for antipredator defence, then conspicuous species (large species living in open habitats where they cannot hide from predators) would benefit from using morphological structures in active defence, whereas inconspicuous species (small species or species living in exclusively closed habitats) should not invest in developing energetically costly weaponry. In addition, we propose that in some species, female horns might be favoured due to female intrasexual combat over territories (Clutton-Brock 2009) . Although female territoriality is unusual in bovids (26/117 spp.), an alternative 'territoriality' hypothesis would predict that selection would favour horns in species where females mark and defend territories against conspecifics. Roberts (1996) stressed competition for food in large groups in his 'female competition hypothesis' but did discuss the role of female territoriality per se. He did not test female territoriality explicitly, and his reliance on the positive correlation between group size and horn presence actually opposes the prediction that species showing female territory defence should be more likely to bear horns because these species do not form large groups.",

As in previous studies (Kiltie 1985; Roberts 1996) , we tested for the effect of two different measures of body size, shoulder height and body mass, on the evolution of horns. We distinguish between these two measures in our analyses because, in addition to their impacts on defensive capability, shoulder height has a greater impact on conspicuousness because taller species would probably be more conspicuous to predators from longer distances, whereas body mass has a greater impact on reducing escape speed. Following Roberts (1996) , for each species, we recorded the midpoint of the range of shoulder heights and the minimum body mass reported by Nowak (1999) . Both shoulder height and body weight were logarithmically transformed to achieve normality.",

We determined that the tracing of female horn evolution on this composite tree has strong phylogenetic signal (Blomberg et al. 2003 ; p , 0.001) using PDAP 6.0 software (Garland et al. 1993) ; therefore, related species tend to resemble each other in their tendency for females to have horns. We pitted hypotheses based on body size, habitat openness and intraspecific competition against each other. We calculated standardized independent contrasts (FIC: Felsenstein 1985) for each of the above factors (territoriality, shoulder height, body mass, habitat openness and group size) using the PDTREE module (Midford et al. 2005) in MESQUITE 2.5 (Maddison & Maddison 2008) to account for shared ancestry. In order to test the effect of each factor on horn presence simultaneously, we tested these contrast variables using multiple linear regression models (forced through the origin: Garland et al. 1992) in SPSS 17.0. Preliminary analyses revealed significant bivariate correlations between all predictor variables (all p , 0.02), except between body mass and territoriality (p \u00bc 0.115). To avoid collinearity issues and to determine which of these predictors best explained the variance in the presence of horns in females, we used forward stepwise model selection procedures: all five factors were simultaneously tested against each other with the most significant factor entering the model first. The cutoff for entry into the model was set at p \u00bc 0.1, and factors were entered until only those with probabilities less than this value were in the model. Statistical results given for non-significant factors excluded from the model are the results for that factor if it were to be included in the model at the next step.",

Therefore, we compiled an 'exposure' metric by multiplying a species' log 10 (shoulder height) by the mean openness (0-1) of its primary habitat(s). Shoulder height was used instead of body mass because shoulder height likely has a greater impact on visibility than mass. The multiplication of openness by height allows tall species living in dense forests (e.g. bongos, Tragelaphus eurycerus) to score very low on the exposure scale, moderately sized species living in deserts to retain intermediate scores (e.g. gazelles), and tall species living in completely open habitats (e.g. muskoxen: Ovibos moschatus) to score very high.",

There was a clear breakpoint in the distribution of 'exposure' at a score of 1.0, so species with scores less than 1.0 were classified as 'not exposed', and those with scores greater than 1.0 were classified as 'exposed'. The effects of these uncorrected categorical exposure and territoriality variables on horn presence in females were tested with simple x 2 tests using SPSS 17.0. We tested exposure and territoriality against horns separately. We then combined the two predictors into a single variable ('exposed OR territorial' versus 'not exposed and non-territorial') and tested it against horns.",

RESULTS (a) Analysis I First, we pitted shoulder height, body mass, openness of habitat, female territoriality, and group size against each other to test their relative ability to explain horn presence in females. We found that openness of habitat had the greatest effect on the presence of horns (t \u00bc 4.592, n \u00bc 116, p , 0.001, r \u00bc 0.397), where females of species living in more open environments were more likely to bear horns. We also found that territoriality had a significant effect on the presence of horns in females (t \u00bc 2.930, n \u00bc 116, p \u00bc 0.004, r \u00bc 0.266) in which females that actively mark or defend territories have horns. Females of heavier species were also more likely to have horns (t \u00bc 2.218, n \u00bc 116, p \u00bc 0.029, r \u00bc 0.204). With body mass included in the final model, shoulder height did not have a significant effect on female horn presence (t \u00bc 2 0.164, n \u00bc 116, p \u00bc 0.870, r \u00bc 2 0.015). Similarly, group size had no effect on the presence of horns in females (t \u00bc 1.255, n \u00bc 116, p \u00bc 0.212, r \u00bc 0.118) and was left out of the final regression model (F 3,113 \u00bc 11.103, p , 0.001, adjusted R 2 \u00bc 0.207).",

(c) Analysis III Using the categorical version of the exposure metric, we found that 92.3 per cent (60/65) of exposed species had horns (figure 1; x 2 \u00bc 32.919, d.f. \u00bc 1, p , 0.001). Similarly, 88.4 per cent (23/26) of species where females are territorial also exhibit horns in females (figure 1; x 2 \u00bc 5.384, d.f. \u00bc 1, p \u00bc 0.020). Females of the remaining three territorial hornless species (Madoqua spp.) mark territories but do not defend them. Importantly, when the territoriality and conspicuousness hypotheses were considered simultaneously, 80 out of the 82 species where female carry horns could be accounted for (figure 1;",

In all models, measures of conspicuousness (openness and exposure) explained the greatest amount of variance in the presence of horns, followed by female territoriality. That body mass was also a significant factor in the evolution of horns suggests that heavier animals are less able to rely on swift flight to escape predators and, as Packer (1983) suggested, may be better able to defend themselves against predators. Group size was less effective at explaining the variance in female horn presence and its significant role in past studies may be a byproduct of its significant correlation with the other predictors in the model. Figure 1 shows that horns probably evolved several times in female bovids for defence (bovines, antilopines, caprines, hippotragines and alcelaphines) and once for intrasexual combat (cephalophines). Interestingly, in female territorial species where only certain populations display female horns, those populations that do display horns tend to have higher levels of female territoriality (e.g. klipspringers), suggesting that differences among populations in species ecology can have significant impact on natural selection favouring the evolution of horns in females; although we did not test this explicitly.",

Female Tibetan antelope or 'chiru' (Pantholops hodgsonii ) lack horns, have large bodies, live in open deserts and grasslands, and would appear to be highly exposed to predators in this landscape. However, chiru are unique in that they dig shallow (approx. 30 cm) depressions in the dirt to lie down in and hide from predators, probably reducing the degree to which they are exposed to predators from afar. This novel means of reducing exposure may have tipped the balance in favour of crypsis and relaxed the need to evolve or maintain weaponry in females of this species.",

Three admittedly speculative points are relevant and may provide ideas for others to investigate. (i) While 11 species of cervid would be classified as 'exposed' based on the bovid criterion (exposure . 1.0), the necessity of growing antlers each year may increase the cost of weaponry and shift the threshold of conspicuousness needed for the costs to outweigh the protective benefits of antlers in females. Indeed, females of only one cervid species, reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) have antlers, and females keep their antlers longer after the rut than males, allowing them to achieve dominance over males and gain access to valuable feeding sites for themselves, their unborn offspring, and their yearling calves (Espmark 1964) . (ii) Among the giraffids, where females of both species have horn-like ossicones, giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis) are conspicuous on the plains (T. Caro 2008, personal observation), use strong kicks to fend-off predators, but it is not known if ossicones are used as well. Okapi (Okapia johnstoni ) are inconspicuous (large body, exclusively closed habitat), but females live alone in exclusive home ranges (Hart 1992) and may therefore, defend these territories against other females using weaponry. (iii) Antilocaprids (pronghorn: Antilocapra americana) currently lack any natural non-human predators, are highly conspicuous, live exclusively in open environments, are large and both sexes have pronghorns; although, female ornaments are very short and stubby. Many aspects of pronghorn antipredator behaviour are geared to predators that have recently gone extinct on the North American continent (Byers 1999) , and this may apply to female horns too. Note that the other ruminant groups, moschids (musk deer) and tragulids (chevrotains), are all inconspicuous (all live in closed habitats and are small), and both sexes lack antlers entirely in both groups.",

Females of the last four are horned although the function of horns in three of them is probably for intrasexual female combat, leaving Taurotragus derbianus as the bovid anomaly.

Conspicuous, open country species that are tall or large in size cannot hide, may have slower escape speeds, and are driven to carry horns to defend themselves and offspring; in addition, their large size must be a benefit in self-defence. Conversely, inconspicuous, small or closed habitat species are cryptic and relieved of the burden of evolving antipredator weaponry. Nearly all other cases of horns are found in territorial taxa where females use horns to defend their territories against conspecific females. Our results suggest that competition between females over food in large groups has had little effect on the evolution of horns in females. Weaponry in female bovids is thus principally driven by natural selection, whereas weaponry in males in all taxa and in females in certain taxa is driven by intrasexual selection, both processes driving evolution of the same morphological structure in one taxonomic group.
