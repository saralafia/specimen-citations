This is true for some members of domesticated strains as well as for wild individuals. Even a concealed observer may be detected by his breathing, slight movements, or odor. Also, some of those mammals which mostly are nocturnal, such as Perotrujscus, may not react normally when the light intensity is high enough for the human eye to follow their movements. Furthermore, a shy individual may take a long time to perform 'a prescribed task, so that an inordinate amount of effort may be required to observe its responses directly. For these reasons, accurate measurements of the behavioral responses of many kinds of mammals require the use of automatic recording equipment.",

Types are available also with gang switches which can control tip to 'ten or more circuits simultaneously. One of these gangs can be wired to shut off the timer itself at the completion of its cycle, so that the sequence of operations will not be repeated until the operator again closes the circuit. Counters and timers.-The movements of an animal subject in an experimental apparatus can best be recorded by electrically operated counters and timers.

A much cheaper timer consists of. an ordinary kitchen clock driven by a synchronous motor. Before purchasing such a clock, however, it should be checked to make sure that the sweep second hand does not coast for a second or more after the current is shut off. Also, care-should be taken to secure a clock whose dial actually is marked in seconds. Not all clock dials are so marked. A shorting button inserted in the relay circuit to the clock enables the second hand to be reset to zero or to some multiple of 10 seconds. The setting of the hands is recorded at the start and also at the close ofeach test and the number of elapsed seconds obtained by subtraction. This type of clock requires more effort to secure time records than does a laboratory .type of timer and also there is more danger of making errors in the readings. The kitchen clock, however, does have the advantage that it will record intervals up to as much as 12 hours in length. Sometimes, therefore, I have included both a laboratory timer and a kitchen clock in the same circuit to make those measurements that might-take a long time to complete.",
