Cytological analysis of the mouse Y* chromosome revealed a complex rearrangement involving acquisition of a functional centromere and centromeric heterochromatin and attachment of this chromosomal segment to the distal end of a normal Y chromosome. This rearrangement positioned the Y short-arm region at the distal end of the Y* chromosome and the pseudoautosomal region interstitially. just distal to the newly acquired centromere. In addition, the majority of the pseudoau tosomal region was inverted. Recombination between the X and the Y* chromosomes generates two new sex chromosomes: (1) a large chromosome comprised of the X chromosome attached at its distal end to all of the Y* chromosome but missing the cen tromeric region (XY*) and (2) a small chromosome containing the centromeric portion of the Y* chromosome attached to Gband-negative material from the X chromosome (Y*x). Mice that inherit the XY' chromosome develop as sterile males, whereas mice that inherit the Y*x chromosome develop as fer tile females. Recovery of equal numbers of recombinant and nonrecombinant offspring from XY* males supports the hy pothesis that recombination between the mammalian X and Y chromosomes is necessary for primary spermatocytes to suc cessfully complete spermatogenesis and form functional sperm.",

This Y chromosome was of particular interest because the rearrangement of Y chro mosomal material appeared to include transposition of the pseudoautosomal region. Here we present the results of a more extensive investigation of this aberrant chromosome, including verification that the pseudoautosomal region is adjacent to the functional centromere. Chromosomal banding and in situ hy bridization studies indicate that the functional centromere was acquired from another chromosome, possibly the X chromo some. Although the rearranged Y chromosome lacks a cytologi cally detectable short arm. data analyses performed after restric tion-enzyme banding, in situ hybridization, and Southern blot ting indicate that DNA sequences present on the normal Y short arm are located at the distal end of the Y* chromosome. In addi tion. data from Southern blot hybridization with the telomere consensus sequence (TTAGGG) suggest that the normal Y short-arm telomere is present and functions as the distal Y* tel omere. We propose T(XAl?:InY)8Ei as the official name of this aberrant Y chromosome, with Y* (\"Y star\") as the short-hand designation.",

The centromeres are represented as circles, with the Y* centromere filled to indicate acquisition from another chromosome. The solid section represents acquired centromeric heterochromatin. The diagonally hatched segment represents the pseudoautosomal region, while the horizontally hatched segment represents the region derived from the Y short arm.

Fig. 5 . Model explaining the origin of the Y* chromosome. For ease of presentation, the length of the pseudoautosomal region is exaggerated, and the pseudoautosomal region is divided into four segments, 1-4. In this hypothesis, Y* resulted from three chromosomal breaks: one break occurred within or just distal to the centromeric heterochromatin (CH) of an unknown chromosome, and two breaks occurred in the Y chromosome long arm. one at the distal end of the pseudoautosomal (PA) region (diagonally hatched), between segments 3 and 4 (Break I). and one between segments I and 2 (Break 2). near the junction of the long-arm sequences and the PA region. The cen tromere (filled circle) and CH (solid-black segment) from the unknown chro mosome then attached to the broken PA region of the Y chromosome contain ing segments 2-3 (at Break 2). and the remainder of the Y chromosome (the short arm [horizontally hatched], centromere [open circle], and remainder of the Y long arm. minus the PA segment 4) attached to the broken end of the PA region at segment 3 (Break I). Segment 4. including the pseudoautosomal telomere, was probably deleted. Deletion of PA segment 4 would account for the observed reduction in Mov-15/l hybridization to the Y* chromosome, compared to that on the normal Y chromosome. Inversion of PA segments 2 and 3 occurred during the rearrangement of Y-chromosoma! material. Inver sion of the majority of the PA region would maintain polarity between the PA region of the X and Y* chromosomes, and recombination within this region would account for the recovery of the XY* and Y*x chromosomes from XY* males. However, segment I of the PA region is shown not inverted, as this would allow for inverted pairing and recombination between the X and Y* chromosomes, as indicated by the presence of a dicentric sex chromosome or an acentric fragment in 10% of meiotic metaphase II cells from XY* males (see Hale el al.. 1991) . The original Y centromere is shown in gray to denote it being present but inactivated (gray). some. In situ hybridization with MSat5 confirmed the presence of major satellite sequences at the centromeric end of the Y* chromosome, indicating that they were acquired from another chromosome.

Thus, if the X chromosome is the origin of the Y* functional centromere and centromeric heterochromatin, the X-chromosomal breakpoint must have occurred proximal to the 70-38 sequences. Although the chromosomal origin of the centromere and centromeric heterochromatin (major satellite sequence) on the Y* chromo some remains unknown, the X chromosome seems a likely source of these sequences. Analysis of synaptonemal complexes in XY* males revealed that the centromeric region of the Y* chromosome is often associated with the centromeric region of the X chromosome (see the accompanying paper [Hale et al.. 1991] ). suggesting homology between these chromosomal seg ments. The hypothesized source of the Y* centromere and cen tromeric heterochromatin is indicated in the nomenclature by the designation \"X A 1 ?\". indicating that the donor chromosome is presumed, but not proven, to be the X chromosome.",

We propose that the Y* chro mosome originated as a consequence of three chromosomal breaks. One break occurred in a chromosome, possibly the X chromosome, at a position within or just distal to the centro meric heterochromatin, and two breaks occurred in the pseu doautosomal region of the Y chromosome. Joining of the broken ends resulted in inversion of the majority of the pseu doautosomal region and attachment of this region to the for eign-derived chromosomal segment containing a centromere and centromeric heterochromatin. In addition, a distally posi tioned Y-chromosomal segment (possibly including the pseudoautosomal telomere) was lost. Thus, the newly formed Y* chromosome contains all of the Y-specific regions intact, with the short-arm region now positioned at the distal end and the pseudoautosomal region located interstitially. just distal to the newly acquired centromere. This model also includes reten tion of the original Y centromere: however, the mitotic stability of the Y* chromosome and the presence of a single primary con striction proximal to the acquired centromeric heterochromatin suggest that the original Y centromere is nonfunctional. (There is precedent for the occurrence of stable dicentric mammalian chromosomes by inactivation of one centromere [e.g.. Earnshaw and Migeon. 1985: Peretti et al., 1986; Therman et al., 1986 : Earnshaw et al.. 1989 : Wandall. 1989 Haaf and Schmid, 1990: Maraschio et al., 1990] .) It could be argued that the Y centro mere was deleted during the formation of the Y*: however, two additional Y chromosomal breakpoints would be requiredone on the short arm just above the centromere and one on the long arm distal to the centromere.",

Evans et al. (1982) pre sented a similar hypothesis, suggesting that a reciprocal ex change between the X and Y chromosomes is a regular and nec essary requirement for the production of functional sperm. Meiotic and segregation data from S.\\T-carrier males (Cattanach et al.. 1971 : Keitges et al.. 1987 and XY* males support the X-Y crossover hypothesis. For example, whereas 80% of diakinesis and metaphase I cells in XY* males contain unival ent, nonrecombinant sex chromosomes. 100% of the metaphase II cells in XY* males contain recombinant sex chromosomes (Hale et al.. 1991) . This apparent discrepancy is resolved, how ever, if germ cells in which X-Y* recombination had not occurred are eliminated between metaphase I and metaphase II. This explanation is also concordant with our finding that XY* males sire equal numbers of recombinant and nonrecombinant progeny. Whether X-Y pairing per se or X-Y recombination is a prerequisite for production of functional sperm in normal XY male mice still needs to be confirmed and awaits identification of pseudoautosomal markers for assessing recombination.",

Because it can be readily identified in nonbanded metaphasc preparations, its use would facilitate the ordering of X-linked loci by in situ hybridization. In addition, the XY\" chromosome can be readily separated from the rest of the chromosomal complement by flow sorting, there by expediting the construction of DNA libraries with enriched X-and Y-derived sequences. The Y*x chromosome has already proven a useful tool. Because XY*X females have a high fre quency of sex-chromosome nondisjunction, patroclinous XO females can be routinely recovered from matings involving XY*X females (Hunt. 1991) . Furthermore, approximately 33% of the offspring of XY*X females are XYY*X males (Hunt and Eicher. 1991) . When these males are mated to normal females, 25% of the offspring are XXY males, making it now relatively easy to produce these previously rare males for study. Finally, meiotic and segregation analysis of XYY*X males has led to the interesting observation that, compared with the normal Y chro mosome. the Y*x chromosome preferentially pairs with the X chromosome (Hunt and Eicher. 1991) . The basis for the ability of the small Y*x chromosome to outcompete the Y chromo some for pairing with the X chromosome awaits further study.",
