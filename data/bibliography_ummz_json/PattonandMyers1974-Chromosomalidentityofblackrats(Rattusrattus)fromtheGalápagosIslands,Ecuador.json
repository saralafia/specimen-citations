All 3 chemicals were strong inhibitors of male attraction to females. As strong evidence has been obtained for the identity of trans-8, trans-lO-dodecadien-1-ol with the natural codling moth pheromone 7, our results seem to suggest that the females emit this compound at a lower rate than Codlemone caps since their attractancy was reduced more drastically by inhibitors.",
