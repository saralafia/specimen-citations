Unfortunately, many early naturalists were unaware of the characters that distinguish closely related taxa, so their descriptions were often found to apply to two or more superficially similar species. The late recognition that descriptions alone are inadequate to determine stable taxonomic usage was responsible for the development of the type concept and its codification by international biological consensus in the mid-20th century (Mayr et al., 1953) . Designating type specimens (the formal equivalent of pointing; Ghiselin, 1995) has the crucial advantage that diagnostic characters omitted in the original description can be determined by subsequent examination, and this practice is now required for all new species. For older names based on diagnostically inadequate descriptions, the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN, 1999: Article 75) permits the designation of neotypes as necessary to resolve problems of conflicting or ambiguous application.",

Among his considerable accomplishments (Beddall, 1975; Mones and Klappenbach, 1997) , Azara described some 75 species of native mammals, of which about 80% were previously unknown to science (Hershkovitz, 1987 ).",

Additional comments on mammalian identifications were provided in a later work summarizing his South American travels and observations (Azara, 1809: the ''Voyages'') . Throughout these publications, Azara used only vernacular (Amerindian and/or Spanish) names for the species he reported, but his descriptions served as the bibliographic basis for Latin binomials authored by Desmarest (1804) , Oken (1816) , Olfers (1818) , and others.

Didelphis paraguayensis is, however, available from Allen (1902) , who used it as a valid name citing Azara's account as its bibliographic basis. Didelphis leucotis Wagner (1847) is also based on Azara's description of his first opossum, so paraguayensis Allen and leucotis Wagner are objective synonyms, and both are subjective junior synonyms of albiventris Lund. Thomas (1888) and Cabrera (1958) thought that Didelphis azarae Temminck (1824) was based on Azara's first opossum, and they used it as the oldest available name for the white-eared Paraguayan species. Although Temminck cited Azara's first opossum as a synonym of D. azarae, his description was actually based on several specimens of black-eared opossums that he examined in various European museums (Wagner, 1847; Hershkovitz, 1969; Cerqueira and Tribe, 2008) . Whether azarae is a junior synonym of the black-eared Amazonian species D. marsupialis Linnaeus, 1758, or a senior synonym of the southeastern Brazilian species currently known as D. aurita Wied, 1826, remains to be determined by examination of Temminck's original material (said by him to be in Paris, Leiden, Vienna, and Frankfurt). In the event that Temminck's syntypes should all prove to be from southeastern Brazil, we recommend that azarae be suppressed in order to maintain current usage (Gardner, 1993 (Gardner, , 2005 Cerqueira and Tribe, 2008) .",

Because Olfers explicitly based lanatus on Azara's (1801) description of the ''Micour\u00e9 second,'' and because Azara stated that he had seen but a single example, the Madrid specimen is the holotype by monotypy.

Neither locality is mentioned in the Apuntamientos, however, where the species is simply said to occur in Paraguay and Buenos Aires. Several nominal subspecies of Lutreolina crassicaudata have been recognized by authors within the Spanish territory traversed by Azara, including (in addition to the nominotypical form), L. c. bonaria Thomas, 1923 (with type locality near Buenos Aires); L. c. lutrilla Thomas, 1923 (with type locality in Rio Grande do Sul, but ranging into Uruguay); and L. c. paranalis Thomas, 1923 (with type locality in the Argentine province of Santa F\u00e9). All of these are currently treated (e.g., by Gardner, 2005; Stein and Patton, 2008) as synonyms of L. c. crassicaudata, but in the event that any are subsequently recognized as valid taxa, it might be desirable to fix the application of crassicaudata by neotype selection. Given the widespread assumption that the nominotypical form is the one that occurs in Paraguay (Thomas, 1923; Cabrera, 1958; Xim\u00e9nez, 1967) , it would be appropriate to designate a neotype from that country.

According to Tate (1933: 218) , this locality is ''Tapua . . . some few miles northeast of Asuncion,'' which would put it in the Paraguayan department of Central. Gardner (2005: 17) , however, stated that ''Tapu\u00e1 '' (with an acute accent on the terminal vowel) is in Departamento Presidente Hayes. The geographic discrepancy is significant because the departments of Central and Presidente Hayes lie on opposite banks of the R\u00edo Paraguay, which divides the country into two ecologically and zoogeographically distinct parts (Myers, 1982) : the Eastern Region and the Chaco ( fig. 3) . Fortunately, Azara's posthumously published treatise on the geography of Paraguay (Azara, 1904 ; edited by R.R. Schuller) makes it clear that Don Josef's house (in the viceparroquia of Tap\u00fa a, not Tapu\u00e1 ) was in the Eastern Region not far from the left bank of the R\u00edo Paraguay.",

In fact, Azara's description has been stretched to fit several other small didelphids. Thomas (1888) , for example, identified Azara's Micour\u00e9 \u00e0 queue longue with the species currently known as Marmosops incanus, for which he used the name Didelphys (Micoureus) grisea Desmarest. Later (Thomas, 1894), he changed his mind and used the name Micoureus griseus for a specimen of Thylamys collected in Corrientes, Argentina. After discovering the priority of Oken's name, Thomas (1896) used Marmosa marmota for what he believed to be the same species in Paraguay and Corrientes, but he subsequently (Thomas, 1912) designated one of his Corrientes specimens as the type of Marmosa citella, a new species. Currently, citella is regarded (e.g., by Gardner, 2005; Creighton and Gardner, 2008) as a junior synonym of Thylamys pusillus (Desmarest, 1804) , a name based on Azara's sixth opossum (see below). Tate (1933) used the name Marmosa marmota marmota (Oken) for the large Thylamys that occurs in eastern Paraguay, but he also recognized a smaller form in the Chaco that he identified as M. marmota verax Thomas (1921) . Cabrera (1958) used Marmosa (Thylamys) grisea (Desmarest) for the taxon that Tate (1933) called M. marmota marmota and referred verax to the synonymy of M. (T.) pusilla. As if the situation were not sufficiently confusing by this time, Hershkovitz (1959) argued-not without reason (see below)-that Azara's fourth and sixth opossums were conspecific and used the name M. pusilla (Desmarest, 1804) for both. However, Kirsch and Calaby (1977) recognized M. (T.) grisea and M. (T.) pusilla as valid species based on Azara's fourth and sixth opossums, respectively. Current usage of the binomen Thylamys macrurus dates from Gardner and Creighton (1989) .",

We therefore select as neotype of Thylamys macrurus (Olfers, 1818) an adult female specimen in the University of Michigan Museum of Zoology (UMMZ 125243), consisting of a skin and skull collected by Thomas W. Nelson (original number TWN 103) at 28 km SW Pedro Juan Caballero (22u349S, 55u379W) in Departamento Amambay, Paraguay, on 9 February 1977. Based on this specimen and Fig. 3 . Map of collecting localities for examined Paraguayan specimens of Thylamys (numbers correspond to gazetteer entries in the appendix). Some adjacent Brazilian and Bolivian collecting localities are also mapped, but not all of those listed in the gazetteer are shown. The locations of Paraguayan towns mentioned in Azara's opossum accounts are also indicated; coordinates of most of these can be found in standard gazetteers (e.g., DMA, 1992) , but the location of Tap\u00fa a is based on a map in Frakes (1989) .

Such uncertainties could obviously be resolved by neotype selection, but we have not made a close study of these taxa, and it seems irresponsible to take such action without having seen all of the relevant type material. Furthermore, the names sorex and dimidiata are now widely used, and no biological purpose would be served by replacing either with brevicaudis. Therefore, another defensible option would be to petition the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature to use its plenary powers to suppress brevicaudis, which has only been used as a valid name by a few authors (e.g., Hershkovitz, 1959; Wetzel and Lovett, 1974; Brown, 2004) . Although the latter course of action would effectively conserve current binomial usage (Gardner, 2005; Pine and Handley, 2008) , it is possible that Paraguayan populations of red-flanked Monodelphis are taxonomically distinct from other named forms and would then need a new name. Only careful revisionary work based on first-hand examination of types and other relevant specimens can establish the appropriate action to take in this matter.",

The tail is bicolored proximally (dark above, whitish below), but the terminal one-fifth to one-third is entirely white. The ventral surface of the tail is modified for prehension distally, with a naked median groove and a fleshy apical pad bearing dermatoglyphs. The body pelage is distinctly tricolored (sensu Tate, 1933: 209) , with a dark grayish or grayish-brown middorsal region, paler flanks, and sharply defined ventral countershading. The dorsal fur is short (usually 8-9 mm long middorsally), and the ventral fur is mostly self-white or -cream from chin to anus; however, a narrow lateral zone of gray-based hairs is usually present. The manual claws are short (not, or only slightly extending beyond the fleshy apical pad of each digit), and the ventral surface of the manus has six separate dermatoglyph-bearing plantar pads encircling a concave, densely tubercular central palmar region. The supraorbital margins are indistinctly beaded in large specimens, some of which (e.g., MZUSP 32094) have indistinct postorbital processes. The zygomatic arches are wide relative to cranial length (the average ratio of zygomatic breadth to condylobasal length expressed as a percentage [ZB/CBL 3 100] is about 56%). Distinct maxillary palatal vacuities are invariably present, although these openings are some- times small. The posterolateral palatal foramina usually extend anteriorly to a point that is lingual to the M4 protocones, but they are not as long as in most other congeneric species (Carmignotto and Monfort, 2006: fig. 6 ). The auditory bullae are relatively small, the distance between the left and right bullae greatly exceeding the width of either bulla. Stylar cusp C is consistently present on M1-M3. COMPARISONS: The known geographic range of Thylamys macrurus is adjacent to the distributions of three congeneric species, with which it merits brief comparisons. The smaller Brazilian species T. karimii and T. velutinus differ from T. macrurus (among other characters) by having longer claws that extend well beyond the fleshy apical pads of the manual digits; manual plantar pads are fused together and do not surround a central palmar concavity; a tail that is substantially shorter than the combined length of head and body; no prehensile modifications on the underside of the tail tip; indistinctly tricolored body pelage; and much longer posterolateral palatal foramina (see illustrations in Carmignotto and Monfort, 2006) . Both species occur in Cerrado (T. velutinus) or Cerrado and Caatinga (T. karimii) landscapes that are drier and more seasonal than those inhabited by T. macrurus in eastern Paraguay and Mato Grosso do Sul. Thylamys pusillus, the only other species of Thylamys known to occur in Paraguay, differs from T. macrurus by being substantially smaller (with nonoverlapping molar dimensions; tables 2, 3), by lacking a pale tail tip, by its entirely self-white ventral fur (lacking lateral zones of gray-based hairs), by having much longer posterolateral palatal foramina, and by usually lacking styC on M3. Based on specimens that we examined ( fig. 3 ), the ranges of T. pusillus and T. macrurus are separated by the R\u00edo Paraguay and by the seasonally innundated pantanales (palm savannas) of the eastern Chaco.",

                "text": "SPECIMENS EXAMINED: Brazil-Mato Paraguay and southeastern Bolivia. With exceptions as noted below, specimens previously reported in the literature as T. pusillus that we examined from other regions proved to be misidentified. Records of T. pusillus from the Bolivian highlands (e.g., most of the material that Anderson [1997] listed from Chuquisaca), for example, are based on T. venustus, whereas Brazilian records (e.g., those mapped by Brown [2004] are based on T. karimii, and Patagonian records (e.g., those reported by Birney et al., 1996) are based on T. pallidior. Although T. pusillus might occur in the Chaco Austral of northern Argentina (Flores et al., 2000 (Flores et al., , 2007 , the specimens that we examined from that region differ morphologically from Paraguayan and Bolivian material and might represent yet another species (see below). Thylamys pusillus is found in xerophytic woodlands that are dominated by low (usually ,15 m), thorny, deciduous trees including quebracho, palo santo, palo borracho, and lab\u00f3 n (Tabebuia nodosa). The understory typically includes algarrobo (Prosopis spp.), Maytenus spp., Mimosa spp., Ephedra spp., and several species of cacti. Dense patches of spiny bromeliads (caraguat\u00e1: Bromelia hieronymi, B. serra) provide groundcover that is nearly impenetrable to mammalian or avian predators. Short (1975: 173) referred to these forests as ''dry (Algarrobo-Quebracho-Palo Santo) woodlands'' and provided a detailed description and photographs of this uniquely Chacoan habitat. EMENDED DIAGNOSIS: Thylamys pusillus exhibits a distinctive range of morphometric variation (table 3) and differs from other congeneric species in many qualitative traits. The tail, consistently longer than the combined length of the head and body (by about 14-16%), is distinctly incrassate, sharply bicolored (dark above, whitish below), and the ventral surface is modified for prehension distally (with a naked median groove and a fleshy apical pad bearing dermatoglyphs). The body pelage is distinctly tricolored (sensu Tate [1933: 209] ), with a dark grayish or brownish-gray middorsal region, paler flanks, and sharply defined ventral countershading. The dorsal fur is short (usually 7-8 mm long middorsally), and the ventral fur is entirely self-white or -cream (not gray based) from chin to anus. The manual claws are short (not, or only slightly extending beyond the fleshy apical pad of each digit), and the ventral surface of the manus has six separate dermatoglyph-bearing plantar pads encircling a concave, densely tubercular central palmar region. The zygomatic arches are wide relative to cranial length (the average ratio of zygomatic breadth to condylobasal length 3 100 is about 55%-56%); distinct maxillary palatal vacuities are almost always present; the posterolateral palatal foramina are very long (extending well anterior to the protocone of M4 on each side); the auditory bullae are relatively small by comparison with those of other species; and styC is usually present on M1 and M2, but it is usually absent from M3.",

                "text": "Thylamys pusillus with T. macrurus have already been discussed. The Brazilian species T. karimii (synonymized with T. pusillus by Gardner, 1993) is craniodentally similar but differs from T. pusillus by having longer claws that extend well beyond the fleshy apical pads of the manual digits; manual plantar pads that are fused together, lack dermatoglyphs, and do not surround a central palmar concavity; a tail that is substantially shorter than the combined length of head and body; no prehensile modifications on the underside of the tail tip; and indistinctly tricolored body pelage (see illustrations in Carmignotto and Monfort, 2006) . Geographically, T. karimii is endemic to the Cerrado and Caatinga biomes north and east of the Chacoan region inhabited by T. pusillus. Thylamys pallidior (treated as a subspecies of T. pusillus by Cabrera, 1958) differs externally from T. pusillus by its much longer fur (usually .10 mm middorsally) and longer manual claws (which always extend beyond the fleshy apical pad of each digit). Cranially, T. pallidior differs from T. pusillus by its longer and more slender rostrum, narrower zygomatic arches, much larger bullae, and by the consistent absence of maxillary fenestrae ( fig. 5) . A diagnostic dental difference consists in the absence of stylar cusp C from M1-M3 in T. pallidior, whereas styC is consistently present on M1 and M2 in T. pusillus. Based on material that we examined, Thylamys pallidior (which may represent a complex of two or more morphologically similar species; Braun et al., 2005) occurs from south-central Peru (on the west side of the Andes; Solari, 2003) across the Bolivian highlands into northwestern and Patagonian Argentina; apparently, it occupies a wide range of arid habitats including Puna grasslands, Monte desert, and Patagonian steppe (Flores et al., 2000 (Flores et al., , 2007 .",

However, our cursory examination of the holotype (BMNH 98.8.19.9) during a brief visit to London that was primarily devoted to another project did not allow us to come to a definite conclusion, nor do our notes contain information about several key characters (such as the presence or absence of styC on the upper molars). The chief difficulty in admitting this synonymy is that the type locality of citella (Goya, at 29u089S, 59u169W; Paynter, 1995) in the Argentine province of Corrientes is so distant from any others from which we have seen similar material.",

In addition, styC is more consistently distinct on M3 in pusillus-like Argentinian specimens than it is in Paraguayan and Bolivian material. Among the small, pusillus-like Argentinian specimens we examined is BMNH 21.4.21.8, the subadult male holotype of Marmosa bruchi, which Thomas (1921) described from Alto Pencoso (33u269S, 66u569W; Paynter, 1995) in western San Luis province. Although bruchi is currently considered a synonym of T. pallidior (e.g., by Gardner, 2005; Creighton and Gardner, 2008) , its short fur, distinct maxillary vacuities, and well-developed styC on M1 and M2 better match the diagnostic traits of T. pusillus as recognized here.

Although we are encouraged to think that bruchi may be a valid species of Thylamys, closely related to but phenotypically and genetically distinct from T. pusillus, it remains for future researchers to determine whether there is a gradual or abrupt morphological transition from the small Argentinian phenotype to the larger Paraguayan-Bolivian phenotype, and to discover whether specimens sorted by size form reciprocally monophyletic haplotype groups.",

Among others, the continental fauna remains incompletely inventoried; the geographic, morphological, and genetic limits of numerous species are still undocumented; and the taxonomic application of many old names is a persistent source of confusion. In the absence of surviving original material (holotypes, syntypes, etc.), the last problem has often been addressed by restricting the type locality (as by Thomas, 1911; Cabrera, 1958) and examining ''topotypes,'' but neither of these conventions, however useful they might be in practice, have any binding nomenclatural significance under the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN, 1999) . A better option, when it is necessary to fix the application of names, and when the consequences of failing to doing so are dire, is the designation of neotypes. Like sharp-edged tools, however, neotypes are potent instruments that should be used with care.",

Also, the basis for some of the Paraguayan bats described by Geoffroy (1810), including Platyrrhinus lineatus and Sturnira lilium, is controversial: whereas Hershkovitz (1987) claimed that these binomens were based on Azara's (1801) text, other authors (e.g., Rode, 1941; Carter and Dolan, 1978; S\u00e1nchez-Hern\u00e1 ndez and Romero-Almaraz, 2003; Velasco, 2005) have alleged that type material (not collected by Azara according to Cabrera, 1958 ) is present in the Mus\u00e9um National d'Histoire Naturelle (Paris).

Unhelpfully, Azara said that he measured the tail in the same way that he measured total length, leaving the interpretation of this important dimension somewhat ambiguous for lack of a definite anterior endpoint. Because Azara's qualitative descriptions are limited to behavioral and external-morphological traits, his measurements of the upper jaw (''mandibula superior'') are puzzling anomalies. On the assumption that this dimension was not obtained from osteological preparations, we tried to replicate his reported values using externally visible features of museum specimens in various ways. The best matches we obtained suggest that he measured the upper jaw across the bases of the left and right canine teeth. On the same assumption, his measurements of the canine were probably made from the gumline (not the bony alveolar margin) to the apex of the tooth.",

''On the 13th of December I was brought a female with 14 cubs, dead or moribund, of hurts given them upon capture and afterward. Nevertheless, placing them near the teats, the two hardiest pups took the teats; but the mother starting to run about, they could not continue [suckling] from their weakness, dying on the third day. There were something like eight that had been born, according to those who chased the mother [another female?] at that time without being able to catch her; and they said, that the young dragged on the ground as the mother ran without loosening their hold on the teats. When I saw them they were naked, blind, and 1K inches long, without the tail of 4 lines [9 mm]. They were found with the mother in a swampy patch of tall grass (''pajonal del campo''); and having hidden in a hole in the ground, it was flooded with water, making her leave and run with the young dragging along, as they were when they went in the hole, because she never left them behind. She did not have a pouch; but one could see between the hind legs a swollen udder, that encroached a little toward the belly; and in this were 14 teats, so small that one could hardly count them. The milk dried up several days after the death of the young, at which time it was necessary to use a magnifying glass to see the teats. I did not notice a bad smell as I did in the male. Her length was 6 4/5 inches [184 mm]: the tail 2 inches [54 mm]. The bright cinnamon color of the male was only seen on the sides of the head and of the neck, because the sides of the body were made grizzled brown (''pardeaba'') by being blended with the grayish color of the back. The underparts were a lighter cinnamon (''bayas acaneladas'') or whitish cinnamon (''acaneladas blanquizcas'').'' Of the Enano I don't know another name that suits it better, nor have I had but two identical males, which were sold to me on different days in October by Indians of San Ignacio G\u00fc az\u00fa , saying that they had caught them in their huts. Length 7 inches [190 mm] : tail 3 b inches [99 mm], all naked, and somewhat more slender in proportion to that of the Colilargo. The ear is quite upright and rounded, 6 lines [14 mm] high and 4 lines [9 mm] wide. The whiskers are much finer than those of the common little mouse, and the testicles pendant and a little loose in the scrotum.
