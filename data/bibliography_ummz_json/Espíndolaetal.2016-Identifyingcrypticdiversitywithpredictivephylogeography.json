    "abstract": "Identifying units of biological diversity is a major goal of organismal biology. An increasing literature has focused on the importance of cryptic diversity, defined as the presence of deeply diverged lineages within a single species. While most discoveries of cryptic lineages proceed on a taxon-by-taxon basis, rapid assessments of biodiversity are needed to inform conservation policy and decision-making. Here, we introduce a predictive framework for phylogeography that allows rapidly identifying cryptic diversity. Our approach proceeds by collecting environmental, taxonomic and genetic data from codistributed taxa with known phylogeographic histories. We define these taxa as a reference set, and categorize them as either harbouring or lacking cryptic diversity. We then build a random forest classifier that allows us to predict which other taxa endemic to the same biome are likely to contain cryptic diversity. We apply this framework to data from two sets of disjunct ecosystems known to harbour taxa with cryptic diversity: the mesic temperate forests of the Pacific Northwest of North America and the arid lands of Southwestern North America. The predictive approach presented here is accurate, with prediction accuracies placed between 65% and 98.79% depending of the ecosystem. This seems to indicate that our method can be successfully used to address ecosystemlevel questions about cryptic diversity. Further, our application for the prediction of the cryptic/non-cryptic nature of unknown species is easily applicable and provides results that agree with recent discoveries from those systems. Our results demonstrate that the transition of phylogeography from a descriptive to a predictive discipline is possible and effective.",

The discovery of biodiversity can be impeded by the presence of cryptic diversity [2] , where deep genetic divergence within a nominal species is present but not accompanied by known fixed morphological differences between sets of populations. Several factors have stimulated a growing literature that discusses the importance of such cryptic diversity. First, the prioritization of conservation efforts on a regional scale is often determined by species richness and endemism, and the identification of cryptic diversity is critical to estimating these parameters [3, 4] . Second, the discovery of cryptic diversity establishes evolutionarily significant units for conservation [5, 6] . Third, the discovery of cryptic diversity is critical to understanding anthropogenic biotic changes, invasions and ecosystem health [7] . Thus, cryptic diversity is a vital component of biological diversity [8, 9] , and its discovery is central to documenting fundamental units in ecology [10] , evolution and conservation [2] .",

While the assumptions and methodological details of these methods vary [15] , each conducts lineage delimitation on a species-by-species basis and thus requires a detailed phylogeographic investigation into each taxon. Such investigations are time-consuming and expensive, and these costs limit the number of systems that can be investigated. Given the myriad threats to the Earth's biodiversity [16 -19] and the difficulties inherent to the discovery of cryptic biodiversity [20] , biodiversity discovery should no longer proceed on a taxon-by-taxon basis, but rather, rapid discovery and characterization of biodiversity is needed [21] .",

Cryptic diversity may be predictable from analysis of environmental data [8] , and comparative phylogeographic research has demonstrated broadly congruent patterns of cryptic diversity in multiple species occupying the same fragmented biome [22 -24] . In such conditions, cryptic divergence may be driven by random processes (e.g. genetic drift, mutations) or by divergent selection [2, 25] . Longer periods of isolation are expected to increase ecological differentiation/divergence [26, 27] , and this has been demonstrated in several taxa [28, 29] .",

They posit either persistence of inland rainforests throughout the Pleistocene [30] or post-Pleistocene dispersal to the inland rainforests. The first hypothesis predicts high cryptic diversity, because of the hypothesized old age of the disjunction [37] , and indeed, phylogeographic investigations have revealed cryptic diversity in taxa that were originally described as single, disjunct species (e.g. [33, 38] ; see electronic supplementary material, table S1). The alternative hypotheses deny the persistence of inland Pleistocene refugia, instead positing the inland dispersal of rainforest taxa after the Pleistocene (electronic supplementary material, table S1). Because the latter invoke the recent ( post-Pleistocene) establishment of inland taxa, these recent dispersal models predict a lack of cryptic diversity, which has been shown in some studied taxa [33] . The arid lands of Southwestern North America (SAL) include a series of xeric areas that extend from the Southwestern United States to northern Mexico [39] , and contain the Sonoran, Chihuahuan and the Baja California deserts. Although the area displays strong endemism, the Baja California-Sonoran areas share many species that are separated by the Colorado River and Gulf of California ( [40, 41] ; figure 1a). Geological data indicate that the Baja Californian desert became isolated from the Sonoran desert after the separation of the Baja Peninsula from the mainland Sonoran region. Currently, the regions are isolated by the Gulf of California, an oceanic incursion of around 300 km [40] .",

Alternatively, it has been proposed that some disjunct species were isolated in the Baja Californian deserts and have only recently colonized the Sonoran region; this hypothesis is consistent with the observation of several xeric-adapted species that do not show genetic differentiation between the two areas, and thus do not display cryptic diversity (e.g. [40, 43] ; electronic supplementary material, table S1 [44] ).",

Alternatively, results pointing to relatively young divergence events-i.e. dispersal events-and non-reciprocally monophyletic populations suggest continuous gene flow and, therefore, recent dispersal. We used BEAST v. 1.8.2 [51] to infer topology and divergence times with mitochondrial or chloroplast sequence data for SAL and PNW taxa. A model of sequence evolution for each taxon was selected using DT-ModSel [52] (electronic supplementary material, table S5 and see electronic supplementary material, S1 for more details). The Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis was run for 100 million generations, sampling every 1000 generations, with a random starting tree and strict molecular clock.

Owing to the potential for correlation among these climatic variables, we selected a subset of variables with low correlation (r 2 , 0.7). Thus, we conducted our analyses with eight climatic variables in the PNW dataset (annual mean temperature, bio1; mean diurnal range, bio2; isothermality, bio3; maximum temperature of warmest month, bio5; temperature annual range, bio7; annual precipitation, bio12; precipitation seasonality, bio15; and precipitation of driest quarter, bio17) and 10 in the SAL dataset (bio1; bio2; bio3; bio7; mean temperature of wettest quarter, bio8; mean temperature of driest quarter, bio9; bio12; precipitation of driest month, bio14; bio15; and precipitation of warmest quarter, bio18). These data manipulation steps were conducted in R using several functions from the packages rgdal [56] , dismo [57] , biomod2 [58] and adehabitat [59] . Along with climatic variables, we also used major taxonomic ranks (e.g. classes, phyla; electronic supplementary material, table S1) as input in our classification methodologies. For this, we associated each locality to the taxonomic rank to which the species belong. This coarse approach was developed as a proxy for the incorporation of major life-history traits that correlate with deep phylogeny into the predictive framework. The taxonomic ranks used here are very coarse, and as such, the life-history traits we refer to correspond to very general classifications of life, such as the ability to photosynthesize (e.g. rank 'plant'), or general classes in the animal kingdom that correlate with strongly divergent reproductive and developmental strategies (e.g. 'amphibian' versus 'bird' versus 'mammal').",

RF [60] is a powerful method that can be applied to predicting the presence or absence of cryptic lineages in species that co-occupy a disjunct biome. This machine-learning approach is based on the use of decision trees [61] , which are used to classify and predict the assignment of observations into the response categories of interest, in this case, taxa that harbour cryptic diversity (which we will refer to as cryptic) versus those that do not (which we will refer to as non-cryptic). Each node in these decision trees represents a dichotomization of the data, defined by a condition in one of the predictor variables. The tree is grown (i.e. more nodes are added) with the addition of more conditions, and splitting the data until reaching the tips of the tree, the point where all observations are classified. When new data become available, novel observations can be classified, using the existing classification tree and the vector of predictor variables associated with those data [61] . While in a decision-tree analysis only one decision tree is built, in RF, the original full dataset is randomly bootstrapped and the variables randomly selected, and a decision tree is constructed for each bootstrapped dataset. The conditions contained in the final RF classification represent the modes of the conditions obtained in the full set of bootstrapped classification trees. The ensemble nature of the RF decision trees accommodates uncertainty and biases associated with the classification process that is used for the construction of each individual tree. Furthermore, the lack of distributional assumptions and the use of a subset of variables in each splitting node result in several advantages for classification trees over traditional methods such as discriminant function analyses or linear discriminant analyses (see for instance [62] for a discussion). RF has been applied in ecology [62, 63] , bioinformatics [64] , the health sciences [65] and recently in statistical phylogeography [66] .",

For example, in our case studies, the number of localities categorized as cryptic versus non-cryptic were unequally represented in the dataset (see electronic supplementary material, table S1). In this situation, it is possible that very heavily collected taxa/categories could drive the RF function and bias the overall predictions. Similarly, taxa/categories with few localities could also impinge on accuracy, as they would not contribute very strongly to the classification. To address this concern, we follow the recommendations by Chen et al. [68] and use two resampling strategies to evaluate how dataset balance and size affects the final predictive assignment. In the first strategy, all species in the dataset were resampled to obtain equal numbers of localities per species. Based on the characteristics of the PNW and SAL datasets, we resampled 100 times different numbers of localities: 141, 1500, 4500 and 9000 localities for the PNW dataset, and 1000, 5000, 13 500 and 25 000 for the SAL dataset. In the second strategy, we downsampled the number of observations in the majority category (i.e. cryptic taxa) to the number of observations in the minority (non-cryptic) taxa. To determine the feasibility of using existing data to predict the likelihood that a species harbours cryptic diversity, we then evaluated how the prediction accuracy changed as a function of each resampling approach. All dataset manipulations were done using custom scripts in R (see dryad repository).",

This method is thus useful for predicting cryptic diversity and performs well on different types of datasets. Because the RF method does not have any distributional assumptions [60] , it will be useful in biodiversity questions, especially when compared with other distribution-based approaches (see electronic supplementary material). Interestingly, the error rate in RF is known to increase with correlation of decision trees in the forest [60] , and this behaviour is likely one characteristic driving the differences in the accuracies obtained when the resampling approaches are applied. When the number of localities is small or some taxa are overrepresented, the decision trees are more likely to be correlated, because the same localities may be resampled multiple times (with small sample sizes) and/or the amount of information available will be much larger for some taxa than for others (with imbalanced samplings). Thus, balancing and increasing the number of samples per species directly increases the overall and category accuracies, and diminishes variation in the calculated accuracy (table 1, see also [68] ). By using a combination of RF and resampling approaches, we were able to balance the predictive powers of the two categories and generate unbiased predictions (i.e. very high accuracy in the prediction of both categories). Although the overall results are promising, some predictions disagreed with previous expectations. For example, in the PNW dataset, RF consistently predicted C. armata as cryptic (electronic supplementary material, table S4), and because there was disagreement in the results between the ABC (electronic supplementary material, table S2) and BEAST (electronic supplementary material, table S3) approaches, we cannot properly assess the accuracy of the RF prediction for that taxon. The differences between the two analytical methods may be due to a lack of genetic signal in the dataset, and/or to the fact that genetic data for this taxon included localities from regions absent from the other taxa (see electronic supplementary material, S1 for further discussion). To clarify this prediction, we plan to collect additional molecular data for that taxon. In the SAL dataset, three of the 14 species were not correctly predicted (electronic supplementary material, table S4). However, cryptic diversity in that dataset was mostly defined using previously published classifications by the authors (molecular data unavailable).",

                "text": "The results of the jackknife resampling suggest that our proposed method performs differently in the two biomes investigated here. These differences could be due to either methodological or biological grounds. Methodologically, it can be argued that the set of variables used to build the RF classification functions may contribute differently to sorting lineages harbouring or not harbouring cryptic diversity in the two biomes. For instance, while climate and taxonomy may be very appropriate to capture the differences between cryptic and non-cryptic species in the PNW, they may be less appropriate to do so for the SAL taxa. Using those variables in such a situation could lead to poor classifications, lack of model generalizability and eventually reduced prediction accuracy (see a thorough discussion in [71] ). For this reason, the inclusion of other biologically relevant variables, such as modes of dispersal, generation times, population sizes or morphological characters, may strongly increase the predictive power of the approach, and this line will be explored in future studies. The differences among the results for the two biomes may also be due to biological grounds. Indeed, although the two biomes are disjunct because of an important dispersal barrier, these barriers may not be equivalent. While in the PNW the barrier is virtually continuous and broad (i.e. hundreds of kilometres of unsuitable habitat), this is not the case for the SAL, where the disjunct populations may come into contact along the Colorado River, a relatively permeable barrier. This may have implications for the number of dispersal events and potential for ecological differentiation among the disjunct taxa. A second explanation relates to this: in this work, we used climate and taxonomy as a proxy for the ecology and biology of taxa. This entails the assumption that cryptic taxa harbour ecological differences from their non-cryptic counterparts, and that it is possible to use those differences to classify and predict cryptic from non-cryptic entities. In this framework, it is possible that taxa from the PNW dataset are more ecologically different from those from the SAL. Such a situation would cause the RF approach to be more accurate in the PNW than the SAL dataset. An evaluation of ecological (i.e. climatic) differentiation and niche occupancy in the two datasets provides some support for this interpretation (see electronic supplementary material, S1 and figure S17).",

We assessed three taxa per biome; the three taxa from the PNW (i.e. red alder Alnus rubra, Western red cedar Thuja plicata and robust lancetooth Haplotrema vancouverense) were predicted to lack cryptic diversity with relatively high probabilities (98.06%, 97.91% and 98.24%, respectively). Two of the three taxa selected from the SAL (Costa's hummingbird, C. costae and the desert woodrat, N. lepida) were predicted to contain cryptic diversity, whereas the Gila woodpecker M. uropygiales was predicted to lack cryptic diversity (55.28%, 68.48% and 51.23%, respectively). Interestingly, N. lepida has been recently shown to possess cryptic diversity based on published revisionary data [72] .",

The RF-based approach introduced here holds a great deal of promise for predicting cryptic diversity in biomes where there has been at least some sampling effort, and where other unsampled lineages share those same distributional patterns. One of the direct applications of this approach is allowing the prioritization of additional efforts to discover and describe cryptic species. Further, because our method is computationally efficient, once the presence (or absence) of cryptic diversity of the unknown taxa has been predicted and verified with molecular means, these new taxa can be integrated into an updated training dataset and the RF classification rebuilt. This way, the RF classification is constantly informed when new data for the biome becomes available, which should increase its predictive accuracy.",
