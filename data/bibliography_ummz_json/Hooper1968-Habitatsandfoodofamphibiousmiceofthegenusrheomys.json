    "abstract": "HABITATS AND FOOD OF A1tlPHIBIOUS NIICE OF THE GENUS RHEOMYS Although the known range of Rheomys extends from Colombia to Oaxaca (Cabrera, 1961; Goodwin, 1959), there are few records of occurrence of these mice and little information on their biology (Stirton, 1944). The following notes increase the number of distributional records by approximately 50%, suggest trophic levels of the species, and comment on their classification. Localities.-Four of the five new localities of record are in Costa Rica. These, when added to the previous one (Tres Hios, Provo Cartage, 1350 m-Thomas, 1906b) make it clear that these amphibious mice are widely distributed in that Republic. There are now records for the three principal Cordilleras: Volcanica, Central, and de Talamanca. All of them are on the Pacific slope, in drainages of the Rio Diquis, Rio Grande de Tarcoles, and the Rio Cuacimal, but this almost certainly results from the effort to seek these animals especially in the Pacific drainage. There is no reason to believe that they are not also present on Caribbean slopes. Current information suggests that these mice may occur in most of the small, tumbling, vegetation-protected, clear-water streams in wet montane forest (Hcloud forest\") along the mountainous backbone of the Republic. Costa Rica, Provo San Jose, tributaries of the Rio Buena Vista. The Rio Buena Vista is one of the streams draining the Cordillera de Talamanca that join to form the Rio General, which in turn flows into the Rio Diquis. In July 1962, five specimens were obtained on two tributaries of the river near intersections with the Pan. American Highway, respectively, at 5200 ft elevation, 11 mi. (by road) N San Isidro del General, and at 4800 ft, 9 mi. N San Isidro. David Klingener obtained one specimen in a muddy area about 2 ft from a small pool in the shallow stream at the 5200-ft station. The other examples were obtained at the lower station where the habitat was similar but better developedthe canyon broader, the stream larger, and the vegetation less disturbed. One specimen was trapped on sand and leaves in an eddy of a small stream in a narrow, precipitously walled, feeder canyon. The stream, no more than 3 ft wide and 6 or 8 inches deep, and mostly covered by debris and vegetation, dropped by two 12-ft waterfalls and smaller cascades into a larger stream that drained the main canyon. The larger stream, the bubbling clear water 6 to 8 ft in width and perhaps 2 ft in depth and dropping precipitously frequently, fitted the picture of a montane trout stream. Dense vegetation of tall oaks and other hardwoods draped with tangles of epiphytes covered much of the stream and gave the valley bottom a seemingly impenetrable appearance. Fallen hardwoods and tree ferns strewn with vines added additional tangles. GuyNlusser obtained three examples along this main stream, one on a mossy leaf-littered rock ledge under a waterfall, another at the edge of a shallow riffle, and the third at the edge of the stream. In sampling these tributaries of the Rio Buena Vista we used museum special traps baited with a mixture of oatmeal and oily bits of canned sardines. We saw crabs and aquatic. insects, but no fish.

Monte Verde, the Quaker colony located near the three-province corner (Guanacaste, Alajuela, and Puntarenas) in the Cordillera Volcanica, straddles the Rio Cuacimal, which is one of several streams draining the southwestern slopes of the Cordillera and emptying into the Golfo de Nicoya.

Spring traps were found to be unsatisfactory because many animals died from exposure or severe injury before they could be brought to the laboratory. Two other traps, the Havahart Trap and the National Live Trap, were tried but were inadequate because they had to be baited and set outside the burrows, and the animals did not enter them. Also, the wind frequently released the locking mechanism of the Havaharts and caused a high proportion of them to close prematurely.. . . The prototype of the Cen Trap described herein was designed and built In co-operation",
