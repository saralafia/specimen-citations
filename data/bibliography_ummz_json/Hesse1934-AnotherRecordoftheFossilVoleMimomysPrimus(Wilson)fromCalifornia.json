Coolidge, Jr. Through the kindness of the Mammal Department of the Museum of Comparative Zoology the specimen has been deposited in the Museum of Zoology, University of Michigan. This mouse was found August 1, 1933, by Oliver Allen, a nature instructor, at the camp of the Athens Y. M. C. A., at Tallulah Falls, in northeastern Georgia. The animal was preserved by Mr. Allen, and, through H. A. Carter, was sent to the Museum of Comparative Zoology. The specimen is in alcohol, except that the skull has been removed for identification. The pelage of this mouse is entirely white, with no trace of color anywhere. The feet, tail, and nose also lack pigment. However, the eyes, eye-rings, and outer part of the ears are black. In the house-mouse and in some other domestic animals the black-eyed white character is inherited and it would-likely prove to be inherited in Peromyscus also, if any of these black-eyed white animals could be secured alive.-LEE R.

Wilson described a new genus and species of fossil vole, from the Upper Pliocene of California, under the name Cosomys primus. This was the second record of the occurrence of this group, as fossil, in North America. In the following issue of the Journal (August, 1932, p. 280) Martin A. C. Hinton, noted British authority on the Microtinae, published a note in which he stated that the genus Cosomys was identical with the European fossil genus Mimomu\u00ab.",

This specimen was presented to the Museum by the Standard Oil Company of California, through the courtesy of Mr. G. C. Gester. It was collected by Barbatt from a green shale in a rotary drill core, which had been taken from the \"Crites\" no. 1 well, Buttonwillow Gas Field, Kern County, California. The elevation of the casing head was 298 feet, and the core, at the point from which the specimen was taken, was 3174 feet below the surface.",
