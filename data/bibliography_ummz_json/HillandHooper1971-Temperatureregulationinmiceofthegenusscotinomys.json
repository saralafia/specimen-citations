S. xerampelinus occurs at altitudes between 2100 and 3300 meters in Costa Rica and western Panama, whereas S. teguina occurs from southern Mexico to western Panama, principally at altitudes between 1000 and 2500 (but up to 2940) meters.

It was then weighed and sealed into a metal metabolism chamber, which had been fashioned from a new, quart paint can. The chamber had inlet and outlet ports for air on the lid, and the mouse rested on a screen floor that was raised above the bottom of the chamber. Air temperature inside the metabolism chamber was maintained to within \u00b1 IOC of a desired level by placing the chamber in a temperature regulating cabinet. Dry air was passed through the chamber at a rate of 450 to 480 cubic centimeters per minute during exposure to temperatures between 0 and 30\u00b0C. At 35\u00b0C, the rate of flow was about 630 cc/min. Exposure to a single selected temperature lasted for 2.5 hours except in a few instances noted in the results. Oxygen conswnption was measured continuously using a Beckman G-2 paramagnetic oxygen analyzer in conjunction with the open flow system outlined above. Temperature inside the metabolism chamber was monitored by a copper-constantan thermocouple connected to a Honeywell Class 15 recording potentiometer. At the end of the 2.5-hour experimental period, the animal was removed from the metabolism chamber, and its body temperature measured using a flexible thermocouple probe connected to the recording potentiometer. The probe was constructed of 40-gauge copper and constantan wires welded at the tip and threaded into Intramedic PESO polyethylene tubing (0.97 millimeters in outside diameter). The probe was inserted 2 to 3 centimeters into the rectum. Body temperature was generally measured within 30 seconds of removal of the animal from the chamber. The mouse was weighed again, and the terminal weight is the one reported in the results. Then the animal was returned to its cage and given food and water. It was not studied again until at least the next day. Unless noted otherwise in the results, metabolic rate showed no obvious upward or downward trend during the final hour of the experiment, and the reported rate represents average oxygen consumption over a 20-to 30-minute interval of the last hour during which metabolism was relatively low and constant. Metabolic rate is expressed as volume of dry oxygen, corrected to STP, consumed per hour per gram of terminal animal weight.",

These results suggest that teguina may be able to accommodate to high temperatures better than xerampelinus, although a firm conclusion cannot be drawn owing to the small number of animals studied. There was no evidence of salivation in either species. Knowledge of humidity is important in appraising responses to high temperatures because ambient water vapor pressure influences the effectiveness of mechanisms for evaporative cooling. Relative humidity in the metabolism chamber during experiments at 35\u00b0C cannot be calculated with precision because water loss from animals was not measured. If it is assumed, however, that loss of body weight during an experiment represented only loss of water, the method of Lasiewski et al. (1966) permits calculation of an average relative humidity. This ranged between 10 and 40 per cent for the six experiments performed at 35\u00b0C. These values are likely well in excess of the aemal values for average relative humidity inasmuch as total weight loss reflected loss of dry fecal matter as well as loss of water. On the other hand, relative humidity may have exceeded the calculated values at times if the generation of water vapor varied from time to time (as is expected, since at least urinary and fecal losses would likely be intermittent).",

Experiments in which metabolic rate was not stable were excluded. The thermal conductance of each individual Scotinomys was estimated by averaging the conductances for all experiments on the individual (Table 2) . One-way analyses of variance indi-cated that there were significant differences in conductance among individuals within each species (P < 0.025 for teguina, P < 0.005 for xerampelinus). Estimated conductances for the individuals of each species were averaged to obtain mean conductances of 0.34 cc 02/g/hrjOC for teguina and 0.28 cc Oz/g/hrrC for xerampelinus (Table 2) . A two-tailed t-test utilizing the individual conductances in Table 2 indicated that the mean conductances of the two species are significantly different (0.02 < P < 0.05).",

Kleiber's (1961) equation relating basal metabolism to weight thus predicts basal metabolic rates of about 1.8 cc Oz/g/hr for teguioo and 1.7 cc 02/g/hr for xerampelinus. Our estimate of mean resting metabolism for xerampelinus at ambient temperatures around 30\u00b0C is just 0.4 cc Odg/hr higher than the predicted basal metabolic rate for the species. The metabolic rates of certain teguina at 300C showed a similar approximation to the predicted basal level. It thus appears likely that basal metabolic rates in Scotinomys will prove to be rather typical for mammals of their size.",

Pearson (1960) reported a conductance of 0.27 cc 02/g/hr;oC in Reithrodontomys megalotis weighing 9 grams, and calculation from his data suggests a value of 0.24-0.2S cc 02/g/hr/oC for 12-gram animals. Hudson (196S) obtained conductances of 0.40-0,48 cc 02/g/hr;oC in Baiomys taylori weighing 6.5--8.0 grams. The values obtained for Scotinomys are thus within the range of expectation that might be sunnised from body weight and data on other peromyscines.",
