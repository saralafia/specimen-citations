Surveys in the following years were conducted as part of the National Park Service Inventory and Monitoring Program (National Park Service 1999 , 2001 ) to develop a comprehensive list of the mammals occurring in the park, to gather basic information on their conservation status, and to establish a basis for future management efforts (Rickart and Robson 2005) . Herein we provide a comprehensive summary of available information on the mammals of Great Basin National Park based on a review of published records, historical museum MONOGRAPHS OF THE WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST [Volume 4 specimens, and our recent field surveys. We discuss the present-day fauna in the context of historical biogeography and the Quaternary fossil record of the region. We also conduct a comparative analysis of records from the early MVZ surveys with results from our surveys to investigate historical changes in local mammal communities during the past 70 years. Finally, we discuss factors relating to long-term management of biodiversity in the park.",

As with most mountain ranges of the Great Basin, the Snake Range is oriented along a north-south axis. It is divided into northern and southern segments by Sacramento Pass (elevation 2180 m). Because the drainage divide is nearer the western flank, the transverse profile of the range is asymmetric: the western flank is steep and lacks foothills, whereas the eastern slope is less abrupt and has extensive foothills. The range exhibits a nearly complete stratigraphic series of early Cambrian to Pennsylvanian rocks (principally shale, limestone, dol omite, and quartzite). Orogeny involved initial thrust-faulting during the late Mesozoic or early Tertiary, followed by granitic intrusion and subsequent faulting in the middle and late Tertiary. During the Pleistocene, glaciers developed at higher elevations along with a pluvial lake in adjacent Spring Valley. Quaternary deposits of sand and gravel have formed alluvial fans in association with stream channels on the eastern and western flanks of the range (Drewes 1958) .",

During the Pleistocene, cycles of climate change in the Great Basin caused elevational shifts in vegetation (Grayson 1993) . Presumably, this produced cycles of relative connectivity and isolation between highland areas, with resultant episodes of colonization and localized extirpation in the mountain systems of this region. Throughout the Holocene, these mountains remained habitat islands, sustaining plant and animal populations largely isolated from each other by intervening arid lowlands. As a result, mountain ranges in relatively close proximity may support very distinctive biotas. This is certainly true for the nonvolant mammal faunas, in which many taxa have very uneven distributions across neighboring mountain systems (Lawlor 1998 , Rickart 2001 .",

This is the same general approach used in early regional surveys (Hall 1946 (Hall , 1981 . We used a mixture of snap traps (Museum Special and Victor rat traps), Sherman live traps, and Macabee gopher traps to capture small mammals. Small shrews were principally captured in pitfall traps constructed from aluminum beverage cans (Rickart and Heaney 2001) . Separate trap lines of 5-50 traps were placed in areas of relatively uniform habitat and were operated for 3-5 consecutive nights. Traps were placed in runways, beside fallen logs, by burrow openings, or in other locations with signs of small mammal activity, and were baited with a mixture of oatmeal and peanut butter (snap traps) or mixed bird seed (live traps). Pitfall traps were not baited, but over time, captured insects probably increased the traps' effectiveness for capturing shrews. All traps were examined each morning and late afternoon. Relative trapping effort was measured as cumulative trap-nights (1 trap-night equaling 1 trap set for 24 hours). Live-trapped animals were marked and released at the point of capture after positive species identification. Animals captured in snap traps were prepared as voucher specimens and are housed at UMNH and at the Field Museum, Chicago, Illinois (FMNH). Identifications of specimens at FMNH and UMNH were verified by the authors. Taxonomic nomenclature follows Wilson and Reeder (2005) . Within the text, elevations are reported in meters.

Because most historical localities could not be located with great precision, our recent fieldwork seldom involved resurveys of precise collection localities. Accordingly, historicalrecent comparisons were made at a broader \"landscape\" scale by pooling data from localities falling within 4 elevation zones: (1) low-elevation sites below 1950 m encompassing sites in the valley floor, foothills, and riparian areas along the lower portions of Lehman and Baker creek drainages; (2) mid-elevation sites between 1951 and 2450 m in the Baker and Lehman creek drainages; (3) high-elevation localities between 2451 and 3200 m in the Lehman and Baker creek drainages; and (4) localities in the alpine zone above 3200 m surrounding the headwaters of these drainages. Comparisons were limited to small taxa (<500 g) inventoried both historically and recently with standard mammal traps (i.e., modern records of shrews from pitfall sampling were excluded because this technique was unknown to early collectors).",

This assumption enabled all species across time intervals to be included in the analysis. Rarefaction accounts for different sample sizes (total number of individuals), permitting the direct comparison of abundance over time (Legendre and Le gendre 1998) . For recent samples, expected chi-square frequencies are based on those from historical samples and assumed the same total abundance. Species absent in the historical time interval were not included in the rarefaction, but were included in the resulting graphs to indicate changes in presence and absence over time. For both bootstrap and rarefaction methods, 1000 iterations generated 95% confidence intervals around mean abundance values of each species. Further assessments were made by comparing the rank abundance of species.",

The only specimen record from the park region is from Spring Valley southwest of Osceola; additionally, Hall (1946) reported a sighting from Baker Creek. During our recent surveys, small rabbits observed in sagebrush habitat on the eastern margin of the park might have included pygmy rabbits, but may well have been young Sylvilagus nuttalli that were documented in this area. We consider records based on sightings or sign records to be equivocal. Nevertheless, it is possible that this species occurs in areas dominated by big sagebrush at low to mid-elevations within and surrounding the park. There is considerable unevenness in the local distribution and abundance of pygmy rabbits, and they are threatened by habitat modification and fragmentation (Flinders 1999) . Late Quaternary records indicate that pygmy rabbits declined with the spread of pi\u00f1onjuniper woodland (Grayson 2006) , mirroring a historic trend of increasing pi\u00f1on-juniper that may, in part, explain the recent decline of this species. Pygmy rabbits and other species associated with sagebrush habitat might benefit from management plans to reverse the spread of pi\u00f1on-juniper habitat in the park (Great Basin National Park 2003) HISTORICAL 11.3 ",

                "text": "American Water Shrew Water shrews are restricted to riparian habitat, usually along permanently flowing streams at mid-to high elevations (Beneski and Stinson 1987) . Although records of occurrence span a broad elevational range, data suggest that water shrews are uncommon in the park region. Despite considerable trapping effort in suitable habitat along several stream drainages, recent surveys produced only 1 record from the upper reaches of Lehman Creek. Past activities in the park region, including stream diversions, extirpation of beavers, and introduction of nonnative trout (potential predators), have certainly affected the riparian habitats occupied by water shrews, causing an alteration of their distribution and relative abundance. Throughout its geographic range there are relatively few records of the Inyo shrew. In part this may reflect the difficulty of capturing these tiny shrews using traditional trapping methods Owen 1980, Rickart and Heaney 2001) . However, a single specimen of this poorly known species was collected in July 2000 along the south fork of Lehman Creek at 3018 m (9900 ft) elevation and represents a significant distributional extension about 200 miles into the central Great Basin (Rickart et al. 2004) . This specimen was taken in a pitfall trap in rocky, streamside habitat in spruce-fir forest. Several Sorex vagrans also were taken at this locality. Elsewhere, Inyo shrews have been found in a wide variety of habitats from pi\u00f1on-juniper woodland to high-elevation alpine meadows (summarized by Hoffmann and Owen 1980) . The species may have a relatively broad distribution within the park, but apparently it is uncommon. HISTORICAL RECORDS. Vagrant shrews have been captured in a wide variety of habitats throughout their range (Gillihan and Foresman 2004). In the Intermountain region, this species generally is most common at low to mid-elevations (Zeveloff 1988) , but on many of the isolated mountain ranges in the interior Great Basin, it occurs at high elevations as well (Rickart 2001) . This is true in the park region, where it has been documented across an elevational range of more than 1219 m (4000 ft; Table 1 ). Vagrant shrews occupy a wide variety of microhabitats but are most common in relatively moist situations with abundant invertebrates. In recent surveys the species was Pallid bats are found in a broad range of habitats from low desert to coniferous forest and utilize a wide variety of roosting sites (Hermanson and O'Shea 1983, Anonymous 2004) . Records from the park region represent the northern limit of the known distribution of this species within the central Great Basin (Ports and Bradley 1996 roosting sites but are particularly dependent on caves and mines for hibernacula and maternity sites (Zeveloff 1988 , Sherwin et al. 2000 .

                "text": "The red fox is one of the most widespread and adaptable carnivores, occurring in a great variety of habitats. The species has been widely transplanted, and within North America its geographic range has expanded during the historical period (Larivi\u00e8re and Pasitschniak-Arts 1996) . Although there have been sightings in the region, there are no confirmed records from within park boundaries. In the past, a fox farm was apparently located on lower Strawberry Creek (park staff, personal communication). This, plus the few early records from the central Great Basin (Hall 1946 (Hall , 1981 , have led to speculation that this species might have been introduced into the region. Although animals now sighted may be derived from escaped captives, remains of this species in deposits at Lehman Caves (Ziegler 1964 ) and in Snake Valley (Heaton 1990) (Poglayen-Neuwall and Toweill 1988) and occur principally in the southern and eastern portions of the Great Basin, reaching a distributional limit in eastern Nevada (Hall 1981 ). There are no historical specimen records of ringtails from the south Snake Range; however, there are numerous reports of the species within the region (Allan 2004) , and a park reference collection includes a specimen from Baker Creek (park staff, personal communication). Ringtails primarily occupy rocky habitats at low to mid-elevations (Zeveloff 1988) (King 1983 ). In the interior Great Basin, they principally occur at high elevations in forested habitat (Zeveloff 1988) . None were trapped during recent surveys. However, a small weasel seen near Lincoln Peak at 3414 m (11,200 ft) elevation was probably an ermine. Most of the recent sightings of weasels at higher elevations in the park (Allan 2004) ",

Compared to other chipmunk species, there are relatively few historical specimen records from the region, most being from areas in the north Snake Range. Recent surveys indicate that the species is relatively uncommon. However, given the broad extent of appropriate habitat, it is probably widespread at low to mid-elevations. Among North American chipmunks, this species has the widest geographic range and ecological distribution (Verts and Carraway 2002) . It occurs over a wider elevational gradient than do most other species of chipmunk, but in the Great Basin it is most often found in areas dominated by big sagebrush (Zeveloff 1988) . Near Snake Creek at 2550 m (8365 ft), we found least chipmunks in an area of dense sagebrush, but they were replaced by Uinta chipmunks in immediately adjacent stands of spruce and aspen. Numbers of least chipmunks appear to have declined in the years since the early MVZ surveys; in 1929 least chipmunks were common along lower portions of Baker The Uinta chipmunk has a very broad ecological distribution, but where it occurs with other species of chipmunks, it generally is restricted to forested habitats (Bergstrom and Hoffmann 1991) . In the Great Basin this species has a discontinuous distribution within the forested zones of the major mountain ranges (Hall 1946) . It is one of the most abundant and widespread small mammals in the park, occurring in habitats ranging from pi\u00f1on-juniper woodland and riparian corridors at low elevations to areas at or above timberline (Table 1) (Hoffmeister 1986 ). Historical specimen records from the region are all from areas below 2134 m (7000 ft) elevation. In July 2000 we found it in desert shrub communities on the bajada east of the park entrance and in the Snake Valley north of Baker. These squirrels are common at lower elevations, but principally in areas outside the park boundaries.",

Within the park region, historical records indicate a very broad elevational range for this species (Table 1) . In recent surveys, it was encountered only at sites above 3050 m (10,000 ft). Several individuals were seen near timberline and 1 at the summit of Wheeler Peak, the highest point in the park. This species appears to have declined in abundance since the early surveys. In the 1920s it was present along the Lehman and Baker creek drainages in areas where it was not encountered in recent surveys. Golden-mantled ground squirrels most commonly occur in open coniferous forest; they avoid dense timber and may decline under conditions of increasing tree density that have resulted from fire suppression (Yensen and Sherman 2003) . In Nevada the Piute ground squirrel occurs in low-elevation desert shrub communities dominated by sagebrush, shadscale, or greasewood (Rickart 1987) . Most of the appropriate habitat for this species lies outside the current park boundaries. These squirrels have a prolonged period of aestivation/hibernation that lasts for up to 8 months, and they are normally active aboveground only during late winter and spring. Accordingly, they were not re corded in recent surveys conducted during summer months. However, their characteristic burrow systems were seen at sites in Snake Valley and at the park administrative site north of Baker, areas where specimens had been collected in the past.",

Rock squirrels occur over a broad elevational gradient in the Snake Range (Table 1) , as is the case on several other isolated mountain ranges of the interior Great Basin (Rickart 2001 Although marmots are typically found at mid-to high elevations in rocky habitat such as talus or rock outcrops adjacent to meadows, within the Great Basin region they often occur in semiarid habitat at low elevations (summarized by Frase and Hoffmann 1980) . There are only 2 historical records of marmots from the region, neither of which is supported by a voucher specimen (Hall 1946 ). These include a sighting near Hendry Creek in the northern Snake Range and a reported marmot sign near \"Treasury Lake\" in the southern Snake Range; the latter presumably refers to Treasure Lake, a small pond located immediately east of Baker Lake (U.S. Geological Survey 2004) . Currently, marmots are uncommon in the Snake Range, with most recorded sightings from mid-elevations in the Baker and Strawberry creek drainages (Darby 2004 , Floyd 2004 , Floyd et al. 2005 . Some reports of marmots or their sign elsewhere in the park may, in fact, represent rock squirrels, which are much more common and more widely distributed within the region. The apparent rarity of marmots in the Snake Range, with the predominance of records from what appear to be suboptimal mid-elevation sites as opposed to more typical high-elevation rock outcrops and meadows, is mysterious (Grayson 2006 The chisel-toothed kangaroo rat is restricted to the Great Basin region, where it occurs in areas with gravelly soils dominated by saltbush, the leaves of which are a primary food source (Hayssen 1991 ",

In our surveys, extensive trapping in what ap peared to be suitable habitat failed to detect this species. However, as there is an abundance of such habitat within the park, we believe its occurrence there is possible. (Verts and Kirkland 1988) . In the park region these mice have a relatively broad elevational range (Table 1) Botta's pocket gopher is a widespread species that occurs in a variety of habitats ( Jones and Baxter 2004) . Within the Intermountain Region, it usually occurs in areas with deep soils at relatively low elevations (Zeveloff 1988 ). In the Snake Range and some other interior mountains of the Great Basin, this species also occurs in high-elevation, montane habitat in areas with thinner, rockier soils. Typically, such habitat supports the northern pocket gopher (Thomomys talpoides), which is locally absent (Hall 1946 , Rickart 2001 . Accordingly, Botta's pocket gophers have a broad elevation distribution in the park region (Table 1) ",

                "text": "Food availability is perhaps the most important factor that determines habitat suitability for beavers ( Jenkins and Busher 1979) . There are no specimen records of beaver from the Snake Range or surrounding areas in eastern Nevada, although they have been reported in the Humboldt and Colorado drainages and in the past were abundant in northern Nevada (Hall 1946) . The nearest historical records are from the Ruby Mountains, ca. 150 km NW of the park (Borell and Ellis 1934) and the Virgin River drainage, ca. 150 km to the south in Utah (Stock 1970 ). Beaver remains have not been recovered from any regional cave deposits. Despite the absence of local records, there is direct evidence that beaver formerly occurred within the Snake Range. In 2000 we found vegetated dam terraces and very old gnawed stumps of aspen at 2347 m (7700 ft) along Baker Creek. Old beaver sign has also been reported from the Lehman, Shingle, and Strawberry creek drainages (park staff, personal communication). The site on Baker Creek was dominated by aspen and included many trees with 20-to 30-cm trunk diameters that must have become established only after beavers were absent. Trees in this size range may be considerably older than 100 years (Bartos and Lester 1984, Mueggler 1989) , which indicates that beaver probably disappeared from this site more than a century earlier. This is a strong indication that the species was native to the region rather than introduced for commercial or management purposes. With the development of ranching and local irrigation in Nevada, beavers were apparently eliminated in some areas in the mistaken belief that this would increase local availability of water (Hall 1946) , and such may have been the situation in the Snake Range. In any event, they apparently disappeared before the MVZ fieldwork in 1929 because they were not encountered in those surveys. In 2003 beavers from an unknown source colonized Strawberry Creek near the park boundary, but they have since left this area (Darby 2004 (Webster and Jones 1982) . Regional records indicate they are most abundant at low elevations. In our recent surveys they were relatively common in grass-sedge meadows near springs or seeps at elevations of 1981-2438 m (6580-8000 ft). Specimens also were taken at the park administrative site near Baker and at sites in foothill shrub communities east of the park boundary. These last sites had extensive cheatgrass, which indicates that the distribution and abundance of harvest mice may be increasing with the spread of nonnative annual plants. HISTORICAL RECORDS. Canyon mice are restricted to rocky areas, including talus, boulder fields, cliffs, and rock outcrops, often over a very broad range of elevations ( Johnson and Armstrong 1987, Zeveloff 1988) . There are many historical records from sites at low to mid-elevations within the park region, but few from the southern portion of the Snake Range. In our recent surveys, canyon mice were recorded at only 2 localities in the park.",

Moriah, 1768 -2195 The deer mouse is the most widespread and locally abundant mammal in western North America, occurring in virtually all habitats, from the most arid deserts to alpine tundra (Zeveloff 1988) . Within the park region it has been recorded from low-elevation valley bottoms to areas above timberline (Table 1) (Hoffmeister 1981 , Zeveloff 1988 . Recent surveys recorded them in such habitat at several localities between 2042 m and 2347 m (6700-7700 ft) elevation. However, the species was also documented over a broader elevation and habitat range (Table 1) . In 2003, 1 specimen was trapped at 3249 m (10,660 ft) near timberline north of Pyramid Peak on an open, rocky slope with scattered bristlecone and limber pines. Another was taken at 3261 m (10,700 ft) in a stand of bristlecone pine near Mount Washington. These may represent the highest elevation records for this species in eastern Nevada, and they verify earlier reports of its occurrence at elevations well above the pi\u00f1on-juniper zone (Hall 1946 , Hoffmeister 1981 ",

In 2000 a single specimen of this species was taken in a rock outcrop at 2804 m (9200 ft) elevation.

The cause of this dramatic decline or disappearance at low elevations is unknown. Bushy-tailed woodrats normally exhibit a fairly wide elevational distribution (Rickart 2001 ) but may be subject to heat stress and local population extinction (Brown 1968 , Grayson 1999 RECENT km N, 4 km W Lehman Caves Visitors Center, 2804 m (9200 ft), 1 UMNH, collected 2000.",

                "text": "Long-tailed Vole The long-tailed vole occurs in habitats ranging from semiarid grassland to alpine meadows (Smolen and Keller 1987, Zeveloff 1988 ). It is one of the most abundant and widespread species in the region, occurring over a very broad elevational gradient (Table  1) . In recent surveys it was caught in relatively dry, grassy areas near the eastern park boundary, riparian habitat along creek drainages between 2134 m and 3018 m (7000-9900 ft) elevation, wet subalpine meadows, and alpine tundra above timberline. Comparison of historical and current records suggests that this species may be expanding into low elevations, possibly in response to the spread of nonnative annual grasses. This widespread species is found throughout the mountain west, occurring in wet meadows, forests, and riparian habitat (Clark 1973 , Jannett 1999 . This species has been documented over a broad range of elevations (Table 1) . However, records indicate that montane voles are less common and widespread than are long-tailed voles, reflecting greater ecological restriction to wet habitats (Zeveloff 1988) . In recent surveys, only a few individuals were trapped in very wet meadows and adjacent to streams. Sagebrush voles are generally restricted to areas dominated by various species of sagebrush and bunchgrasses (Hall 1928 , 1946 , O'Farrell 1972 . Records from the region describe a very broad elevational range (Table  1) , from the floor of Snake Valley to 3048 m (10,000 ft) on Mt. Moriah. The species was not recorded during our 2000-2003 surveys despite considerable trapping effort in many sites dominated by sagebrush. Sagebrush voles are colonial, their distribution is highly patchy, and their populations fluctuate drastically (Hall 1946 , Smith 1999 . They may be adversely affected by livestock grazing (Dobkin and Sauder 2004) . Consequently, sagebrush voles might benefit from the recent removal of cattle from the park (Danielson 2000) as well as proposed management practices aimed at reversing the spread of pi\u00f1on-juniper woodland and the loss of sagebrush habitat (Great Basin National Park 2003 Ondatra zibethicus (Linnaeus 1766)",

Animals from the Yellowstone region were used to establish a herd in the Schell Creek Range in the 1930s, and the species subsequently recolonized the Snake Range. There is now a sizable, and apparently growing, resident herd in the park (Darby 2004) .

The species likely was extirpated from the Snake Range during the early 20th century; Hall (1946) reported finding droppings and tracks on Wheeler Peak in 1929 but failed to find any evidence of living bighorn sheep in 1938. The only historical specimen records consist of salvaged skulls or skull fragments (Hall 1946) , some of which may be prehistoric. In 1979 animals from Colorado were introduced into the Snake Range, but the species remains rare (Anonymous 2002b). In August 2003 we observed 1 individual near Mount Washington; occasionally they are seen elsewhere at high elevations (Allan 2004) . The regional herd is almost certainly at risk from diseases transmitted by domestic sheep that are seasonally grazed in the western portion of the park (Danielson 2000) , the principal threat being transmission of Pasteurella pneumonia (Foreyt 1989 , Monello et al. 2001 .",

The regional absence of this species was attributed to prehistoric colonization failure rather than local extinction (Hall 1946 , Rickart 2001 .

In particular, many nonvolant species that elsewhere are restricted to high-elevation habitats are not present. This pattern, which generally is reflected among the isolated mountain ranges of the Great Basin, has been attributed to post-Pleistocene \"faunal relaxation,\" or the selective extinction of high-elevation species (Brown 1971 (Brown , 1978 . Theoretically, the shift toward warmer and drier conditions as the Pleistocene ended, some 10,000 radiocarbon years ago, first reduced and then eliminated dispersal corridors, effectively isolating local populations. By the mid-Holocene (ca. 8000-5000 radiocarbon years ago) when conditions were considerably warmer and drier than they are now, areas of suitable habitat were reduced further to the point that they could no longer support viable populations of mesic-adapted species (Grayson 1993, Grayson personal communication) . The prehistoric record indicates that diversity of mammal species within the Snake Range has been reduced by extinctions since the end of the Pleistocene, and those species that became extinct were closely associated with high-elevation habitat (Table 2) .",

While there have been repeated cycles of extinction among montane mammals, there also have been instances of subsequent recolonization of isolated montane systems (Grayson 1993 , Lawlor 1998 , Grayson and Madsen 2000 . Furthermore, many other montane species such as tree squirrels, flying squirrels, red-backed mice, jumping mice, and numerous others are absent from the Snake Range, despite the fact that seemingly suitable habitat is plentiful. Although some may have been present in the past but have yet to be documented from prehistoric sites, most were unable to colonize the Snake Range during the Pleistocene, even during periods most favorable for immigration across intervening lowlands. We now know that the current faunas of the Great Basin mountain systems were shaped by both selective colonization and extinction (Rickart 2001) .",

There is evidence of ancient fire throughout the park (park staff, personal communication), and prehistoric people may have used fire to modify habitat for hunting or agriculture (Griffin 2002) . Although the extinction of large mammals at the end of the Pleistocene has been attributed to human hunting, reliably dated remains of extinct species from the region are considerably older than the earliest human records, and there are no sites where extinct mammals are clearly associated with human artifacts (Grayson 1993 (Grayson , 2006 . However, the arrival of European-Americans in the mid-19th century introduced hunting with firearms, livestock, nonnative plants, mining, logging, watershed modification, and suppression of natural fires. These activities have had both direct and indirect impacts on native mammals.

Four of the 5 most abundant species in the historical group (Neotoma cinerea, Neotomoa lepida, Perognathus parvus, and Tamias minimus) were not recorded in recent surveys, whereas 3 species (Peromyscus maniculatus, Peromyscus truei, and Sorex vagrans) were significantly more common in recent surveys than in historic surveys. The significant increase in Sorex may reflect greater sampling effort in appropriate habitat during recent surveys.

Analyses of middens reveal that woodrat species may respond to climate change through in situ adaptation (i.e., altered body size and thermal tolerance), or through geographic range shifts and local species replacement (Smith and Betancourt 2003) . However, regional climate change (warming) is unlikely to be a primary cause in the present situation, which involves decline or dis-appearance of both species of Neotoma rather than a shift in their relative abundance (i.e., replacement of Neotoma cinerea by Neotoma lepida). Furthermore, both species are habitat generalists (Smith 1997, Verts and Carraway 2002) and would be expected to persist at many of the more protected mid-elevation sites we surveyed. Although we have no direct evidence, disease of some sort may be involved. Woodrats are hosts for a variety of infectious diseases, including plague (Smith 1997, Verts and Carraway 2002) , and local dieoffs have been reported for both species (Linsdale 1938, Nelson and Smith 1976) .",

We recommend extending these efforts to include beaver (as discussed previously) and porcupine, both of which have significant influences on the broader structure of local communities. The role of the porcupine in the dynamics of midelevation woodland and high-elevation forest communities is certainly worthy of investigation. Management programs usually focus on particular species. While it is logical to target recognized keystone species in this manner, programs that integrate activities within particular ecological communities are likely to have wider impact. An example would be an integrative riparian management program involving beaver, native trout, invertebrates, and riparian plants. Furthermore, management activities need to extend beyond park boundaries to account for the full range of regional habitats and natural processes (such as vertical and regional animal migration). This requires interagency cooperation and, if possible, eventual extension of park boundaries to encompass more low-elevation habitat.

Within the region the species was recorded at sites in Snake Valley and on the eastern slopes of the Snake Range. In July 2000 the species was trapped in desert shrub habitat north of Baker along with the more abundant D. microps. Elsewhere within the park, it is most likely to be found at low elevations near canyon mouths in areas with appropriate soils.
