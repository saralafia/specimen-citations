We address this question by testing two competing hypotheses: the sharp-transition hypothesis and the gradual-transition hypothesis. The sharp-transition hypothesis predicts a rapid accumulation of new species on crossing into a new ecoregion (Fig. 1b) visible as a spike in the number of new species discovered (Fig. 1c) , while the gradual-transition hypothesis predicts species should be discovered gradually ( Fig. 1d ) with no significant change in the rate of novel species discovery at ecoregion borders (Fig. 1e ). We tested these hypotheses using over 200 million point occurrences (including plants, arthropods, birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians and fungi) from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF; Supplementary Table 1) 38 and the most commonly used conservation-relevant map of global ecoregions 22, 23 . We generated pseudo-random sampling transects by tracing a path through 10-km grid cells within ecoregions and across boundaries, simulating a naturalist moving across the landscape at random, and recording the location and identity of species encountered (Fig. 1a) 39 .",

We fit stepwise regressions (f,h) to actual ecoregion borders (solid) and sample randomly permuted borders (dotted), which show either an improved fit of the actual borders over permuted borders as expected in the sharp-transition hypothesis (f) or only a random change in quality of fit between actual and permuted borders in the gradual-transition hypothesis (h). Residuals from the real borders will fall to the left of the histogram of randomly generated residuals for transects supporting the sharp-transition hypothesis (g), while residuals from transects adhering to the gradual-transition hypothesis will fall in the middle of the distribution (i). We also generate full pairwise pixel to pixel matrices (j,l) displaying the difference between the observed community similarity (j) and the hypothetical community similarity (l) generated using geographical distance alone. In this figure, red regions are more similar than distance would predict while blue regions are less similar than distance would predict overlaid with the 'real' ecoregion borders (solid) and an 'average', but random, set of permuted borders (dotted). We then quantify how much similarity in community composition can be explained by knowing where the 'real' ecoregion borders fall. Transects supporting the sharp-transition hypothesis will have more modularity explained when using the 'real' borders and therefore fall to the extreme right of the histogram of possible results (k), while those adhering to the gradual-transition hypothesis will lack distinct clusters and therefore should fall in the middle of the distribution (m).",

We then applied a modified modularity analysis 41 , where we fixed the number and size of the modules based on known ecoregion boundaries and asked how much similarity or dissimilarity was contained in the grid cell comparisons deemed to be in the same ecoregion based on either real or randomly permuted boundaries. At an individual transect level (Figs. 1j-l and 4a,b), we evaluated significance as the proportion of randomly generated boundaries that better explain community similarity (above what distance alone predicts) than the known ecoregion boundaries (Figs. 1k-m and 4c,d). We find that community similarity, after accounting for distance, is better explained by known ecoregion borders for mammals (28.26% (percentage of transects significant at P < 0.05)), birds (22.12%), plants (23.09%), reptiles (18.80%), amphibians (17.70%), arthropods (13.62%) and fungi (9.61%).

As with our tests of species-accumulation rates, we again tested which taxa show the highest amount of community similarity explained by ecoregion boundaries. The results from this approach suggests that ecoregion borders best describe communities of mammals, birds and plants, followed by amphibians and reptiles, then arthropods and finally fungi, differing slightly from the relative ranking of ecoregion fidelity across taxa in the speciesaccumulation analysis.",

Our results give credence to the persisting importance of ecoregions in understanding ecological principles 18, 19 and setting conservation priorities across all taxonomic groups considered 23, [43] [44] [45] [46] . Although the relative importance of ecoregions to different taxa varies by test, in both of our main analyses we discovered that fungi are the least strongly linked to ecoregion borders. This finding adds to evidence that although fungi do follow biogeographic patterns established based on plants and animals 47, 48 , such relationships may be weaker than they are for above-ground organisms 49, 50 . It may, however, also reflect known biases due to the relatively poor sampling and incomplete, or inaccurate, taxonomic identification of fungi compared to plants and animals 51, 52 . Furthermore, separation into functional guilds (for example, saprotrophic, parthenogenic, mycorrhizal) may also elucidate distinct patterns 53, 54 . We similarly find that arthropods are relatively poorly described by this set of ecoregion boundaries, possibly reflecting their small body size and dispersal limitations that would emphasize local-scale patterns over macroecological patterns 55 . As with fungi, we caution that this may also be a function of significant biases in the taxa of arthropods represented in the datasets as well as a general under-representation of their total taxonomic diversity 51, 52, 56 because detailed field studies of insects have found moderate to strong structuring by ecoregion [57] [58] [59] [60] . Based on the results here, we cannot make any strong claims for differences among plants, reptiles, amphibians, birds and mammals, but we were surprised to find that birds, despite their wide-ranging nature, show strong fidelity to ecoregions boundaries 61, 62 . Since our analyses here focus principally on high-level biogeographic patterns, elucidating the mechanisms underlying observed Here, red areas indicate more similar community composition than expected by distance alone and blue areas are less similar in community composition than expected by distance. The magnitude of the colour corresponds to the size of the effect. We then overlay the ecoregion groupings drawn with the 'real' ecoregion borders (solid) or a random set of permuted boundaries (dotted). For ease of visualization we show the heatmaps after applying a Gaussian smoothing function that influences only the visualization, but not the underlying statistics. The amount of community similarity that randomly placed modules capture from 5,000 possible sets of random ecoregion borders is shown in the pink histograms (c,d), with the solid line showing the residual from the real ecoregion borders and the dotted line showing the residual from the random permutation shown above. The P value at an individual transect level is calculated as the proportion of randomly generated boundaries that perform better than the known ecoregion boundaries. This means that transects reflective of the sharp-transition hypothesis fall to the extreme right of the histogram (c) and those reflective of the gradual-transition hypothesis fall in the middle of the histogram (d).",

                "text": "ecoregion borders remains a vital research frontier. In particular, understanding why certain taxonomic groups respond more strongly to ecoregion borders than others remains a pressing challenge. Future work should concentrate on using finer grains of phylogenetic resolution or functional traits that may reveal mechanisms that delineate ecoregion boundaries. Another major gap is quantifying the combinations of abiotic and biotic gradients that are responsible for shaping ecoregion boundaries and, crucially, how they might respond to future environmental change 63 . It is also possible that for some taxa there are sharp boundaries between ecoregions, but they do not align with the maps of ecoregions we analyse in this paper 22, 23 . This point will become particularly important for conservation plans that are constrained to certain taxa or certain regions because we found high levels of variability across taxa and ecoregions in how well they explain species accumulations rates (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3 ). By providing strong and consistent support for the ecoregion concept, these results further our understanding of foundational biogeographic principles 14, 15, 64 and improve their potential application to conservation efforts 29, 43 . Although continuous gradients in environmental conditions certainly shape biological communities, and probably underpin the emergent properties that distinguish ecoregions, our results demonstrate that ecoregion borders represent regions of rapid species turnover. Our findings show how maps of ecoregion boundaries should continue to play a vital role in designing effective large-scale conservation plans [44] [45] [46] in two ways. First, we show that not only can ecoregions continue to indicate ecosystem-level diversity, but that they can also serve as proxies for community-and species-level biodiversity in decision contexts where high-quality data is lacking. Second, conservation efforts that aim to maximize the number of species protected should distribute the areas they protect across a diverse array of ecoregion types.",

Using GBIF data in global models has immense value because of its scope and coverage, but has several limitations. In particular, the data lacks known absences (that is, there are no records of a place where a species is known not to occur), has significant spatial bias in the density of observations and is prone to misidentification of species.

We also removed any point where the margin of error was greater than 10 km (our selected pixel size). The margin of error is calculated as \"the horizontal distance (in metres) from the given decimalLatitude and decimalLongitude describing the smallest circle containing the whole of the Location\" 79 . We also restricted observations to those characterized as: 'observation' , 'human observation' , 'machine observation' , 'specimen' , 'preserved specimen' , 'living specimen' or 'material sample' . The two most significant groups that were excluded for this reason were fossil records and observations with an unknown basis. We finally excluded records collected prior to 1950. It has been suggested that one of the main sources of location and georeferencing errors in GBIF is associated with old collections 80 . Our aim here was to balance losing records from setting a cutoff that is too restrictive (there were approximately 1 million records per year collected in the 1950s) with adding highly inaccurate data. We felt 1950 represented a good compromise between these two competing aims. We used all data points remaining after this first set of cutoffs (Supplementary  Table 1 ); however, we recognize that there may be certain datasets within the GBIF database that were collected to sample a specific taxon within one or across a small number of ecoregions. Therefore, we also conducted a follow-up set of data cleaning, in which we included point occurrences coming only from datasets that spanned at least five ecoregions. We chose this number to exclude datasets that spanned only a few ecoregions, potentially indicating studies that focused on a specific taxonomic group within one ecoregion or across a small number of ecoregions. This reduced the number of points used in the analysis (Supplementary Table 1 ); however, the results were qualitatively unchanged. We therefore present the results that includes all data to increase the robustness of our findings, but we also provide the results stemming from the subset of data in the Supplementary Information ( Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2 ). 22 from The Nature Conservancy's website (http://maps.tnc.org/gis_data.html). However, a new version of the global ecoregions map was recently published by Dinerstein et al. (2017 map) 23 , which we obtained from Resolve (https://ecoregions2017.appspot.com/). Similar to the point data, we reprojected these maps from WGS 1984 to EPSG:3410. We then rasterized the maps with square 10 \u00d7 10 km 2 grid cells. The value of these new raster maps corresponds to the unique identifier included for each ecoregion in the initial shapefile. We then used these maps to plot the transect paths .",

We then subtracted the actual similarity scores from the scores predicted solely by distance. In this method, positive values indicated pairwise comparisons that are more similar than distance alone predicts, while negative values indicated pairwise comparisons less similar than distance predicts. We based our permutation analyses on this matrix, that is, the difference between expected and observed community similarity, which, by definition, is 0 across all grid cells. To calculate the amount of residual community similarity that can be explained by any given set of ecoregion boxes, we added the values contained in ecoregion modules located along the main diagonal.

These boundaries could be reordered so that the number of grid cells falls across the four ecoregions in any of the following ratios: 40-25-20-15, 15-20-25-40, 25-20-15-40 and so on, but never 30-30-20-20.

In the case of the species-accumulation curve, the histogram reflected the residuals of all stepwise functions generated using random boundaries. In the case of the distance-similarity matrix, it represented how much of the modularity of the matrix can be explained by a given set of random ecoregion boundaries. In this type of analysis, the P value is equal to one minus the proportion of randomly permuted boundaries that the known ecoregion borders outperforms. In the species-accumulation curve, outperforming means that the known boundaries have a lower residual, while in the distance-similarity matrix outperforming indicates that known ecoregion boundaries better explain the modularity of the distance-similarity matrix. This allowed us to consider a discretized significant/non-significant threshold for each transect (that is, whether known boundaries for an individual transect outperformed 95% of ecoregion borders) and also a continuous distribution of P values from many transects (that is, the total probability distribution of all transects).

Since plots in the same ecoregion will generally be much closer than those in different ecoregions, we constrained the figure to focus on the region of overlap. We did this by trimming the dataset to only include comparisons that were further away than 95% of the comparisons between ecoregions and closer together than 95% of the comparisons within ecoregions. This allowed us to focus on comparisons of community compositions within distances where it was realistic to have many comparisons between plots in the same ecoregion and plots in different ecoregions.

We show the residuals generated from 5,000 possible stepwise functions derived from random ecoregion borders in the pink histograms (c,d), with the solid line showing the residual from the real ecoregion borders and the dotted line showing the residual from the random permutation shown above. We calculated the P value at an individual transect level as the proportion of randomly generated boundaries that perform better than the known ecoregion boundaries. This means that transects supporting the sharp-transition hypothesis fall to the extreme left of the histogram (c) and those reflective of the gradual-transition hypothesis falling in the middle of the histogram (d).
