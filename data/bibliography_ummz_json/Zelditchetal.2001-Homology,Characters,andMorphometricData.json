                "text": "The use of quantitative shape data in phylogenetic studies has been challenged on several grounds, the most important being that hypotheses of homology cannot apply to them. Two premises underlie that argument: (1) quantitative data comprise a single homogeneous class, and (2) qualitative and quantitative data are fundamentally different. The first premise is problematic because some morphometric variables are constrained to compare homologous features of organisms, whereas others are not. Those that are so constrained, including traditional measurement data, shape coordinates and partial warps, yield features that can be assessed for their similarities and differences, and the resulting hypotheses of homology can be tested for their congruence with the cladogram. Those variables that are not so constrained, including most outline-based variables as well as multivariate constructs such as principal components and canonical variates, may be useful tools discriminating and sorting taxa by overall similarities in shape, but not for discovering characters. The second premise is also problematic because the same logic and methods apply to both qualitative and quantitative data alike. Thus, if care is taken to ensure that morphometric comparisons are framed in terms of homology, there is no barrier to using quantitative variables in phylogenetic studies, especially those produced by geometric morphometrics. Not only are they tools for describing shape differences, they are also tools for understanding the evolutionary history of shape.",

This holds especially true for complex organisms, such as trilobites, whose shapes cannot be described by a few simple ratios. Use of these tools is also attractive for the study of phylogeny, allowing shape features to be described in a precise, quantitative language. However, phylogenetic analyses of morphometric data are highly controversial, complicating any attempt to place comparative studies of shape in an explicitly phylogenetic framework. Further, such obstacles can preclude testing a variety of biological hypotheses that require tracing the evolution of form, including hypotheses about heterochrony or the evolutionary relationship between form and function. One of the major rationales for excluding morphometric from phylogenetic studies has been the claim that hypotheses of homology cannot apply to them (Bookstein, 1994; Cranston and Humphries, 1988; Pimentel and Riggins, 1987) . This claim has been rejected by ourselves (Fink and Zelditch, 1995; Swiderski et aI., 1998; Zelditch et aI., 1995) , for at least some kinds of morphometric data, as well as by other authors (e.g., Rae, 1998) . Considering the central role that homology plays in comparative biology, these arguments demand careful attention.",

A second assumption is that qualitative and quantitative data are categorically distinct. Taken together, these two premises organize arguments about morphometric data, which are often cast in terms of quantitative versus qualitative data. This organization may seem intuitively reasonable if only because the distinction between qualitative and quantitative seems so obvious and familiar.

And the perceived homogeneity of morphometric data would be simplistic if morphometric variables differ from each other in properties crucial to systematic studies. To explore these possibilities, we first articulate how hypotheses of homology are formulated and tested for qualitative data, then tum to quantitative data, asking if that same reasoning applies them. We begin with simple cases, gradually complicating them by considering variation, ontogenetic change and morphological complexity. Initially, we focus on a particularly simple morphometric approach, that of shape coordinates (Bookstein, 1986 (Bookstein, , 1991 . We then review several kinds of morphometric variables, distinguishing between those that use homology as the primary basis of comparison and those that replace homology by another criterion of comparability. We conclude that those using homology as the basis of comparison are suited to phylogenetic studies, and fulfil the promise of rigorous and sensitive tools for the study of shape.",

                "text": "By \"homology\" we mean similarity due to common ancestry, indicated by synapomorphies congruent with the cladogram (i.e., \"taxic\" homology sensu Patterson, 1982) . Characters that are homologous in this sense diagnose monophyletic groups. A different concept of homology often appears in the morphometrics literature, largely because of an important technical problem confronting morphometric studies. The problem is that the concept traditionally applies to parts of an organism, but measurements are typically made between individual anatomical loci. For example, the concept of homology, as traditionally defined, would apply to structures like the cranidium, but actual measurements are made between anatomical points on the cranidium, such as at intersections of furrows. This may seem both obvious and unproblematic, but it involves an interpolation between the sampled points. Some workers in morphometrics have introduced the concept of a \"homology function\" for the function that does this interpolation, and which ostensibly extends the \"point homology\" to regions between them (e.g., Bookstein et aI., 1985) . That function might even be used to determine which structures are homologous to which, in accord with the operational tradition of Numerical Taxonomy (e.g., Hansell et aI., 1980; Jardine, 1967; Key, 1967) . As a result of this specialized concept of homology, it may seem that systematics and morphometrics require distinctly different concepts of homology, in particular, an operational concept is needed in morphometrics, in contrast to the conventional phylogenetic concept needed in systematics (David and Laurin, 1996) . And it may also seem that morphometrics has revived either an operational concept of homology in specific (Donoghue, 1992) , or the philosophy of phenetics in general (Crowe, 1994) . But even if \"homology\" has sometimes been defined differently in systematics and morphometrics, it does not mean that different concepts are actually required by those two fields. The question is whether the phylogenetic concept of homology can be applied to quantified shape data. Some systematists (Cranston and Humphries, 1988; Pimentel and Riggins, 1987 ) and a notable morphometric ian (Bookstein, 1994) apparently agree it cannot.",

Clearly, that conclusion does not rest on a single line of argument or on a single set of assumptions. However, the agreement among authors is superficial because the arguments have little in common aside from the words: \"homology\" and \"morphometric data.\" For example, Pimentel and Riggins argue that the conventional phylogenetic concept of homology cannot be applied to the abstract, simple, vague measurements of length and width, and that ratios are even more problematic because the concept of homology would have to apply, separately, to each dimension. In a different vein, Bookstein (1984) , who takes a very unconventional approach to the concept of homology, denies that the concept can be applied to configurations of landmarks on a curved shape space by virtue of that curvature. And still others approach the issue from yet another perspective, focusing on continuity of the morphometric variables and the assumptions sometimes invoked when coding them (e.g., Chappill, 1989; Rae, 1998; Simon, 1983; Theile, 1993) .",

They are dismissed partly because some objections ostensibly directed at quantified shape data apply equally well to all shape data, or perhaps even to all data, not to quantified size and shape data exclusively (Zelditch et aI., 2000a) . For example, the critique of simplistic descriptions by Pimentel and Riggins can be extended to all simplistic descriptions, whether qualitative or quantitative. Similarly, the objections directed against coding features that overlap among taxa are not specific to morphometric data because overlap is revealed, not caused, by quantification. That argument can be extended to the use of all overlapping features, not just those discerned by quantitative studies. Such arguments are not about morphometric data in particular. The arguments are also dismissed partly because other objections are too specific to bear on morphometric data per se. They concern specific kinds of variables and cannot be generalized. For example, the criticisms directed at using principal component scores as characters concern the definition of those scores; such criticisms disqualify only variables computed under that definition and so are not general (Zelditch et aI., 1995) . And still other arguments are wanting because they focus on matters tangential to phylogenetic inference; they concern concepts or methods not employed in phylogenetic studies (e.g., the arguments found in Bookstein, 1984) . However, even if we can dismiss all these arguments, that does not provide support for the converse claim, i.e., that the concept of homology can be applied to morphometric data. To support the converse, we must show it is strong in its own right, and that is our major objective herein.",

By this we mean that the triangles themselves must be comparable to each other, as triangles, and also that the sides and angles are properly compared to each other. It would not make sense to compare the shapes of Figure 2 because even though two of the points are similarly located, the third is at the anterior insertion of the B Figure 2 . Two incomparable triangles, representing shapes of different organismal parts. A: the vertices of the triangle are the anterior point of the head. taken where the two premaxillary bones articulate at the midline, the anterior base of the dorsal fin and the posterior termination of the hypural bones of the caudal skeleton. B: the vertices of the triangle are the anterior point of the head, taken where the two premaxillary bones articulate at the midline, the posterior base of the dorsal fin and the posterior termination of the hypural bones of the caudal skeleton. dorsal fin in one form ( Fig. 2A ), but at the posterior insertion of the dorsal fin in the other (Fig. 2B ). Regardless of any similarities we might discern in those shapes, we could not conclude that they are homologous. We would not be comparing the shapes of homologous parts. Similarly, it would not make sense to compare the shapes of differently oriented triangles (Fig. 3) . In that case, the vertices of both triangles are located at the same anatomical locations, but the sides or angles are not properly matched. If compared as drawn, differences in shape would be perceived-but the two triangles do not differ when placed in a common orientation. Thus, the first step in any comparison of shapes is to ensure that the comparisons are pinned down by the same anatomicalloci, and that like sides or like angles are matched to like. The second step of the analysis is to compare shapes, seeking their similarities and differences. We can mentally superimpose the triangles, scaling them to a common size to avoid being distracted by differences in size (size can be compared, just like shape, and changes in size might be correlated with changes in shape, but size should not complicate comparisons of shape). From this comparison, we would determine that the data in Figure 1 comprise two A B Figure 4 . The second step in a systematic analysis. A: Shapes are mentally superimposed on each other, revealing a difference in height relative to the length of the base; B: Similar shapes are grouped with each other and separated from those that differ. morphs ( Fig. 4) , differing in the height of the triangle relative to the base (i.e., aspect ratio). That analysis is straightforward, but it involves a combination of observation and inference. Also, it presumes that the heights and baselines of the triangle are comparable, even though we only ensured that the whole triangles and the three vertices are comparable. Thus, we make judgments of similarity and difference based on observations, but such judgments also involve assumption of comparability, and in making those judgments, we require criteria for deciding whether shapes are similar or different. Moreover, in our judgments of similarity and difference, we are postulating homology (for the shared feature) and novelty (for the feature differing between them). Judgments of similarity and homology are intrinsically systematic judgments, not simply matters of observation.",

Organisms often have morphologies more complex than triangles and even when morphology is a simple triangle, shape can differ in more than just aspect ratio. In assessing similarities and differences of the triangles shown in Figure 12 , we must decide whether to look at triangular shape as a whole or to subdivide that whole into individual dimensions. That decision has profound implications. If we view shape as a single unitary feature, we would perceive three different variants in Figure 12 , and code them as three states of \"shape\" (0-1-2). This coding implies the hypothesis that each shape is a homologous feature for the taxa that share it, but no hypothesis is formalized regarding relationships among taxa that differ in shape ( Fig. 13A ). Alternatively, we can treat aspect ratio as one feature, comparing only that among taxa, and then treat the shearing of the triangle as a second feature, comparing only that among taxa. If we take this second approach we would recognize two binary (two-state) characters, one with a derived state shared by shapes Band C, the other with a derived state that is unique to C (Fig. 13B ). The first approach loses information by ignoring the similarity between B and C in aspect ratio, but it reduces the risk of homoplasy because it uses a stringent criterion of similarity. The second approach extracts more phylogenetic information from shape, but at the risk of introducing homoplasy. Given the c1adogram shown in Figure 14 , the increase in aspect B Figure 14 . The distribution of three triangular morphs on a cladogram. Shapes B and C diagnose monophyletic groups. One clade, comprising taxa with shape C, is characterized by an increased aspect ratio and shearing. Another clade, comprising taxa with shape B, is characterized by an increased aspect ratio. The increased aspect ratio is homoplasic. ratio occurred twice, once alone and once in conjunction with shearing. By treating the whole shape as a single character, the two independent increases in aspect ratio (one associated with shearing) would not be misconstrued as a single homologous feature. But given the cladogram in Figure 15 , the increase in aspect ratio occurred only once, followed by shearing. By B B B Figure 15 . The distribution of three triangular morphs on a cladogram. Shapes B and C diagnose nested monophyletic groups. The clade containing taxa with shapes B and C is characterized by an increased aspect ratio; the clade containing taxa with shape C is characterized by shearing. subdividing the whole into individual dimensions, which allows us to recognize the increase in aspect ratio separately from the shearing, we discern an informative similarity. A still more complex example is shown in Figure 16 . Given these quadrilaterals, it is less obvious how shapes should be dissected. One possibility is to describe each quadrilateral as a whole, in which case we would perceive three distinctly different shapes (Fig. 16A ). These would be coded as a single multi state character, 0-1-2, which have nothing in common and thus provide no phylogenetic information. Another possibility is to dissect the quadrilateral into two triangles, right and left, and compare each of them separately (Fig. 16B ), in which case we would obtain two binary characters. Using that approach, we would recognize that quadrilaterals A and C share the shape of the triangle on the left, and quadrilaterals Band C share the shape of the triangle on the right. Still a third approach is to compare the locations of each vertex (Fig. 16C ). Using that approach, each little vector that links comparable vertices has two dimensions, which can be compared separately, yielding four binary characters: (1) the downward displacement of the vertex of the triangle on the left, (2) the leftward displacements of that same vertex, (3) the upward displacement of the vertex of the triangle on the right and (4) the rightward displacements of that same vertex.",

The disadvantage of the first approach, the one using a stringent criterion of similarity, which is applied to the shape as a whole, becomes more obvious as complexity increases. Because whole complex shapes are unlikely to be similar in all details, treating shapes as wholes could produce an uninformative suite of character states. The contrasting approach, i.e., reductionism, also becomes more problematic as complexity increases because it requires assuming that each individual feature is phylogenetic ally independent. If that assumption is false, the results may overstate the support for a clade. For example, had we analyzed each dimension at each vertex of the quadrilaterals as an independent character, we would find two dimensions supporting the hypothesis that the taxa with shapes Band C form a monophyletic group (Fig. 17 A) . Yet, both of these involve displacements of the same vertex. Not only are they phylogenetically correlated but also they describe change of the same anatomical feature. For that reason, even if we begin by comparing the individual dimensions separately, we might choose to recode the two characters as a single one ( Fig. 17B ).",

Even these quadrilaterals are unrealistically simple. In the course of dissecting whole organisms into individual characters, systematic judgment becomes crucial because these dissections are not merely matters of observation. Several recent discussions of character analysis agree on one crucial point: characters are constructed, not directly observed (Mickevich and Weller, 1990; Pleijel, 1995; Pogue and Mickevich, 1980; Wilkinson, 1995) . Wilkinson (1995) suggests that characters ought to represent real units of biological organization. Wilkinson's ideal is somewhat unrealistic because different morphologists, looking at the same organisms, may come to very different conclusions regarding those units. Units could be defined in terms of integrated complexes, or by whether the components are developmentally integrated, or structurally connected, or ecologically interacting. There are numerous possible lines of dissection, and anyone may seem arbitrary (Davis, 1949) . From a historical perspective, units are not arbitrary if they are individual historical novelties. However, individuality and historical reality are not self-evident from an inspection of forms. They are both inferences based on the phylogenetic analysis, an analysis that cannot begin without characters. These difficult, and potentially arbitrary, aspects of character analysis may not be generally appreciated because character construction is rarely discussed in the systematic literature.",

The x,y coefficients of the third point, called shape coordinates, are then computed. All the information about the shape of a triangle lies in the coordinates of the third point in relation to the standardized baseline. When the triangles are superimposed at their baselines, a vector extending between the apical points ( Fig.  18B ) can represent the difference between the shapes.

Systematists disagree, not only because they disagree on how to decide whether morphs are different but also because they disagree on whether overlapping features should be included in phylogenetic studies (see Swiderski et aI, 1998 for a discussion of several views). Considering the subjectivity of the decision, and the controversial nature of each one, plots like Figure 19 are especially useful-they make the basis for any judgment explicit.

Even systematists who oppose differentiating taxa based on subtle differences in average form can make use of the information in these plots, if only to determine whether taxa actually do overlap.

However, quantitative methods are useful in that comparisons can be adjusted for differences in age (or size) and, more importantly, ontogenetic transformations can be compared quantitatively. Ontogenies are often difficult to describe accurately because those descriptions require synthesizing visual impressions of changes in many interrelated features across hundreds of specimens. Using quantitative methods, accurate syntheses are possible as shown in Figure 20 , which depicts ontogenetic changes in the location of 14 shape coordinates in four taxa. Each vector depicts the change in location of a shape coordinate, estimated by regression of shape coordinates on body size. Ontogenetic changes in those locations can be compared statistically by Multivariate Analysis of Covariance, and similarities among ontogenetic changes can be interpreted just like similarities in (static) shape. For example, we would interpret the lack of ontogenetic deepening of the body at the anterior base of the dorsal fin as a similarity shared by Pygocentrus nattereri (and two species of Pygocentrus [not shown]) and Serrasalmus elongatus. In contrast, both the outgroup (Pygopristis) and S. gouldingi exhibit ontogenetic deepening at that point. This suggests a novelty in ontogeny, as well as a homologous feature that can be tested by congruence with the cladogram. Given the cladogram shown in Figure 21 , this feature could have arisen independently in Serrasalmus elongatus and Pygocentrus, or it could be a homologous feature of the clade containing Serrasalmus and Pygocentrus, one lost in S. gouldingi. Despite the ambiguity of the data, the logic of interpretation is clear, and it is precisely the same logic by which qualitative shape data are interpreted. Figure 20 provides a realistic view of the complexity of morphological data. Unfortunately, quantification cannot automatically reduce this complexity. At best, quantitative methods can summarize these ontogenetic transformations objectively and precisely. It can also permit us to decompose those changes into geometrically (and/or statistically) independent morphometric variables. The particular methods used for those purposes have important implications (discussed in detail, below), but the variables are simply that-variables. They can be, but need not be, individual characters. They are decompositions based on geometric or statistical criteria. Conceivably, none of the variables represents a character. We cannot determine how many characters there are in such data from any quantitative protocol because no formal rule translates morphometric variables into characters. It is not possible to generate characters automatically by a purely morphometric analysis because characters are not geometric or statistical decompositions. Rather, they are historical inferences. Quantification, like qualitative anatomy, supplies tools for morphological description, which can be used to describe similarities and differences we perceive in ontogenies of shape. But those tools are not sufficient to discern independent evolutionary novelties. We might dissect the forms of Figure 20 in keeping with ontogenetic correlations over several triangles, but phylogenetic correlations are detected only by phylogenetic analysis.",

But the same reasoning applies to qualitative and quantitative data when it comes to proposing and testing hypotheses of homology. Regardless of the data, we begin by ensuring the comparability of the features, we then compare them to discern similarities and differences, and we then formalize the hypotheses of novelty and homology and finally we test those hypotheses in the context of a cladogram. Moreover, the same three factors complicate assessments of similarity in qualitative and quantitative data alike, i.e., variation, ontogenetic change and morphological complexity. Morphometric studies are partiCularly useful for coping with the first two complicating factors because quantification of shape allows more objective and rigorous description of variation and ontogenetic change. Otherwise, there is little difference between analyses of qualitative and quantitative data. The language of description does not impinge on the criteria by which we judge comparability or similarities and differences, or on the methods by which we infer cladograms from those similarities. Our examples of quantitative analyses using shape coordinates show that quantification does not require a change in the way comparative studies are performed. However, shape coordinates are only one kind of morphometric variable. Other variables might be less amenable to phylogenetic reasoning. If so, there may be real distinctions among classes of morphometric data. In the next section, we consider what those distinctions might be.",

This depends partly on the properties of the raw data (i.e., digitized landmarks or outlines) also on the calculations used to compute variables from the raw data. A variety of calculations could be used, including algebraic manipulations such as extracting principal components.

Outline-based methods invoke criteria of comparability other than biological homology (e.g., a best fitting ellipse for each form with all specimens aligned by the centroids and major axes ofthose ellipses [Ferson et aI., 1985] ). As we have pointed out (Zelditch et aI., 1995) , nothing intrinsic to these methods prevents comparisons like that shown in Figure 23 .

When comparisons are made among incomparable structures, similarities in shape cannot be construed as homologous shape characters, regardless of their distribution on a cladogram. In this case, we can determine that the shape characters are not homologous a priori because the homology of a shape character is subsidiary to the homology of the parts.

One of his arguments is that it is incorrect to claim that outlinebased methods fail to incorporate information about biological homology and so fail to distinguish between fundamentally different object classes. He also points out that outline-based analyses can be constrained by homology, and he also argues that landmark-based comparisons can be absurd because landmarks can be defined by geometry rather than homology. In addition, he claims that comparisons unconstrained by homology might be appropriate in some contexts, like functional morphology. We regard these arguments as misdirected. First, being able to distinguish among fundamentally different object classes is not an issue as that does not involve an issue of homology, just of shape difference. Second, we do not claim that outline methods cannot incorporate information about homology; we only point out that they do not depend on it. Our hypothetical example may seem outrageous, but these methods have been used to compare shapes of sand grains (Ehrlich and Weinberg, 1970) and printed letters (Zahn and Roskies, 1972) , and those analyses do not incorporate considerations of biological homology. The crux of our argument was that the failure to incorporate homology, for whatever reason, is fatal to an evolutionary comparative analysis. It may be possible to infer the hydrodynamic properties of an ichthyosaur by comparing its outline to those of a shark and a swordfish, but it would be a mistake to infer evolutionary transformations from that analysis.",

MacLeod does not show that these classical approaches must be modified if they are to be applied to points. Rather, he claims that geometric criteria can be used to define and recognize landmarks, and that these are not the criteria used to recognize homology. This argument is off target. No doubt purely geometric criteria can be used to define landmarks, but we argued that evolutionary comparisons require that biological homology be the criterion for comparability. That criterion can be applied to individual anatomical loci. The modem evolutionary concept of scapula potato chip chocolate chip cookie Figure 23 . Three shapes that are comparable by outline-based methods: a scapula. a potato chip. and a chocolate chip cookie homology refers to descent with modification from a common ancestral form, which applies to features at any scale, including that of landmarks. Our argument is that similarities in shape cannot be construed as homologous characters (of shape) if they are shapes of incomparable structures. A somewhat more pertinent claim by MacLeod is that the homology of landmarks is sometimes uncertain (Fig. 24) . On the surface, this is a reasonable statement: poor judgment applied to identifying landmarks will lead to inappropriate and even absurd shape comparisons. However, our criticism of conventional outline methods is that they provide no opportunity for systematists to exercise such judgments. Furthermore, the ambiguity depicted in Figure 24 concerns the comparability of the structures on the proximal end of the rib. The location of the landmark in the derived taxa is uncertain because the homology of the novel proximal structures is uncertain. This is not a problem peculiar to landmark-based methods; when the homology of the structures is uncertain, so is the homology of the landmarks on them.",

If the landmarks are closely spaced and pin down comparable segments of boundary curves, then the regions may be cpmparable, just like any region between landmarks. Other hybrid methods that incorporate both outlines and landmarks such as Bookstein's method of edgels (Bookstein and Green, 1993) , are also being developed. No hybrid method has yet been applied to any systematic question (as of this writing) and they all require further developments in software, but the idea of combining landmarks and outlines is promising.

The measurements are comparable when the endpoints of the measured segments are homologous landmarks. The measurements are not comparable when the endpoints are not defined by landmarks (e.g., measurements such as \"greatest cranidial width,\" which may occur at different parts of the organism). Even when endpoints are homologous landmarks, some factors can complicate the assessment of similarities and differences of these measurements. Size is one such factor because lengths increase with increasing body size (even if shapes do not differ), so comparison may require adjusting for differences in overall body size. Size adjustment itself is a complex issue, partly because that adjustment sometimes relies on ratios, which cause problems for statistical analysis (Atchley and Anderson, 1978 ; Atchley et aI., 1976). Also, size adjustment often does not address all questions about the independence of the measurements. Moreover, suites of length measurements are generally less effective for describing shape than geometric approaches. Nevertheless, if the endpoints are landmarks, the comparability of the measurements can be ensured, and the measurements can be assessed for similarities and differences, and hypotheses of their homology can be tested for congruence with the cladogram.",

The method has been described in detail elsewhere (e.g., Bookstein, 1989; 1991; Swiderski, 1993; Zelditch et aI., 1992 ) so herein we only discuss the features of the method that bear directly on phylogenetic studies. Perhaps the most important of these features is that the method models shape change as a deformation, i.e., a smooth mapping of points in one form to corresponding points in another form. The partial warps describe a change in shape, not individual shapes. That is, rather than measuring each shape separately, and then asking how those measurements differ, the difference between the shapes is the object of measurement. As such, the method is inherently comparative. Another important feature of the method is that the deformation can be geometrically decomposed, yielding progressively more localized components (Fig. 25 ). These components are the partial warps. Although they are purely geometric constructs, they provide a basis for describing change.",

Partial warps are purely geometric constructs; the number of them is determined by the number of landmarks, and the axes themselves are determined by the anatomical spacing of landmarks in one form-the one that undergoes the deformation. Their interpretation is complicated by the fact that partial warps at high spatial scale need to be considered when interpreting more localized ones. For example, a localized partial warp, such as that describing the elongation of the postorbital region relative to the eye and snout, must be interpreted in context of a less localized one, such as the elongation of the midbody relative to the head and caudal region. Taken together (as they must be when both contribute to the description of a shape change) the change in the head would involve a combination of the relative elongation of the postorbital region relative to the eye and snout, and the shortening of the head (and caudal body) relative to midbody. Because the postorbital region is part of the head, it is shortened as part of the general shortening of the head (relative to the midbody) even though it is elongated relative to the eye and snout. The localized component describes the change in the head not already described by the component at larger spatial scale, which means that the general shortening of the head 3 . .",

Considering that the reference form determines the variables themselves, that choice could affect the characters discerned in the analysis and thereby affect the phylogenetic conclusions (Fink and Zelditch, 1995) . This is most likely to be the case if individual partial warps are examined one by one, as done by Fink and Zelditch, 1995 because each individual dimension is analyzed separately, and these are determined by the reference form. Only one published study has examined the impact of this choice on phylogenetic conclusions (Adams and Rosenberg, 1998) . In that study, outgroups were used as the reference forms, and four analyses were done, each with a different outgroup and thus each with a different reference form. Ontogenetic transformations were examined, partial warp by partial warp, to determine whether that individual shape variable undergoes an ontogenetic change, following the initial steps ofthe protocol presented in Fink and Zelditch (1995) . According to that protocol, three possibilities are considered for each partial warp: (1) no ontogenetic change; (2) ontogenetic change in the positive direction; and (3) ontogenetic change in the negative direction. Similarities among taxa with respect to these possibilities are hypothesized to be homologous, differences are hypothesized to be novelties. The data are analyzed by parsimony, and the characters are examined for their phylogenetic independence using one of the three tests devised by Fink and Zelditch, according to which features are construed as correlated if two or more variables show the same kind of change (e.g., a gain, a loss, or a change in the sign of an ontogenetic allometric coefficient) at more than one node. Adams and Rosenberg conclude that the choice of reference does affect phylogenetic conclusions. However, they varied both the outgroup and the reference form simultaneously, thus completely confounding these two factors. As a result, we cannot tell whether it is the choice of the reference form, or the choice of outgroup (or both) that affect their conclusions (Zelditch and Fink, 1998) . Moreover, their conflicting results may reflect the sparse phylogenetic information in their shape data.",

In that analysis, we used the outgroup juvenile as the biological reference for all comparisons (although each ontogeny was described as the change from each species' own juvenile). Three other reference forms were also used: a) the outgroup adult shape, b) the consensus form calculated from all the specimens (favored by some workers on statistical grounds [e.g., Rohlf, 1998 ]), and c) the highly modified juvenile shape of Serrasalmus elongatus (included simply to examine the consequences of a poor choice in that it represents a highly derived form and is far from the statistical centroid). Each reference form was used to calculate the partial warp scores and each set of partial warps was analyzed by parsimony twice (holding the outgroup constant), first in conjunction with all the other available data, and second by themselves. The phylogenetic conclusion based on all the data is not affected by the choice of the reference form, but relationships among species of Pygocentrus based solely on shape data are differently resolved depending on the choice of reference form (Fig. 26) . This is consistent with our hypothesis that strongly supported relationships are not affected by the choice of reference form, in contrast to those that receive little support from the data. This issue requires more extensive analysis, especially if there are several equally plausible choices of reference form (such as multiple outgroups). Also, this issue requires analysis using more sophisticated protocols for characterizing ontogenies of shape, such as multivariate regression (discussed in detail below). However, it would not be surprising to find that the basis of comparison, and the particular variables examined, can affect phylogenetic conclusions.",

Nevertheless, the basis of comparison is altered. Because that basis is a function of all the taxa included in the analysis, we cannot compare a subset of taxa according to what differentiates them in particular but rather must use the morphospace determined by the entire sample. Dimensions that might be relevant for a particular pair of taxa may be spread across several components that are trivial in context of the entire sample. Normally, if we are trying to compare taxa with respect to comparable features, we would not define comparability of features according to what differs most among most taxa. Instead, we would define them according to what is homologous. And normally, we are not especially interested in what most differentiates taxa.

Principal component scores (like canonical variate scores) cannot be viewed as homologous features of organisms because a homologue is not a function of phenetic disparity; it is an intrinsic feature of an organism and not conditional on the dimensions of greatest dissimilarity among shapes. While axes of phenetic disparity may describe changes in homologous features, the components themselves are not homologous in their own right and similarities in scores do not suggest homologous novelties. For those reasons, the scores cannot be coded and analyzed like conventional phylogenetic data.

This method presumes that there is a separately measured independent variable on which shape is regressed. In phylogenetic studies, this assumption is rarely met except in comparisons of ontogeny. In the case of ontogenetic analyses, body size is the independent variable and the shape covariates are the ontogenetic changes in shape. Of all multivariate constructs, the shape variables correlated with size provide the most promising data for phylogenetic studies of ontogenetic data. We suspect that analyses based on multivariate descriptions of ontogenetic shape change are preferable to those based on individual partial warps because they are multivariate. Howe.ver, these too must be decomposed to find informative similarities. Figure 30 shows ontogenetic regressions of shape on size for four species of piranhas, highlighting the ontogeny of the body profile implied by changes in location of shape coordinates (Fig. 30A ) and depicted as a deformation based on the thin-plate spline (Fig. 30B) . In this analysis, the four species include the outgroup, Pygopristis denticulata, and three species of Serrasalmus, all shallow-bodied as juveniles. Given these ontogenetic trajectories, we can ask whether taxa undergo similar transformations in shape, i.e., whether these ontogenetic trajectories are in the same direction. This comparison of directions is particularly useful for studies of heterochrony because the hypothesis of heterochrony presumes that taxa share a common direction of change (i.e., the same ontogenetic trajectory of shape) differing solely in rate or timing of progress along it. In this comparison, S. gouldingi and S. manueli undergo considerably more shape change than does S. elongatus (over a comparable phase of developmental time) but these taxa differ in more than just magnitude. They also differ in the directions of change. The angle between the ontogenetic vectors of S. gouldingi and S. elongatus is 41.5 0 , which is statistically significantly different from value of 0 0 , the value expected ifvectors are in the same direction (the statistical analysis is based on a resampling procedure, explained in Zelditch et aI., 2000b) . Not only do S. gouldingi and S. manueli differ significantly from S. elongatus, they also differ significantly from each other, although that angle is only 26.10.",

In Pygopristis, that deepening occurs to a similar extent dorsally and ventrally, and there is no striking regional differentiation in relative rates of deepening along the anteroposterior axis. But in the three Serrasalmus, the body deepens dorsally more than ventrally, and the extent of deepening increases quite abruptly near the supraoccipital process, then decreases posteriorly. Moreover, all three Serrasalmus, even S. elongatus, deepen anterodorsally to a greater extent than does Pygopristis. Ventrally, they either deepen to a similar extent as Pygopristis (S. manueli and S. gouldingi) or to a lesser extent (S. elongatus). S. gouldingi and S. manueli differ from S. elongatus in the extent of deepening, both dorsally and ventrally, a difference especially pronounced in the anterior back, between the tip of the supraoccipital process and the anterior insertion of the dorsal fin. In this region, the ontogeny of S. elongatus is similar to that seen in Pygopristis (even to the extent of deepening). While the (increased) extent of deepening in S. gouldingi and S. manueli is a shared feature, these species differ from each other (as well as from S. elongatus) in the ontogeny of ventroposterior body proportions. The difference between this pair of species can be depicted explicitly, by superimposing their ontogenetic trajectories on the same juvenile shape (Fig. 31) . In S. gouldingi, posterior body depth is slightly positively allometric anterior to the caudal peduncle, whereas in S. manueli, that region is negatively allometric. In the positive allometry of this region, S. gouldingi resembles Pygopristis (in S. elongatus, depth in this region is virtually isometric).",

Such morphometric variables, including traditional measurement data, the geometric shape coordinates and the partial warps, supply a basis of comparison useful in the discovery of characters even if the variables cannot be automatically equated to characters.
