                "text": "By WILLIAM HENRY BURT and BERRY CAMPBELL During the past summer (1933) the junior author spent considerable time collecting vertebrates in the mountains of southern Arizona. A series of six pocket gophers taken in the Pajarito Mountains, near the Mexicanboundary, during this time was donated to the California Institute of Technology and the senior author has subsequently studied these gophers to determine their relationships with the known gophers of the region. They represent a heretofore unknown race which occupies another of Arizona's small mountain masses. Further study was also made of a series of gophers in the Dickey Collection from the lower edge of the oak belt in the Santa Rita Mountains (see Burt, Journ. Mamm., vol, 14, May, 1933, p. 118) . These gophers are here considered to be distinct from the form occurring higher up in the mountains and are accordingly described below. ; interorbital constriction, 6.3; alveolar length of upper molar series, 7.1; width of rostrum, 7.5; projection of premaxillae posterior to nasals, 3.0. Average skull measurements of three males and three females-Males: Basilar length of Hensel, 31.2; nasals, 12.3; zygomatic breadth, 21.9; mastoid breadth, 17.8; interorbital constriction, 6.5; alveolar length of upper molar series, 7.2; width of rostrum, 7.6; projection of premaxillae posterior to nasals, 2.6. Females: Basilar length of Hensel, 29.4; nasals, 11.0; zygomatic breadth, 20.1; mastoid breadth, 16.8; interorbital constriction, 6.5; alveolar length of upper molar series, 6.9; width of rostrum, 6.7; projections of premaxillae posterior to nasals, 2.6.",
