    "abstract": "Four categories of islands in SE Asia may be identified on the basis of their histories of landbridge connections. Those islands on the shallow, continental Sunda Shelf were joined to the Asian mainland by a broad landbridge during the late Pleistocene; other islands were connected to the Sunda Shelf by a middle Pleistocene landbridge; some were parts of larger oceanic islands; and others remained as isolated oceanic islands. The limits of late Pleistocene islands, defined by the 120 ni bathymetric line, are highly concordant with the limits of faunal regions. Faunal variation among non-volant mammals is high between faunal regions and low within the faunal regions; endcmism of faunal regions characteristically exceeds 70%. Small and geologically young oceanic islands are depauperate; larger and older islands are more species-rich. The number of endemic species is correlated with island area; however, continental shelf islands less than 125000 km2 do not have endemic species, whereas isolated oceanic islands as small as 47 km2 often have endemic species. Geologirally old oceanic islands have many endemic species, whereas young oceanic islands have few endemic species. Colonization across sea channels that were 5-25 km wide during the Pleistocene has been low, with a rate of about 1-2/500000 years. Comparison ofspecies-area curves for mainland areas, late Pleistocene islands, and middle Pleistocene islands indicates that extinction occurs rapidly when landbridge islands are first isolated, with the extent of extinction dependent upon island size; extinction then slows to an average rate of 1-2\"/0/10000 years. The great majority of the non-volant Philippine mammals arrived from the Sunda Shelf, the geographically closest of the possible source areas. Speciation within the Philippines has contributed substantially to species richness, perhaps exceeding colonization by a factor of two or more as a contributor to species number. Colonization, extinction and speciation rates differ among taxonomic groups, with murid rodents being most successful and carnivores least successful. In order for any model of island biogeography to be widely applicable to insular faunas, the model must include speciation as a major variable. It is suggested that insular mammalian faunas typically are not in equilibrium, brrause geological and climatic changes can occur as rapidly as colonization and speciation.

This general theory, with its component equilibrium model, serves as a structured set of predictions that allows an investigator to ask biologically important questions. By approaching the topic of island biogeography in a systematic way, investigators are often able to judge their data in the context of similar, comparable data sets, and so may draw conclusions and make predictions that may be generalized over a wide taxonomic and geographic range.",

Some critics have, in effect, stated that the simplicity and rigidity of the equilibrium model have allowed it to be falsified, and that it should be discarded. Given MacArthur's view of a model as \"a lie that allows you to see the truth\" (cited by Crowell, 1986) , this narrow view of the role of falsification may be an inappropriate criticism. The model appears to be most effectively used in much the same way as the Hardy-Weinberg model of population genetics: equilibrium is not assumed or even expected; rather, it is the reason for the presence or lack of equilibrium that is of interest (e.g. Lack, 1976) .",

Although some parts of the theory address long-term processes, most of MacArthur and Wilson's discussion centres on variables that operate over 'ecological time'. This may be appropriate for highly vagile organisms, and for less vagile organisms in a system encompassing short distances, but it restricts the usefulness of the theory. Unfortunately, much of the research conducted with the framework of the MacArthur and Wilson model has utilized species that are highly vagile relative to the distances involved in the study, so that the importance of long-term processes remains problematic.",

These studies also provided evidence that the rate of extinction for any given island fauna is influenced by two major variables. First, extinction is more rapid, and much more extensive, on progressively smaller islands. Secondly, extinction is temporally variable, apparently being high soon after the island is isolated from the mainland, but falling to a low level thereafter. Islands isolated for 12 000-1 5 000 years often have rich faunas in which current extinction is undetectable. Thus, there is little evidence for isolated insular mammalian faunas that are in dynamic equilibrium (ix. that show evidence of turnover). Finally, limited data indicate that speciation may occur within the same time-frame as extinction and colonization, and probably should be considered in models of mammalian species richness (Heaney, 1984a; Patterson, 1984) .",

On this vast continental shelf the proportion of endemics is much lower, and widely separated islands support very similar faunas (Medway, 1972 (Medway, , 1977 Heaney, 1984a) .",

In order to accomplish this, it is necessary to summarize current knowledge of the faunas of the islands in the Philippines because previous summaries are badly out of date (Dickerson, 1928; Taylor, 1934) . T o provide the necessary perspective, I will first briefly summarize the geological history of the area and describe general patterns of mammalian distribution, and then present data that allow direct estimation of rates of colonization, extinction and speciation. I have, with regret, omitted bats from this study; their distributions on nearly all small islands and many large islands in the region are poorly documented and records are widely scattered. Introduced, commensal mammals are not included in any of the analyses that follow. Heaney (1984a) , except that recent taxonomic changes (Jenkins, 1982; Musser & Newcomb, 1983) have been incorporated. Mainland species-area data are those used by Heaney (1984a) , plus data from Harrison (1969) and Lim, Muul & Chai (1977) . Although the faunas of Java and Sumatra are often cited by zoogeographers, there are no current, complete lists of their mammalian faunas; therefore, I have included checklists as an Appendix.",

At the end of the Pleistocene, about 18000 years ago, sea level was about 120 m below Table   2 . the present level (Bartlett & Borghoorn, 1973; Gascoyne, Benjamin & Schwartz, 1979; Bloom, 1983) . It is possible to approximate the extent of late Pleistocene islands in SE Asia, and elsewhere in the world, by tracing the 120 m line around current islands. This method is likely to be generally accurate for the late Pleistocene because 18 000 years allows time for relatively little geological change. Moreover, because uplifting has predominated in the critical areas in SE Asia, we can assume that this method provides the maximum extent of landbridges, and is thus a conservative estimate. A recent review of vertebrate zoogeographic data (Heaney, 1985b) found strong support for the geologically based model of the Philippine late Pleistocene islands shown in Fig. 1 . It appears that there was not a continuous landbridge to the Philippines from Asia during the late Pleistocene. Several channels over 200 m deep separate both the Sulu and Palawan chains from the main body of the Philippines, and much deeper water lies in all other directions.",

Much of the Philippines was tectonically active throughout the Pleistocene, and I therefore hesitate to estimate middle Pleistocene island connections from current topography. However, it should be noted that the Palawan region has been tectonically stable for a longer period than is typical for the region (see below) and shows evidence of a potentially unusual and interesting set of circumstances. Because the channel between Borneo and Palawan is 145 m deep, a landbridge may have existed between Borneo and Palawan during the late middle Pleistocene (about 160000 years ago), but not more recently. Thus, the Palawan region fauna seen today occurred on a single large island during the late Pleistocene (Fig. l ) , and has been isolated from its source in Borneo since the middle Pleistocene, The shallow (140 m) San Bernardino Channel between southern Luzon and northern Samar might also have been dry during the late middle Pleistocene, allowing free exchange through much of the archipelago.",

The continental rocks are Palaeozoic and Mesozoic in age and consist of some clastic sediments and limestone. Limestone sediments containing fossils of marine invertebrates on top of the continental rocks indicate that shallow marine conditions existed from the Jurassic to the Eocene. Recent data suggest a mid-Oligocene to early Miocene (32 to 17 Ma BP) rifting of this material away from the Asian continent (Taylor & Hayes, 1980; Holloway, 1982) ; no evidence yet suggests subaerial (emergent) islands before the Miocene.

However, there is also a less apparent but important affinity to the south. According to Musser & Califia (1982), the endemic Rattus mindorensis is most closely related to Ruttus tiomanicus, which is absent from Luzon but occurs on Palawan and Calawit (near Busuanga), and the endemic genus Anonomomys is most closely related to Haeromys, which occurs on Palawan and Busuanga but not Luzon (Musser & Newcomb, 1983: 559) .

The fauna of Greater Palawan is quite similar to Borneo at the generic level and has little in common with Luzon. This similarity with Borneo is indicative of a middle Pleistocene landbridge connection. Mindoro has elements of both the Luzon and Palawan faunas and thus appears to have received immigrants from both directions.

The large islands in the Luzon and Mindanao groups have smaller faunas than would islands of the same size on the Sunda Shelf, and also have fewer species than islands of their size in the Palawan group (28 species rather than 41 for Luzon, and 25 rather than 40 for Mindanao). However, small islands in the Mindanao region (e.g. Dinagat and Maripipi) have about the number of species expected for the Palawan group, but fewer than expected for the Sunda Shelf islands. Islands that comprised Greater Luzon and Mindanao appear to lie on a single regression line which is shallower in slope than the Palawan group line (0.167 versus 0.246). Inspection of Fig. 4 suggests that the difference in slope primarily reflects the depauperate faunas of Luzon and Mindanao, relative to the Palawan group. The three isolated oceanic islands (Mindoro, Negros and Camiguin) lie below the other regression lines; the correlation coefficient for these islands (0.922) is high but not significant. Nevertheless, it is clear that isolated oceanic islands are the most impoverished in the Philippines. It is interesting to note that the relative degree of impoverishment (increasing from Mindoro to Negros to Camiguin) parallels the approximate geological age of these islands (Mio-Pliocene, Plio-Pleistocene, and Pleistocene-Recent, respectively). This correlation implies that colonization of these islands has been very slow. A substantial portion of Mindoro's fauna is endemic (43% of the 14 species), a lesser portion of the smaller fauna of Negros is endemic ( 12.5% of eight species) and neither of the two species indigenous to Camiguin is endemic. The trend in endemism correlates with the apparent age and the impoverishment of these islands. Thus, the size of mammalian faunas on isolated oceanic islands in the Philippines is correlated with the geological age of the islands. The older, less impoverished faunas contain proportionately and absolutely more endemic species than the newer, more impoverished faunas. The correlation between number of endemic species and area is discussed in the next section.",

The large number of endemic species and genera suggests that at least some species originated as a result of speciation by colonizers, so that the number of colonizers need not have been great.

As discussed above, the degree of impoverishment of these islands is inversely correlated with geological age of a given island. This implies that colonization is very slow, with species accumulating over long periods of time. Mindoro, with 14 native species, has existed since Mio-Pliocene times, c. 8-10 Ma BP; Negros, with eight species, originated during Plio-Pleistocene times, c. 1-4 Ma BP; and Camiguin, with two native species, originated as a single volcano during the Pleistocene, less than 1 Ma BP. Minimum estimates for the ages of the islands as moderately large areas are not available, but are unlikely to be less than one-fourth of maximum age. Thus, successful colonization can be estimated as being on the order of magnitude of once per quarter-million to half-million years.

Musser (1977a) listed six species of commensal murid rodents, all of which he believed were introduced to the Philippines. To these may be added an insectivore, the house shrew (Suncus murinus), which has been transported into the Pacific as far as Guam (Heaney, unpubl. obs.) . All of the species but one (Rattus nitidus) are widespread in SE Asia and much of Australasia, most occur in all faunal regions of the Philippines (Musser, 1977a) and most show no conspicuous variation within the Philippines (an exception is Rattus exulans). Darlington (1957: 504) pointed out that the few non-endemic, noncommensal species on Luzon are among the very few non-volant species that occur on both sides of Wallace's Line further south. All of these species are economically important as food sources by humans: pigs, monkeys and civet cats. O n this basis, Darlington suggested that they were introduced to Luzon. Groves ( 1983) has summarized evidence that pigs (Sus) were often transported from island to island in Australasia, with introductions dating as early as 4000 BP. He also showed evidence that Macaca, Paradoxurus and Vicerra were transported widely (Groves, 1984) . If these species have been introduced into the Philippines, then only three ungulates and one carnivore are indigenous to all of the Philippines, except for species on the Palawan chain. The one certainly indigenous ungulate, the endemic dwarf water buffalo, is confined to Mindoro; the other two indigenous species are deer of the genus Cervus (Grubb & Groves, 1983) . The native carnivore, the tiger cat (Felis bengalensis), occurs only on Palawan, which was connected to Borneo, and on Cebu, Negros and Panay, which made up a single isolated island during the late Pleistocene.",

If Macaca, Paradoxurus, Viverra and Sus are removed from the faunal similarity analyses discussed earlier, the result is to increase the distinctiveness of each of the Philippine faunal regions and to decrease their already low level of similarity to the Sunda Shelf islands. It also distinguishes the Philippine islands (excluding those of the Palawan chain) from islands on the Sunda Shelf in faunal composition (Fig. 6 ) by increasing the relative proportions of rodents and insectivores and greatly decreasing the proportion of carnivores, primates and ungulates.

Moore ( 1959) suggested a complicated pattern of biogeographic distribution and relationship involving the pygmy squirrels and two genera of tree squirrels on the Sunda Shelf, Philippines and Celebes. A more comprehensive analysis demonstrated a simpler situation, in which pygmy squirrels originated on the Sunda Shelf and a single species dispersed into the Philippines from Borneo (Heaney, 1985a) . As has often been noted, the family Muridae is represented in the Philippines by a large and diverse assemblage of species. Current studies (Musser, Heaney & Rabor, 1985; Musser & Heaney, unpubl. obs.) indicate that the 40 known species, representing 15 genera, are members of seven different clades that represent a maximum of seven and a minimum of five colonization events. Each clade is derived from a group of murids that is most diverse on the Sunda Shelf and appears to have originated in that region. It is not clear from the available data whether these clades entered the Philippines via the Palawan route or the Sulu route, but there is no evidence for their arrival from Celebes, New Guinea or Taiwan.",

Sixteen of the 28 species native to Luzon, or 57%, are members of the largest clade, showing the tremendous importance of indigenous speciation.

Non-volant mammals have entered the archipelago predominantly from Borneo, which is the nearest continental shelf land mass, by dispersal over narrow salt-water barriers. These barriers continue to be the major factors defining the distributions of species. Extinction on the Palawan chain was probably very high following its initial isolation from Borneo, but after about 160 000 years it retains a large and diverse fauna in which extinction is low and speciation does occur.

O n the other hand, narrow sea-water channels between islands have served as major, nearly insurmountable barriers to many non-volant mammals. Large but geologically young islands separated from rich faunal sources by 5-20 km of sea water have extremely depauperate faunas.

It is apparent that speciation within archipelagos is a major generative factor among SE Asian mammals; on Luzon, for example, speciation has exceeded colonization by a factor of about two to one, However, the matter of an interaction between speciation and colonization has not been addressed.

Development of such a model requires an increased emphasis on obtaining data on long-term patterns of the three crucial variables and makes apparent the need for accurate, detailed analysis of phylogenetic relationships of species. Without these data, it will be impossible to measure or model actual rates of colonization or speciation. Such a model lies well outside the realm of the traditional equilibrium model, or more precisely, the equilibrium model would be a special case of this more general (hypothetical) model. Vicariance biogeography (e.g. Nelson & Platnick, 1981) provides the framework for quantification of speciation, and integration of the two models could be richly rewarding.",

More oceanic islands must be surveyed to provide quantitative estimates of the influence of island size, geological age and distance on colonization rates. Wallacea appears to be the ideal place to conduct such research because of the unique configuration of islands. It is also essential that repeated surveys be done to provide data on turnover rates, which Morgan & Woods (1986) and I have had to disregard due to lack of data. The sole set of turnover data currently available for vertebrates on isolated islands comes from Krakatau Island, but these data do not include repeated thorough surveys of mammals (Simkin & Fiske, 1983) . The frequency of adaptive radiation in isolated archipelagos is axiomatic in Darwinian evolution (e.g. Carlquist, 1974; Patton, 1984) , but it is rarely directly included in studies that utilize the equilibrium model (but see MacArthur & Wilson, 1967: 173) . We need more phylogentic analyses to allow measurement of indigenous speciation rates in order to determine the effects of body size, trophic level and other variables on speciation rate. Data in this paper lead me to predict that speciation rate will be related to colonization rate in a complex fashion, with speciation rate initially increasing as colonization rate increases to some low level (providing the raw material for speciation), and decreasing thereafter as colonization rate increases. I know of no data that could be used to test this prediction, but its testing is fundamental to development of the trivariate equilibrium model discussed earlier.",

In the data presented above, I found evidence that the important processes in mammalian island biogeography often take place over thousands or millions of years. If these time spans are typically necessary for equilibrium to be achieved, then equilibrium will be rare, because major geological and climatic processes occur on the same time scale. Island arcs, for example, are intrinsically unstable, resulting from dynamic, ongoing tectonic processes, and habitat islands change in size and position as climate changes on a global scale. The appropriate model, then, becomes one of dynamic disequilibrium, in which geological and climatic processes are always a step ahead of the biotic systems, and faunas, in effect, chase their changing equilibrium point through time, always a step or two out of phase.",

For each group, the number of native species (and percentage of the fauna in parentheses) is given for each island from the Sunda Shelf pattern in having proportionately larger carnivore and ungulate faunas. Negros and Camiguin are atypical in nearly all respects; it should be recalled that these islands have markedly depauperate faunas.I conclude that islands in the Philippines lack the consistency and predictability of community composition shown by the Sunda Shelf islands. Islands in the Palawan chain are most like those on the Sunda Shelf, differing most conspicuously in having more carnivores. Small islands in the Mindanao chain sometimes have faunas similar to those on Sunda Shelf islands (Dinagat), and sometimes not (Maripipi) . Mindanao is moderately dissimilar, as is Mindoro. Luzon is strongly dissimilar, as are the isolated oceanic islands of Negros and Camiguin.",
