This could be effected by altering the size of the medulla or changing the number of cell spaces contained in it.

All species, except A. lagopus, increase the amount of air trapped within the upper shaft of the white hairs. In all but L. Arcticus, this was accomplished by increased width of the medulla and greater number of cells that comprise the medulla. The increase in the amount of air trapped in the winter guard hairs could result in hairs that are better insulators. Mustela nivalis also increased the width of the medulla and Comparison of Winter Fur and Summer Fur 281 number of air cells within the lower shaft of the white winter hairs. The width of the upper shaft of white hairs was increased in both Leporids, which should allow for more trapped air within the hair coat. Further, the increased width makes a more spatulate upper shaft, especially when combined with the much reduced lower shaft of winter hairs. For summer hairs of L. Arcticus, the lower shaft width is 30% that of the upper shaft width, but reduces to only 16.6% of the upper shaft width in winter. A similar shaft shape change occurs in L. americanus, with 36.5% in summer and only 18.1% in winter. This appreciable structural reorganization may allow hairs to function against wind or snow in a manner similar to the way otter hairs respond to aquatic environments. Otter guard hairs have a broad spatulate upper shaft and a narrow base. When an otter enters the water, only the upper shaft bends and the distal portion of the fur is matted down, trapping air next to the skin. This keeps the animal dry and provides significant insulation in the form of a warmed air layer (Ling 1970) . A similar phenomenon based on relative size of the upper and lower shaft occurs in fossorial animals. By forming a barrier against soiling and wetting, the underfur remains undisturbed and the insulative properties of the fur are not compromised (Stangl et al. 1986) .",

Reynolds (1993) observed increased fur density in the winter pelage of the collared lemming (Dicrostonyx groenlandicus), another mammal that molts into a white pelage in the winter. Stangl et al. (1986) noted the increase in wool underfur hairs by the initiation of previously dormant hair follicles. Another consequence of decreased lower shaft size is more room for greater amounts of air trapped between the skin and the fur. This air layer is correlated to fur thickness (the distance from the skin to the outside of the fur) and contributes to increased insulation (Chappell 1980a; Hammel 1955; Davis & Birkebak 1975) . Spotila & Gates (1975) noted that a change in fur thickness (and consequently air layer size) that occurs at a small energetic cost has the same effect on reducing heat loss as a large change in body size that occurs at a much higher energetic cost. Structural changes in guard hairs for winter likely accommodate these adaptive changes for thermoregulation.",

Winter plumage is white in an Arctic bird, the Rock Ptarmigan (Lagopus mums). Although the barbules of summer feathers are solid, the white winter feathers have air-filled barbules. Dyck (1979) found that the air spaces increase light reflection and add to the whiteness, aiding in camouflage in snow-covered habitats. The linear cell count near the base of guard hairs did not vary significantly in most species of mammals examined, yet upper shaft cell counts (and width of the upper medulla) tended to increase (Table 1 ). Because the upper shaft is more exposed to the environment, these observations are consistent with the hypothesis that increased numbers of air spaces could serve to whiten the winter fur for camouflage.",
