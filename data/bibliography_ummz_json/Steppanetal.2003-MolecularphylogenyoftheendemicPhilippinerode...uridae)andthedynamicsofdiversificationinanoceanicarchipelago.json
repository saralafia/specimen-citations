    "abstract": "We analysed the phylogenetic relationships of ten of the 13 known species of the genus Apomys using DNA sequences from cytochrome b. Apomys, endemic to oceanic portions of the Philippine archipelago, diversified during the Pliocene as these oceanic islands arose de novo. Several of the speciation events probably took place on Luzon or Mindanao, the two largest, oldest, and most topographically complex islands. Only one speciation event is associated with vicariance due to Pleistocene sea-level fluctuation, and a Pleistocene diversification model in which isolation is driven by sea-level changes is inconsistent with the data. Tectonic vicariance is nearly absent from the Philippines, in which tectonic coalescence plays a significant role. Most speciation events (about two-thirds) are associated with dispersal to newly developed oceanic islands. The data imply that the species have persisted for long periods, measured in millions of years after their origins; further implications therefore are that faunal turnover is very slow, and persistence over geological time spans is more prominent than repeated colonization and extinction. Neither the equilibrium nor the vicariance model of biogeography adequately encompasses these results; a model incorporating colonization, extinction, and speciation is necessary and must incorporate long-term persistence to accommodate our observations.",

Nevertheless, the number of case studies in which the history and processes of diversification is well documented is small, even among vertebrates (e.g. Otte & Endler, 1989; Ricklefs & Schluter, 1993; Grant, 1998; Magurran & May, 1999) . Further, such studies have not usually figured in analysis of the dynamics of species-richness patterns under either of the current dominant models, the equilibrium model of island biogeography and vicariance biogeography (Whittaker, 1998; Heaney, 2000; Lomolino, 2000) . Much recent progress on some issues involving diversification has been made under the rubric of phylogeography (e.g. Riddle, 1995 Riddle, , 1996 Avise, 2000; Arbogast & Kenagy, 2001) , but most such studies deal with single species, not extensive radiations, and we know of only two that have been placed in the context of long-term dynamics of patterns of insular species richness (Moritz et al., 2000; Ricklefs & Bermingham, 2001 ). Here we test hypotheses of speciation and explore patterns of diversification in the Philippine islands using a molecular phylogeny of an endemic rodent clade.",

                "text": "The Philippine Islands, comprising c. 7000 islands ranging up to 100 000 km 2 , represent a natural theatre in which to investigate such issues. With the exception of one small set (the Palawan group), all of the islands are oceanic in origin, having emerged because of a complex but now well-documented set of tectonic events (Hall, 1996 (Hall, , 1998 (Hall, , 2002 . Periods of lowered sea level during the many Pleistocene 'ice ages' caused some sets of current islands to coalesce into larger ones ( Fig. 1 ), but many remained separate across channels ranging from 1 to 25 km, and each of those oceanic islands that existed during Pleistocene periods of low sea level is a highly distinctive biogeographical region with 50-85% endemism among the non-flying mammals (Heaney, 1986 (Heaney, , 1991 Heaney & Regaldo, 1998) . Overall, the mammalian fauna of the Philippine Islands is unusually rich in endemic species, including 85 out of 99 native non-flying mammals. Moreover, many genera are endemic, and many of them seem to form larger clades that are themselves endemic to the archipelago (Heaney & Rickart, 1990; Musser & Heaney, 1992) , so a great deal of diversification must have taken place within the archipelago (Heaney, 1986 (Heaney, , 2000 , leading to a description of the Philippines as 'the Galapagos times 10' (Heaney & Regaldo, 1998) . Thus, the archipelago and its biota represent a good model system for investigating the role of diversification in dynamics of species richness.",

Prominent among various hypotheses has been the proposal that, as biomes shift elevationally with glacial cycles, species ranges expand and contract, resulting in coalesence and fragmentation of populations. If the fragmentation leads to speciation, this Pleistocene speciation hypothesis provides a general vicariant explanation for biogeographical patterns among many taxonomic groups. In areas of high relief, such as on islands or in mountainous regions, this process has been called a 'species pump' because it is expected to accelerate the rate of speciation relative to those of less topographically diverse regions. The same process can also occur on a continental scale (Zink et al., 2000) . Recent tests of the Pleistocene speciation hypothesis have generally failed to support it, finding instead that most sister species diverged from each other prior to the most intense glaciations or prior to the Pleistocene entirely (e.g. Zink et al., 2000; Johnson, 2002) . As described in more detail below, the geological history of the Philippine Islands makes them one of the most amenable regions of the world to testing this hypothesis. The islands have undergone a wellunderstood sequence of coalescence and fragmentation because of sea-level changes. The Pleistocene speciation hypothesis predicts that sister species or sister clades will occupy adjacent islands that were previously joined together as larger oceanic 'Pleistocene islands' and that these divergences will date to the glacial period. Because the Philippine Islands are so conducive to this process, if the Pleistocene speciation process operated commonly, its effects should be detectable in the Philippines. Failure to find support for the Pleistocene speciation hypothesis in the Philippines would therefore be compelling evidence against its generality.",

Briefly, the current archipelago consists of three distinct geological units of very different origins that have approached one another and are now coalescing: the north-western (e.g. Mindoro), north-eastern (e.g. Luzon), and southeastern (e.g. Mindanao) blocks. The first of these includes the modern islands of Palawan and Mindoro and small pieces of several other extant islands. These originated as portions of Asian continental shelf that begin to rift away from the region south of modern Taiwan during the mid-Oligocene, 30-35 Myr ago (Mya). All portions of this continental material were below sea level at the time and remained below sea level until they were uplifted and emerged as de novo oceanic islands capped with marine sediments beginning about 10 Mya, in the late Miocene. This emergence took place initially in the area of modern Mindoro, which remained isolated from other islands subsequently. Palawan emerged later, beginning in the early Pliocene, c. 5 Mya, and eventually reached sufficient size and height that it was connected to northern Borneo (but not the rest of the Philippine islands) during the penultimate glacial event, c. 165 000 years ago, and perhaps during some prior glacial events. Palawan currently has a mammalian fauna largely derived from that of the continental Sunda Shelf (Heaney, 1986; Brown & Guttman, 2002) . The second primary geological unit, known today as central and northern Luzon, emerged as several small dry-land islands during the mid-Oligocene, roughly 30-35 Mya, hundreds of kilometres south-east of where it lies currently. It developed from volcanoes that lay between a spreading zone and a subduction zone, producing a series of small, very isolated islands that rose then eroded as the rock units gradually moved north-west. The first development of a large island took place in the middle Miocene, about 15 Mya, as proto-Luzon approached proto-Mindoro; a large island (at least 25 000 km 2 ) in present-day northern Luzon has persisted since that time, characterized by frequent volcanic activity associated with several subduction zones. Luzon enlarged substantially during the Pliocene (which extended from 5 to 1.8 Mya), as it and proto-Mindanao came into proximity.",

Additional uplift began about 6-8 Mya in the late Miocene as proto-Mindanao and proto-Luzon came into closer proximity and began to coalesce. Much of the uplift of the smaller current islands and some peninsulas has taken place during the Pliocene subsequent to 5 Mya; the uplift of the southern (Bicol) peninsula of Luzon began about 3.5 Mya (Heaney et al., 1999) , Greater Negros-Panay about the same time, and such smaller islands as Sibuyan and Camiguin not more than 2 Mya.

Each species was represented by at least two specimens, and four were represented by three or more. Outgroup taxa were Batomys granti (Thomas, 1895), Chrotomys gonzalesi (Rickart & Heaney, 1991) , Archboldomys luzonensis (Musser, 1982) , and Rhynchomys isarogensis (Musser & Freeman, 1981) , all of which are Philippine endemic genera. Batomys was designated the outgroup for rooting on the basis of a broader sampling of murine and muroid taxa for four nuclear exons (S. J. Steppan, R. M. Adkins & J. Anderson, unpubl. data). Locality and voucher information is listed in the Appendix. Sequences have been submitted to GenBank under accession numbers AY324458-AY324489.",

A sequential optimization approach (Swofford et al., 1996; Fratti et al., 1997) was used to estimate the cyt b phylogeny. Initial trees were generated by MP. All MP analyses used heuristic searches with tree bisection-reconnection (TBR) branch swapping and 30 random-addition replicates. The ML parameter values were estimated under a nested array of substitution models for the MP tree (Swofford et al., 1996; Fratti et al., 1997) as implemented in Modeltest 3.04 (Posada & Crandall, 1998) . Each of these models was evaluated for among-site rate variation under equal rates, a portion of the sites assumed to be invariable (I), rates among all sites assumed to vary according to a gamma distribution (\u0393: Yang, 1994) , and a combination of invariable sites and gamma-distributed rates. Because each of the models can be considered a special case of the most general, GTR + I + \u0393, a likelihood-ratio test can be used to test for significant differences in the contributions of each model parameter to explaining the data (Yang, Goldman & Friday, 1995) . The TrN + \u0393 model (two transition types, one transversion type (Tamura & Nei, 1993) , with gamma-distributed among-site rate variation) was a significantly better fit for cyt b than simpler models without introducing extraneous parameters. We then conducted a ML search using the preferred model with parameters fixed at the values estimated on the MP tree. Heuristic searches were conducted with 20 random-addition replicates and TBR branch swapping. Model parameters were reestimated from the initial ML tree, and the process repeated until the topology of the reestimated tree matched that of the tree from the previous search, never requiring more than one iteration.",

Several alternative constraints that allowed some minimal dispersal or within-modern-island speciation were tried (e.g. not all species on Luzon grouped into a single clade), effectively relaxing some assumptions. Equally weighted MP searches were conducted with constraints enforced to match predicted topologies for each hypothesis. Differences in tree lengths between constrained searches and the most parsimonious tree were tested with the Kishino\u2212 Hasegawa (Kishino & Hasegawa, 1989 ), Templeton (Templeton, 1987) , and Shimodaira\u2212Hasegawa (Shimodaira & Hasegawa, 1999) tests.

Because no Apomys fossils are available for internal rate calibrations, we used an external calibration of the divergence of Mus from Rattus at 9.5 Mya, based on a recalibrated nuclear gene molecular clock (S. J. Steppan, R. M. Adkins & J. Anderson, unpubl. data) using 12 Myr as the origin of modern murines (Jacobs & Downs, 1994) . Cyt b sequences for Mus and Rattus were obtained from GenBank (accession nos J01420 and NC001665). In a likelihood-ratio test of a molecular clock, likelihoods are estimated with and without enforcement of a clock. Likelihood ratios are chi-squared distributed, so twice the difference in log likelihoods is compared to the critical value from a chi-squared table, and the degrees of freedom are equal to the number of OTUs\u22122 (number of branches\u22121; Huelsenbeck & Rannala, 1997). A molecular clock was rejected for the complete data set (P = 0.04), and initial phylogenetic analyses showed Archboldomys to be an outlier with an unusually short branch leading to it. After the slowly evolving Archboldomys was excluded, a likelihood ratio test showed that the Apomys data did not deviate significantly from a molecular-clock model (2 L = 39.4, d.f. = 29, P = 0.06), so genetic distances were estimated under the clock model and the same TrN + \u0393 model used for phylogeny estimation. Apomys datae (slow) and A. gracilirostris (fast) also deviated somewhat from a clock-like pattern, but their exclusion had little impact on the likelihood of a molecular clock, either in addition to the exclusion of Archboldomys or by themselves. Given that deviation from the molecular clock was only marginally non-significant, we report the estimated dates with caution. We also calculated the number of third-position transversion differences, which have been recommended for mitochondrial genes because they tend to evolve in a more clock-like fashion than other transformations without the excessive homoplasy of third-position transitions, which can skew genetic distance estimates (Smith & Patton, 1999; Conroy & Cook, 2000) . Third-position transversions produced a rate estimate of 1.23% per Myr. The dates estimated by the two methods were similar, and we report the ML distances here because the transversion distances exhibited at least as much lineage-rate variation, and very recent divergences were less reliable (because of stochastic variation caused by many fewer data).",

Because we are interested in dating the possible events associated with speciation and not the coalescence times of gene lineages, we adjusted the divergence dates described above by subtracting the mean divergence dates within modern species (Avise & Walker, 1998; Edwards & Beerli, 2000) . The modern values were used as representative of the average divergences within the ancestral species at the time of speciation. We focused on the diversity that accumulates within populations and geographical regions but did not include within-species comparisons from different regions because deep phylogeographical divergences may be caused by the geohistorical events we are testing for. Therefore, we included only those species that showed significant variation (datae, gracilirostris, microdon) in the calculation of average within-species divergences. Divergences between northern and southern Luzon populations of A. microdon were not included, but divergences within these regions were included. The effect of this correction is to reduce the estimated divergence dates and thus to yield a conservative estimate with respect to the Pleistocene speciation hypothesis.",

Some form of autochthonous speciation on Mindanao island is likely. Other cases are more ambiguous. Cladogenesis leading to A. microdon and the ancestor of the clade including A. musculus and A. sp.

Inclusion of A. sacobianus and A. abrae in a clade with A. microdon\u2212musculus would imply speciation on Luzon because all are restricted to northern Luzon. We have noted the likely impact of habitat vicariance for species of rodents in other genera that occur on Luzon (Rickart et al., 1998 ), but we have noted no clear cases within Apomys. Overall, we conclude that 3-4 out of the 11 speciation events sampled here probably occurred on the two largest and oldest oceanic islands (Luzon and Mindanao), but that this is not the dominant mode of diversification in Apomys.",

These constrained searches yielded trees that were all significantly worse than the optimal trees by Templeton or Shimodaira\u2212Hasegawa tests, supporting rejection of the hypothesis (e.g. ML, Fig. 2 ; P < 0.001). This hypothesis might be overly restrictive in not allowing independent lineages to undergo vicariant speciation on the Pleistocene islands. Relaxing that constraint results in many possible combinations of hypotheses because the Pleistocene vicariance-speciation hypothesis does not specify the taxonomic rank for the vicariant events. Less restrictive constraints, for example excluding the older A. datae\u2212gracilostris lineage from the constrained Greater Luzon clade, also produced trees significantly worse than the optimal ones. We then focused on non-statistical tests of the hypothesis that sister species or sister clades occupy islands that were previously joined into the large Pleistocene islands. Of the ten nodes within Apomys above the species level, only one conforms to that prediction; A. sp. D from Billiran and Leyte and the A. hylocoetes\u2212insignis clade from Mindanao are sister clades. We conclude that support for this hypothesis is very weak.",

Adkins & J. Anderson, unpubl. data) for calibration, are plotted in Figure 3 . Because these distances are corrected to reflect divergence times of species rather than divergence times of gene lineages within species, the within-species values tend to be negative. Apomys gracilirostris is the only species in our sample that exhibits deep within-species divergences, to nearly 400 000 years, but we have limited geographical sampling for several of the other species, and additional sampling may well uncover more genetic diversity. Most species-level divergences predate the Pleistocene entirely, and the youngest of those, between the A. sp. D clade from Billiran and Leyte and the A. hylocoetes\u2212 insignis clade from Mindanao, dates to approximately 1.05 Mya in the Early Pleistocene. This is also the only speciation event that is topologically consistent with the Pleistocene sea-level vicariance hypothesis. Figure 4 shows the ML estimate of the phylogeny under a molecular clock scaled to the calibrated time scale. Notable divergence dates include the split of A. sp. D on the oceanic island Camiguin from its Greater Mindanao sister clade approximately 1.7-2.2 Mya and basal divergences within the northerncentral clade clustering between 1.4 and 2.1 Mya. The basal divergences within the genus date back to 3-4.2 Mya.

J. Steppan, R. M. Adkins, & J. Anderson, unpubl. data.) . Luzon was then a large island, Mindanao was beginning a period of uplift and coalescence of many fragments, and Mindoro was present, but few other substantial islands in the Philippines were above water; most of the development of the archipelago as a set of dryland islands took place during the last 5 Myr (Pliocene and Pleistocene), and uplifting continues today. The constraints on the time of origin of Apomys (c. 4-5 Mya) and the origin of the majority of the Philippine islands indicates that speciation could not have occurred in the earliest uplift phase of 10 Mya but rather might have begun at the earliest during the more extensive uplift phase of 2-5 Mya (Pliocene or very early Pleistocene). This 'Pliocene diversification hypothesis' therefore predicts diversification times of mostly 2-5 Mya, during the Pliocene epoch. Further, this model might be expected to produce speciation dates that are correlated with the ages of the islands on which the mice live, whereas a high-turnover model with dispersal based on the 'late Pleistocene diversification hypothesis' is unlikely to produce a statistical association between island age and age of origin of a given species. We thus have two sets of predictions, one that anticipates ages for Apomys species of less than 1 Myr and another that anticipates ages of 2-5 Myr on most islands and perhaps more on Luzon, where we postulate the genus originated. We estimated time of divergence of the various clades of Apomys from cyt b data under a molecular clock. Although the data within Apomys are statistically consistent with a molecular clock, some lineagespecific rate variation results in approximately \u00b1 10% range in dates. Allowing for additional error due to inaccuracies in the rate calibrations (e.g. phylogenetic placement of the calibration fossil and possibly unrecognized rate variation among Mus, Rattus, and Apomys), we suggest that these should be viewed as estimating the true dates \u00b1 30% and perhaps more for the most recent divergences. Such errors would not, however, appreciably change the following discussion.",

Although these dates must be viewed as no more than rough estimates, it is clear that, in addition to the Pleistocene sea-level vicariance hypothesis discussed earlier, the 'late Pleistocene divergence hypothesis' can also be rejected; no evidence supports any speciation events during the last 1 Myr except for the speciation of A. hylocoetes and A. insignis on Mindanao, which involved major chromosomal rearrangements, as described above.

We estimate the origin of the genus at 4-6 Mya, near the onset of much of the Pliocene geological uplift of the archipelago. The most basal divergence within the genus, between the A. datae\u2212 gracilirostris clade and all other extant taxa, is estimated at about 3.6-4.2 Mya, well after the beginnings of the Pliocene uplift. Diversification apparently took place rapidly thereafter; the A. datae-A. gracilirostris divergence (which involved dispersal from Luzon to Mindoro) is dated at about 2.8-3.2 Mya, and the others followed quickly. The split between the large northern A. microdon clade and the large southern A. hylocoetes clade about 2.4-3 Mya followed the development of extensive dry-land islands between the northern core of Luzon and the central core of Mindanao by about 1 Myr. Divergence between A. microdon and the ancestor of the A. musculus clade 1.9-2.2 Mya apparently took place on Luzon during the time when the island was enlarging through the uplift of its southern and central areas (Heaney, 2000) . The apparent dispersal of members of the A. musculus clade to Greater Negros/Panay and Sibuyan about 1.7 Mya followed the uplift of southern Luzon and was roughly concurrent with the uplift of Sibuyan. Dispersal to Camiguin and divergence by the ancestor of A. sp. D c. 1.8-2.1 Mya is consistent with rough estimates of the age of Camiguin of 1-2 Mya. Divergence between the ancestor of A. hylocoetes-insignis and A. sp. F (from Leyte and adjacent islands) about 1 Mya may have involved sea-level vicariance; by that time, Greater Mindanao would have existed as a single dryland mass during periods of low sea level and as several smaller islands during high sea level (as is the case today).",

A non-parametric test of association between the 'clock dates' and the estimated dates of origin of the islands is significant (P < 0.05; Fig. 6 ). In other words, the mice dispersed from Luzon, the oldest and largest island, to the various other islands fairly soon after they became dry land. This result also implies that they have persisted since then with very low rates of extinction. Clearly, if a species is endemic to a single island and originated >2 Mya, it cannot have undergone repeated extinction and recolonization; rather, it is far more likely to have persisted on the one island since its origin.",

The data presented here strongly imply that turnover has not been rapid; rather, colonization was initially rapid but was followed by persistence on a geological time scale. The result, apparently, is a system in which colonization of de novo oceanic islands has sometimes happened soon after their uplift and has resulted in speciation and attendant diversification within the lineage as a whole. Although some diversification may have taken place on single islands, this has apparently been the case only on Luzon and Mindanao, the two largest, oldest, and most topographically diverse islands (Rickart et al., 1998) . Thus, diversification in this most speciose of Philippine murid rodents has largely been a process of colonization across sea channels to newly formed oceanic islands, followed by genetic differentiation and longterm persistence. Moritz et al. (2000) summarized evidence of similar, pre-Pleistocene origins for many extant species of continental rainforest mammals and emphasized the role of persistence, rather than turnover, in those faunas. Although our data are not consistent with recent usage of the MacArthur and Wilson equilibrium model, neither are they consistent with the vicariance model of biogeography, because it is apparent that dispersal rather than vicariance (whether by tectonic processes, sea level change, or vegetational change) has primarily driven diversification in this speciose genus. Rather than either the bivariate equilibrium or vicariance models, we believe that tripartite models that fully incorporate the processes of diversification, colonization, and extinction hold much more promise for general modelling of the dynamics of species richness in situations such as this (Heaney, 2000; Lomolino, 2000) . Specifically, the data presented here provide support for the graphical model presented by Heaney (2000) , in which phylogenesis is predicted to be ongoing and cumulative (with little extinction), gradually raising species-richness levels on isolated archipelagos to levels similar to those seen on land-bridge islands that have undergone postisolation relaxation (i.e. where a reduction in area has produced a decline in faunal richness, with rates of extinction and colonization more or less in equilibrium).",

                "text": "Sequence data for ten of the c. 13 species of the Philippine endemic genus Apomys allow the construction of a robust phylogeny for the genus and estimation of the geographical history within the archipelago, which has a complex but fairly clearly documented history as a set of oceanic islands that have undergone gradual decrease in isolation (through plate movement), increase in area (through uplift and associated volcanic activity), and coalescence (through tectonic movement). We therefore reject both vicariance (induced by tectonic or Pleistocene sea-level change) and the MacArthur\u2212Wilson equilibrium model (and its implied high turnover of species) as general explanations for diversification in Apomys. Instead, our data document Pliocene diversification in which most divergence occurred after long-distance dispersal among oceanic islands; we favour a conceptual model that explicitly includes colonization, phylogenesis, and extinction. Such knowledge of the place of origin and age of diversification of species allows testing of what have previously often been untestable assumptions about rates of primary biogeographical processes (diversification, colonization, and extinction) in island archipelagos and permit accurate and predictive modelling.",
