Cockrum (MAMMALS OF KANSAS, 1952: 248) lists its distribution 88, \"probably the southwestern part of the state, known only from one specimen from Seward County.\" I first encountered this animal about one mile west of Feterita, Stevens County, Section 30, Township 338, and Range 39W, on June 4.1952 when I salvaged a specimen from highway 46 and 51. It had apparently been run over by a dual wheeled truck, 88 the skull and hindquarters were badly crushed. On November 10, 1953, during the pheasant season, I received a telephone call from Preston Osborne of Lakin, Kansas, saying a hunter friend of his, Mr. Dorsch of Kansas City, had shot what he thought to be a rabbit in the weeds, but found he had shot into a fs.mily of what they thought were young mink, MwJtela vi80n letifera (Hollister). I drove to Lakin and found these animals to be New-Mexican bridled weasels. According to Mr. Osborn, there were two adults and four young in the family. Two of the young had been killed and another wounded, which died three days later. The location of the family had been along the southeast shore of Lake McKinney, Section 7, Township 24S, Range 35W. Two of the specimens were made into life mounts, one returned to Mr. Osborne, the other retained by me. The third was given to Dr. Claude W. Hibbard of the University of Mich",

In the fall of 1944, while I was on duty with the USAAF at San Angelo, Texas, my wife and I were presented with a young female Bassari8CU8 astutus. It had been captured for me by So game warden somewhere southwest of San Angelo. He informed me that he obtained it from a nest in a rock wall, and that they were easy to locate in such places since the young ringtails could be heard voicing annoyance when one passed by.",

It enjoyed running about on the sun porch and climbing on the SCreens when allowed the freedom of the house. It made no serious efforts that we could see to get outside. Picking it up was somewhat of a problem as our pet did not like to be handled and would struggle and squirm vigorously to be free. Fortunately it never made any serious attempt to bite. It was most convenient to pick it up by the tail, an action to which it did not usually object. If it did resent being so handled, instead of struggling, a strong odor reminiscent of weasel was emitted.",

It was allowed considerably more freedom here, and eventually got outside during severe weather in January, 1947 . No trace could be found of our pet for several weeks thereafter. The house in Ha.milton had six very large and old Norwa.y spruce a.bout it. These trees, and those of the neighborhood generally, supported a large population of red squirrels. Several times in the weeks following the escape, I found red squirrel remains under these spruce trees, usually the remains consisted of entire tails, feet, and pieces of skin and fur. Returning home late one night during a snow storm, my wife and I were amazed to see our Bassariscus revealed by the car hea.dlights on a low limb of one of the spruces, with a small mammal in its mouth. It quickly disappeared up the tree. At the base of the tree was the tail of a red squirrel. There were no tracks in the snow nor did we ever find any tracks of Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jmammal/article/36/2/292/960755 by University of Michigan user on 07 October 2021",
