Karyotypes were prepared from 146 individuals, representing nine populations evenly spaced along a 2,000-km north-south transect in Paraguay and Argentina, to determine the nature, extent, and pattern of chromosomal variation in Holochilus brasiliensis chacarius and H. vulpinus. Two distinct patterns of chromosomal variation characterized these two spe cies. In H. brasiliensis, the diploid number (2n) ranged from 48 to 56 and the nombre fondamental (NF) from 57 to 63. Four classes of chromosomal variation were found in populations of //. brasiliensis: whole-arm Robertsonian (Rb) translocations, including Rb changes with monobrachial homology, variation in the number and kind of supernumerary (B) chromosomes, centromeric rearrangements (putative pericentric inversions), and variation in the amount of euchromatin. The amount of structural variation was uniformly high in all populations of II. brasiliensis sampled, and all rearrangements appeared to be in Hardv-Weinberg proportions, corroborating the hypothesis that chromosomal rearrangements are not strongly underdominant in this species. In H. vulpinus. 2n ranged from 35 to 39 and NF from 57 to 61. Two classes of variation were found in this spe cies: variation in the number, but not the kind, of supernumer ary chromosomes and variation in the amount of euchromatin.",

Each of these arms is unambiguously identifiable except one. which is provisionally labeled as 18 based on its size and morphology. Fifty-nine animals (48%) were heterozygous for a single Rb translocation, 16 animals (13%) were heterozygous for two Rb translocations, 2 animals (2%) were heterozygous for three Rb translocations, and the remaining 45 animals (37%) showed no heterozygosity for Rb translocations. One of the triple Rb heterozygotes (MWN 346 from Bahia Negra) contained monobrachial homologies (arm combinations: 1-1/2-2/18-18), based on G-banding; this finding was confirmed by an analysis of 100 meiotic metaphase cells. Supernumerary (B) chromosomes ( Fig. 3 ) have been divided into two categories on the basis of their size, shape, and staining characteristics (Nachman and Myers, 1989) . BI chromosomes are small to large, metacentric or submetacentric chromosomes that contain only centromeric heterochromatin (based on Cbanding) and therefore appear much like the autosomes. There is considerable variation in the size of BI chromosomes: the smallest are the size of autosome 23, and the largest are 40% larger than autosome 1, or approximately 10% of the length of the haploid genome. In contrast, BII chromosomes are small, acrocentric chromosomes that are largely heterochromatic (i.e., C-band positive). RBA-banding provides an unambiguous method of identifying B chromosomes in the karyotype: B chro mosomes replicate only after replication of all other autosomes Fig. 2 .

Be cause of the small size of the putative inversions, banding data provided little resolution, and the possibility that these rear rangements are due to either centromeric shifts or activation/inactivation of existing centromeres cannot be ruled out. Pericentric inversions have previously been described in Holochilus by Vidal and Riva (1978) and by Sangines and Aguilera (1991) . A pericentric inversion on one copy of autosome 11 (invl 1) was found in eight animals (7%), representing six of the seven populations. A pericentric inversion on a single X (invX) chromosome was found in one female (1 %) from the Golondrina population. The differences in amount of euchromatin can be described as additions relative to the most common karyotype, although there is no basis at present for identifying the ancestral condition and thereby determining whether chromatin has been lost or gained. Nine animals (7%), representing four populations, had terminal euchromatic additions (C-band negative, G-band negative) to the short arm of the X chromosome (eaX), and two animals (2%) from the Golondrina population had euchro-matic additions (C-band negative. G-band positive) adjacent to the centromere on the major arm of autosome 17 (eal 7).",

The karyotype contains six pairs of large metacentric or subme- Table I. tacentric chromosomes, whose arms are readily identifiable with G-banding (1/2. 3/4. 5/6, 7/9, 8/10. and 11/13). lour pairs of medium-sized metacentric or submetacentric chromosomes, whose arms are not easily identified with G-banding. a single small, metacentric pair which appears to be homologous with autosome 23 in H. brasiliensis, six pairs of small acrocentric autosomes, and acrocentric X and Y chromosomes. The acro centric short arms are frequently visible on the X chromosome, but not on the Y. As in H. brasiliensis, the X is approximately the size of autosome 6, and the Y is approximately the size of autosome 16. C-banding reveals that the autosomes and X chro mosome possess only centromeric heterochromatin, but that the Y chromosome is largely heterochromatic, as previously re ported for this taxon (Freitas et al.. 1983) . Variation within and between the two populations of H. nilpinus (Table II) results from two kinds of changes: variation in the number of BI1 chromosomes and variation in the amount of euchromatin. Six karyotypes were present among the 24 ani mals (2n = 35-39. NF = 57-61). All B chromosomes were small, acrocentric, and largely heterochromatic. Seven animals (29%) had a single BII chromosome, 3 (13%) had two BII chromo somes. 2 (8%) had three BII chromosomes, and the remaining 12 (50%) had no B chromosomes. An addition of euchromatin (relative to the most common condition) to the short arm of one X chromosome was detected in a single female from Las Cue vas.

Although the finding of extensive heterozygosity falsifies the hypothesis of strong underdominance, the finding of chromosomally monomorphic populations (as was found for II. vulpinus with respect to Rb mutations) neither corroborates nor falsifies the same hypothesis. This is because if chromosomal mutations are selectively neutral, then the degree of polymor phism in a population will depend on the mutation rate and V,,.

If heterozygotes are not selected against, they may be either neutral or at a selective advantage. Distinguishing between these alternatives is difficult, especially if selection coefficients are small. If chromosomal rearrange ments are sufficiently heterotic, then the frequencies of hetero zygotes may exceed those expected under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, as demonstrated by Baker et al. (1983) . If rearran gements are neutral, then the frequencies of polymorphisms are determined by the mutation rate and genetic drift. In a neutral model, the high level of polymorphism observed in H. brasilien sis could be explained by a high mutation rate. Alternatively, it could be explained by population dynamics that permit the ran dom fixation of alternative homozygous forms in small isolated demes for brief periods, followed by periods of expansion, dur ing which these demes interbreed. It is possible that this type of population structure exists in some parts of the range of H. bra siliensis. Marsh rats are strictly limited to aquatic habitats. In the Chaco region of Argentina and Paraguay, the seasonal envi ronment results in extensive expansion and contraction of marshes. During wet periods, many of these marshes intercon nect, but during dry periods, many small marshes are isolated from each other by large expanses of extremely arid land, which is unsuitable for II. brasiliensis.",

They have proposed that the 2n = 56 karyotypes of central Brazil are ancestral and that a gradual reduction in diploid number links the central Brazilian populations with the lower-diploid-number populations known from Argentina. However, the results from this study indicate that such a pattern is not observed and that, on the contrary, the diploid numbers of the northern four populations are lower (2n = 48-51) than the diploid numbers of the southern three populations (2n = 51-56). This suggests a more complicated picture of chromosomal evolution than pre viously envisioned. The populations of H. brasiliensis sampled here range from 20\u00b0 S to 31\" S latitude and cover a wide transi tional area between different ecological zones. The northern population lies within the tropics, is near the Mato Grosso of Brazil, and is associated with a fauna and flora that are similar to those found in the Amazon basin. The southern population, in contrast, shares little of the tropical fauna and flora and is in a temperate-subtropical region. Dobzhanskv (1970) and Nevo et al. (1988) have argued that correlations between general features of the abiotic environment (e.g.. temperature, rainfall, eleva tion) and features of the karyotype may indicate adaptations of particular chromosomal combinations to particular environ ments. Despite the substantial chromosomal variation found, there is no evidence for such correlations among populations of II. brasiliensis.",
