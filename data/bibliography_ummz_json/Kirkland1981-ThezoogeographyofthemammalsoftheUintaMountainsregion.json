                "text": "Because of the unusual east-west orientation, large size, and semi-isolated position of the Uinta Mountains, this region is exceptionally well suited for studying the effects of mountains on the distribution and systematics of mammals. The zoogeographic significance of the Uintas for mammals is revealed in the fact that they coincide with the boundary between two of the North American mammal provinces proposed by Hagmeier (1966) . The distinctiveness of the mammalian faunas of the Uinta Mountains and adjacent Bridger and Uinta basins was documented by Durrant (1952) , who designated these areas as three of Utah's mammalian provinces. Armstrong (1977) later classified the Uinta Mountains as a faunal subcenter and the two basins as faunal provinces. Both Durrant and Armstrong examined the mammals of Utah in general, but neither focused specifically on the regio Findley and Anderson (1956) have described the role played by the Uintas the biogeography of the montane mammals of Colorado. In addition, previous surveys of mammals in the Uintas, such as those of Svihla (1931 Svihla ( , 1932 , Reynolds (1966) , and Dearden (1967) , have been limited to specific areas within the mountains. Thus, no study has provided a comprehensive zoogeographic analysis of the mammals of the Uinta Mountains and adjacent basins. In this paper, I present such an analysis based in part on data collected during two summers of field work in the Uintas (1976) (1977) 1976 1977 and September of 1976 . In all, 872 specimens of 27 species were collected at 21 localities five counties in Utah (Daggett, Duchesne, Summit, Uintah, and Wasatch) and in Uinta County Wyoming. All specimens were deposited in the research mammal collection of the Verteb Museum (SSC). Distributional and habitat data for these specimens were supplemented by from specimens at the University of Utah (UU); Carnegie Museum of Natural History (CM the Museum of Natural History, University of Kansas (KU); the Museum of Zoology, Universit Michigan (UMMZ); and the National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution (USNM).",

These records might correspond to extralimital occurrences frequently recorded for birds (Udvardy, 1960) . Reynolds (1966) suggested that Pipistrellus may have reached Daggett County by following the Green River northward. The same also may be true for Antrozous.

During this study, three specimens were collected 9.6 km S Manila, Daggett Co., at 2,400 m, but no evidence of this species was found on the south slope in adjacent Uintah County. The Wyoming ground squirrel (Spermophilus elegans) is a campestrian species which is morphologically similar to the Uinta ground squirrel (Spermophilus armatus). The ranges of these two species meet at the lower elevations of the north slope of the Uintas (Howell, 1938) . The white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) is widespread throughout much of the United States, but is absent from the Southwest (Hall and Kelson, 1959) . There are records of O. virginianus from the Bridger Basin at Green River and Fort Bridger, Wyoming (Miller and Kellogg, 1955) , but this species has not been reported from the Uinta Mountains (Durrant, 1952; Reynolds, 1966; Dearden, 1967) . It should be remembered that subspecies boundaries are not absolute, but generally represent zones of sharp character gradients between populations, suggesting a partial disruption of gene flow. Although the distributional limits of subspecies in the Uintas tend to vary among the species, some patterns are evident.",

Finley (1958) synonymized N. c. cinnamomea with N. c. arizonae and gave this latter subspecies a continuous distribution from southern Wyoming through eastern Utah into northern Arizona and New Mexico. Reynolds (1966) and Armstrong (1972) have employed Finley's taxonomy in their analyses of N. cinerea from Daggett County, Utah, and western Colorado, respectively. However, Reynolds (1966) found intergrades between N. c. arizonae and N. c. orolestes and intergrades between N. c. arizonae and N. c. acraia among specimens from Daggett County. In examining a limited series of specimens (UU, CMNH, SSC), I have observed that specimens from Daggett County tend to have a slightly darker ochraceous dorsal pelage with a darker dorsal wash when compared with specimens from Uintah County.",

These are derived from three subspecies complexes whose members' ranges meet in the Uintas (Kelson, 1951) . Kelson (1951) notes that the multiple origins of the subspecies of T. talpoides in the Uintas have resulted in their being more differentiated from each other than are subspecies in the central mountains of Utah. T. t. ravus, a montane race in the \"bridgeri\" complex, appears to have evolved in situ in the Uintas (Durrant, 1952) and is confined to higher elevations. The western Bridger Basin and adjacent foothills of the Uintas are occupied by T. t. bridgeri. The western Uinta Basin and southern slopes of the Uintas are included within the range of T. t. uinta, a member of the \"wasatchensis\" complex. T. t. wasatchensis is found in the Wasatch Range and on the western flanks of the Uintas. The range of T. t. ocius in the \"ocius\" complex includes the drier lowland sagebrush areas of much of the Uinta and Bridger basins as well as adjacent western Colorado.. Kelson (1951) believes that the presence of T. t. ocius between the Uintas and the mountains of Colorado has prevented the spread westward into the Uintas of subspecies of T. talpoides occurring in the mountains of central Colorado. Thus, the T. talpoides in the Uintas have reached the mountains from the north and the west.",

In both squirrels, the subspecies found in the Uintas are the same as those occurring in central and western Colorado and are different from the subspecies found in the Wasatch Range. Intergrades between the Uinta and Wasatch mountains subspecies of T. hudsonicus have been reported from Summit County (Dearden, 1967) . In Peromyscus maniculatus, there is an altitudinal zonation of subspecies in the Uintas. P. m. rufinus is the darker montane race. It contrasts with the paler P. m. nebrascensis, which is primarily an inhabitant of drier communities at lower elevations in the Uintas and in the adjacent basins. Intergradation (or possibly interdigitation) between these races apparently takes place throughout the Uintas, and specimens assignable to P. m. nebrascensis were taken in this study at altitudes up to 2,800 m. Durrant (1952) Perognathus parvus is represented by P. p. clarus in the Bridger Basin and by P. p. olivaceous in the Uinta Basin (Hall and Kelson, 1959) . Because this species also is excluded from the Uintas, it will be discussed in detail in that All of these species are inhabitants of steppe-desert habitats characteristic of the Bridger and Uinta basins as well as western Colorado. With the exception of Lagurus curtatus, the distributions of these species appear to be confined to the basins. Lagurus was taken during this study in sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) communities at 2,400 m in Daggett County (five specimens, 9.5 km S Manila) and at 2,800 m in Summit County (seven specimens, 4.8 km ENE Bridger Lake).",

P. parvus apparently has reached the Bridger and Uinta basins from the Great Basin by circumventing the Wasatch Front to the north and south. Specimens of P. p. clarus from Daggett and Summit counties are distinctly different from P. parvus in Uintah and Duchesne counties. Thes latter specimens likewise are distinctly different from P. p. olivaceous from the Great Basin (UU, CMNH). Durrant (1952) suspected the presence of an unnamed subspecies of P. parvus east of central Utah even as he assigne specimens from 7 mi N Green River to P. p. olivaceous. Although Durrant and Lee (1956) subsequently described P. p. bullatus from Wayne Count west of the Green River, the specimens from Uintah and Duchesne countie examined in this study differ from topotypes of P. p. bullatus in having a greater distance between the bullae ventrally, being paler dorsally without an ochraceous-orange wash, and having more distinct post-auricular patches. These specimens from Uintah and Duchesne counties may be representatives of a still undescribed race of P. parvus from the Uintah Basin.",

Second, mountain ranges may sufficiently restrict gene flow between populations that recognizable subspecies are present on the opposite sides. Third, they may disrupt gene flow to such a limited extent that populations on opposite sides are insufficiently differentiated to warrant subspecific designation. Whether a lowland species is affected at level one, two, or three will be a function of its size, ecology, and dispersal capabilities, as well as the size, ecological characteristics, and age of the mountain range.",

The distinctiveness of the Bridger and Uinta basins is diminished by the fact that some lowland species have circumvented the mountains to the east. Seven species have used the Green River as a filter bridge to extend their ranges northward into the Bridger Basin (Table 3) This latter isolation probably has contributed to the subspecific differentia tion now evident between the Uintas and the Colorado Rockies in Ochotona princeps, Eutamias umbrinus, Clethrionomys gapperi, and Zapus princeps. Notwithstanding these differences, the closest affinities of the boreal mammals of central Colorado are with the boreal mammals of the Uintas (Findley and Anderson, 1956) .",

Members of these two faunal elements constitute 6 of the 12 species having subspecies boundaries in the Uintas. Four others are representatives of Armstrong's (1977) Widespread faunal element. For many of these species, the subspecific variation evident today may be attributable to the Pleistocene climate deteriorations which excluded mammals from the higher elevations of the Uintas, thereby tending to isolate populations and promote differentiation. The mammalian fauna of the Uintas is most closely allied to that of the adjacent Wasatch Mountains. Despite the proximity of these two mountain ranges, their mammalian faunas are sufficiently different that Durrant (1952) and Armstrong (1977) have designated them as separate provinces and subcenters, respectively, of Utah's mammalian fauna. Faunal differences between them include the separate subspecies for Tamiasciurus hudsonicus and Spermophilus lateralis in each mountain range and the apparent exclusion of Sorex vagrans from the Uintas.",

Of Armstrong's seven faunal elements, the Widespread element is the only one in which at least half of its species are classed as being unaffected in distribution and taxonomy by the Uintas.

It should be noted that not all the species are found in every habitat within the region. Nine of the 26 species (34.6%) are bats and should have sufficient dispersal capabilities to surmount or circumvent any barriers in the region. Ten of the species (38.5%) are carnivores and should not be restricted trophically to any particular plant community type as is sometimes the case with herbivores. Ondatra zibethicus and Lutra canadensis are semiaquatic and can exploit the streams draining the Uintas as well as the numerous lakes at the higher elevations. Erethizon dorsatum, Microtus longicaudus, and Marmota flaviventris hav a considerable altitudinal distribution. Erethizon frequently descends into the basins, possibly following riparian woodlands, and may be seen as road killed specimens in sagebrush communities.
