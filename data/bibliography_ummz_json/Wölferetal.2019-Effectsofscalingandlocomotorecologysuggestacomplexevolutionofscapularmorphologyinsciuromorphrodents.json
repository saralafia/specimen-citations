    "abstract": "Sciuromorph rodents are a monophyletic group comprising ~300 species that display a variety of locomotor behaviours and a body mass range spanning three orders of magnitude. We asked how the interaction of body mass and locomotor ecology affects the morphology of the scapula. Univariate traits and the shape of the scapula from the lateral view of 186 species were analysed. Fitting Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models to all univariate traits revealed phylogenetic inertia to be low. Hence, ordinary least squares regressions including an interaction term were used for all traits to test whether the scaling relationships differ in the fossorial and aerial groups when compared with the group characterized by arboreal locomotion, the most probable ancestral sciuromorph condition. We also asked whether the scaling of univariate traits departs from isometry in each of the three locomotor groups. The aerial group was expected to show the highest trait values for a given body mass and the highest slope values, followed by the arboreal and fossorial groups along this sequence. Only a few traits showed a difference in scaling among locomotor groups and/or a distinct allometric pattern. Discrepancies between our expectations and results are discussed in a morphofunctional context.",

Adjustments in the locomotor apparatus might occur not only specifically in response to changes in ecology or body mass, but also in response to the interaction of these factors (Steudel, 1982; Bou et al., 1987; Christiansen, 1999a) . For example, the degree of adjustment of a morphological variable for a given change in body mass might differ among locomotor behaviours, because the loading they impose on the morphology might change at a different rate with increasing body mass (Jungers, 1979) . This implies that the difference in the focal morphological variable is not constant among locomotor ecologies, but changes when compared across a range of body masses. In statistical terms, this would be manifested by groups with different locomotor ecologies displaying different slopes when the morphological variable is regressed against body mass. This has been shown to be the case for various morphological parameters relevant for locomotion (i.e. Jungers, 1979; Alexander et al., 1981; Steudel, 1982; Christiansen, 1999b; Hayssen, 2008) .",

They display arboreal, terrestrial, fossorial and aerial (albeit only in the form of passive gliding) locomotion (Nowak, 1999; Thorington et al., 2012) . Overall, their body masses span three orders of magnitude, with a large amount of overlap among various locomotor ecologies ( Fig. 1 ; Hayssen, 2008) . According to W\u00f6lfer et al.

The scapula is an understudied skeletal element in allometric studies (but see Lilje et al., 2003; Schmidt, 2008; Schmidt & Fischer, 2009) . This is surprising, because it serves as the attachment site for muscles that are known to be relevant for (i.e. are activated during) various locomotor activities in mammals (Cohen & Gans, 1975; English, 1978a, b; Larson & Stern, 1986) . The relevance of the scapula for locomotion in therian mammals is underlined by its integration into the forelimb, thus being the most proximal skeletal element that also contributes the most to the limb excursion during the stance phase (Jenkins, 1971; Fischer, 1994; Fischer et al., 2002) . We analysed the following quantitative skeletal variables (see Fig. 2 ): the effective length of the scapula; the size of the glenoid cavity; the size of the coracoid process and the length of the mediolateral in-lever of the muscles attaching to its tip (short biceps and coracobrachialis); the size of the teres major fossa and the size of the attachment sites; the lengths of the in-levers; and the orientation of the in-levers of the rotator cuff muscles (supraspinatus, infraspinatus and subscapularis). We also investigated the following features of scapular shape visible from the lateral view ( Fig. 2A ) that could not be quantified as linear variables: the length of the in-lever of the teres major fossa (interpreted from the position and shape of the fossa relative to the blade); and the robustness of the metacromion and acromion.",

W\u00f6lfer et al. (2019) assumed these categories to reflect the most demanding activities of the locomotor repertoire of a species acting on the femur. We hypothesized this categorization also to be reflected in the realizations of all scapular traits, although we did not make specific assumptions about the orientation of the in-levers of the rotator cuff muscles and the shape features. Specifically, we expected that the highest univariate trait values for a given body mass would be found in the aerial group, followed by the arboreal and the fossorial groups along this order. Furthermore, the differences in univariate trait values among the locomotor groups were expected to increase with body mass, thus yielding the highest slope values for the aerial group and the lowest values for the fossorial one.",

                "text": "Regarding the effective length of the scapula (Fig. 2B ), this decision was based on the following morphofunctional considerations based on limb bone geometry. Aerial sciuromorphs need longer limbs to increase the area of the patagium, and thus, increase lift during gliding (Thorington & Heaney, 1981; Runestad & Ruff, 1995) . Furthermore, scapular length should scale with positive allometry, because this has to be the case for the surface area of the patagium in order to yield similar lift properties (Runestad & Ruff, 1995) . Phylogenetic tree of all sciuromorph species covered in this analysis including ancestral locomotor types. The tree was adopted from Zelditch et al. (2015) and added with information from the TimeTree database (Hedges et al., 2015) . The timescale is in million years ago (Ma). Pie charts at the internal nodes present the probability of each locomotor type. Larger pie charts indicate transitions among locomotor types at the internal nodes. See main text for more information. Table S2 ). Small dark grey circles indicate curve landmarks. A, lateral view. Abbreviation: lm 4 , landmark 4. B, medial view. Small light grey circles indicate landmarks that were added for the calculation of the centroids (large light grey circles) of the supraspinatus (c 1 ), infraspinatus (c 2 ) and subscapularis (c 3 ) fossae. Large dark grey circles indicate positions of the three centroids when not taking into account the small light grey circle landmarks. Abbreviations: \u03b1 1 and \u03b1 2 , angles between the in-levers (I-L) and EL; EL, effective length of the scapula; I-L 1 and I-L 2 , in-levers of the supra-and infraspinatus muscles, respectively; lm 1 and lm 5 , landmarks representing the dorsal and ventral centres of rotation, respectively; lm 7 , landmark indicating the ventral end of the connection between spine and blade. In-levers and angles are not shown for the and it was already shown to be the case for the femoral length by W\u00f6lfer et al. (2019) . A shorter scapula for a given body mass was expected for arboreal species, because it would bring the centre of mass closer to the substrate, which is important for maintaining balance during climbing (Nakano, 2002; Schmidt & Fischer, 2011) . We did not make specific assumptions about the scaling of the effective scapular length in the arboreal group. Isometry seemed reasonable, because positive allometry would force the animals to climb in a relatively more crouched and energetically less efficient posture (Biewener, 1991) in order to bring the centre of mass closer to the substrate. An isometric scaling relationship has already been observed for the sciuromorph femur (W\u00f6lfer et al., 2019) . A fossorial sciuromorph of similar mass might possess the shortest scapula, because jumping is less important and shorter limb elements might facilitate locomotion in underground tunnels (Stein, 2000) . W\u00f6lfer et al. (2019) found a negative allometric pattern in the effective femoral length of the fossorial group, which we adopted as a hypothesis for the scapula. This pattern would allow the animal to minimize the tunnel size with increasing body mass (W\u00f6lfer et al., 2019) . Regarding the glenoid cavity and the muscle attachment sites (Fig. 2) , the locomotor categorization was based on the assumption that the glenoid cavity is adapted to the resistance of peak loadings and the scapular muscles to the generation of peak forces that occur during the interactions of the animal with its environment. These loadings and forces are most probably highest for aerial sciuromorphs, because of gliding locomotion and landing impacts after long glides. This assumption is based on the experimental data of Paskins et al. (2007) , which demonstrated that landing reaction forces of a small flying squirrel (~0.25 kg) can increase up to almost nine times the body weight of the animal after a flight distance of only 2 m. Peak loadings and forces that occur during digging behaviour and terrestrial locomotion were assumed to be lowest, and those generated by arboreal locomotion (climbing vertically and jumping from tree to tree) to lie in between. The assumed differences between the arboreal and fossorial species was based on a study by Stalheim-Smith (1984) , who observed that selected forelimb muscles produced higher torques in an arboreal sciuromorph species (Sciurus niger) when compared with a heavier fossorial species (Cynomys gunnisoni). Expectations were difficult to formulate for the orientations of the in-levers of the rotator cuff muscles (supraspinatus, infraspinatus and subscapularis), but we included them because we observed the shape of the supraspinatus fossa, in particular, to vary tremendously among arboreal species.",

The coracoid process was always visible from the medial, caudal and ventral views ( Fig. 2B-D) . In each view, the landmarks surrounding the process were used to compute the respective centroid size. The three values were then summed to yield a measure for its overall centroid size. The mediolateral component of the in-lever was measured in the caudal and ventral views, respectively (Fig. 2C, D ). An average value was computed, because both values were correlated, but differed for higher values especially (Supporting Information, Fig. S2 ). Regarding the caudal view, initially, the in-lever in the caudal plane ( Fig.  2C ) was determined as the distance between the landmark at the tip of the coracoid process and the centre between the two landmarks representing the mediolateral width of the glenoid cavity. Then, a vector from this centre to landmark 5 was computed, which represented the mediolateral axis of the scapula. Afterwards, the angle enclosed by the in-lever and the mediolateral axis was calculated using the formula of the dot product. It was finally used to obtain the mediolateral component of the in-lever, which equals the length of the in-lever multiplied by the cosine of the angle. Regarding the ventral view, the scapula was photographed so that the craniocaudal axis (judged from the appearance of the blade; Fig. 2D ) aligned with the y-axis of the image. Hence, the mediolateral axis was aligned with the x-axis. This allowed us to calculate the mediolateral component of the in-lever ( Fig. 2D ) as the distance between the x-coordinates of the landmark at the tip of the coracoid and the centre between the landmarks 1 and 3. These landmarks represented the mediolateral width of the glenoid cavity (corresponding to landmarks 5 and 6 in Fig. 2C ).",

In most species, the teres major fossa was separated by a ridge on the lateral view, making it easy to identify its medial border (compare Fig. 2A , C). However, this was not always the case; therefore, we used the following procedure to estimate the medial outline of the teres major attachment area. If the ridge was present, it represented a continuation of the caudal margin of the scapular blade straight to the dorsal top ( Fig. 2A) . When the ridge was not present, we placed the ventral fixed landmark of the teres major fossa (landmark 4) where the outline of the caudal margin started to turn laterally around its dorsal area. This landmark was used as a starting point to place the curve landmarks all along to the dorsal margin so that this line of landmarks extended the caudal margin dorsally (as the ridge did otherwise). We computed the centroid size using the landmarks surrounding the fossa. The in-lever was not quantified, because the glenoid cavity was not visible on the lateral view. However, some conclusions were drawn from the comparative shape analysis (see section 'Shape analysis'). It is important to note that the attachment site identified here does not necessarily correspond fully to the real attachment site. For example, Thorington et al. (1997) reported that the origin of teres major generally extends along one-to two-thirds of the length of the caudal margin, while not referring to a specific locomotor group or species, etc. We never observed the fossa to extend that far ventrally, indicating that the muscle might attach to the caudal margin of the scapula further ventrally. Muscle dissections would be necessary to assess the correct attachment area but are not manageable on a large-scale comparative analysis including > 150 sciuromorph species, because such specimens are less available than skeletal elements in museum collections. However, the teres major fossa has been used to infer the functional relevance of the attaching muscles (e.g. Hildebrand & Goslow, 1995) , and we assume that it also represents a good indicator in the Sciuromorpha.",

Given that the scapular blade approximates a flat structure, we simply defined the supraspinatus and infraspinatus fossae as the two areas that are obtained when splitting the subscapularis fossa by the line connecting landmarks 1 and 7. In order to yield accurate in-levers, it was necessary to achieve a uniform surrounding of the fossae with landmarks. Hence, we added additional landmarks. Given that the density of curve landmarks differed between the supraspinatus fossa and the infraspinatus fossa, the density of added landmarks was adjusted according to the fossa under consideration (lower density for the supraspinatus fossa and higher density for infraspinatus fossa). Regarding the supraspinatus fossa, we calculated the distance between two neighbouring curve landmark points. Then, we computed the distances between landmarks 1 and 7 and between landmarks 7 and 6 ( Fig.  2B ). These two distances were divided by the distance between the two neighbouring curve landmark points. The resulting number of points was used to interpolate the landmark coordinates between landmark 1 and 7 and between landmarks 7 and 6, respectively. All landmarks surrounding the supraspinatus fossa, including these added ones, were used to compute the position and size of its centroid. The same procedure was applied to the infraspinatus fossa, with the only difference being the fixed landmarks used (landmarks 1, 2, 3 and 7). Note that in Figure 2B , the two lines of added landmarks stretching from landmark 1 to landmark 7 are shifted a bit to the left (supraspinatus fossa) and right (infraspinatus fossa) to enhance visibility.",

Given that inclusion of locomotor type as a fixed factor might bias the MPCF value towards one, we also accounted for the scenario of all species sharing the same optimum (no effect of locomotor type on the univariate trait).

The function mvBM of the R package mvMORPH (Clavel et al., 2015 ) was used to fit the BM model, and the function slouch.fit was used for the other two models. The likelihood of all three models was then compared via the Schwarz information criterion (SIC), which penalizes the model likelihood with the number of parameters estimated and the number of species included (Burnham & Anderson, 2002) . Lower SIC values were interpreted as higher model likelihood sensu Burnham & Anderson (2002) . We found the BM model to be more likely (SIC = 321) than the OU model including locomotor type as a fixed effect (SIC = 331) and the OU model with a single optimum (SIC = 324).

Furthermore, the slouch model can be fitted only to univariate traits. However, given that all univariate traits yielded a very high MPCF (see Results and Table 1 ), we decided that not only the univariate aspects of scapular shape, but also overall shape displays a fast adaptive response to locomotor type and body mass, justifying the use of OLS regressions for univariate traits in addition to shape (see W\u00f6lfer et al., 2019) . In order to assess the effect of the image acquisition technique, the OLS analysis with univariate traits and shape was redone, this time including the mean value for Tamias striatus derived from the data of the 20 photographs and the mean value computed with the data of the 20 snapshots taken from the threedimensional (3D) surface model. We replicated the graphs presented in Figures 3 and 4 and highlighted these two data points to assess visually the occurrence of a systematic error for the univariate traits ( Supporting Information, Figs S3, S4 ). To visualize the error concerning the shape analysis, we first used the procD.allometry function of the R package geomorph (Adams et al., 2018) to repeat the multivariate regression. Then, a regression plot ( Supporting Information, Fig. S5 ) was generated using the plot.procD.allometry function of the same package with the method 'RegScore' to project multivariate shape onto the y-axis sensu Drake & Klingenberg (2008) .",

This indicates a very low phylogenetic inertia, and thus, almost instantaneous adaptation on a phylogenetic timescale. Only the orientations of the in-levers of the rotator cuff muscles displayed a lower score. The orientation of the in-lever of the supraspinatus muscle had the lowest score (~0.82), with increasing values for the infraspinatus and subscapularis muscles (~0.89 and ~0.98, respectively). This might be attributable to the larger scatter of the data points when comparing the orientation of the in-levers with the other traits (Figs 3, 4 ). Nevertheless, we considered the MPCF value high enough to rely on OLS regressions for the estimation of model parameters.

Intercepts (IC) and slopes (SL) of the ordinary least squares (OLS) fits with their upper confidence limits (UCL) and corresponding P-values (P). Variables without a significant interaction effect (see Table 1 ) are represented by a single common slope reported under the arboreal group. Actual slope values and not the differences of the fossorial and aerial groups relative to the arboreal group are presented in order to facilitate comparison with isometry. For consistency, the same applies to the intercepts. See Table 1 for abbreviated variable names. P-values for the slopes of the fossorial and aerial groups refer to the significance of being different from the slope of the arboreal group.

The last of these might be attributed to similarities in certain relative changes with regard to centroid size occurring from the expected shapes of the lightest aerial/arboreal species to the expected shapes of the heaviest aerial/ arboreal species (Fig. 5) : a ventral lengthening of the teres major fossa, a shallower outline of the dorsal part of the supraspinatus fossa, an extension of the dorsal infraspinatus margin, and a reduction of the craniocaudal width of the infraspinatus fossa. According to the slope angles, the changes in the fossorial group were more similar to those of the arboreal group (angle ~72.7\u00b0) than to the changes found in the aerial group (angle ~82.2\u00b0).

                "text": "The purpose of this study was to analyse how the interplay of locomotor ecology and body mass affects the morphology of the sciuromorph scapula and to evaluate whether the scaling relationships conform to or depart from the theory of isometry. We intended to assess the adaptive significance of these relationships by estimating the influence of phylogenetic inertia on scapular trait evolution. Overall, the results suggest that most of the studied traits display very low phylogenetic inertia and scale with or very close to isometry. The low phylogenetic inertia indicates that this isometric scaling trend has an adaptive significance that needed to be sustained during sciuromorph evolution. This is in accordance with the results of W\u00f6lfer et al. (2019) , who found that most of the femoral traits displayed a low phylogenetic inertia and scaled close to isometry. Only the centroid size of the teres major and the orientation of the in-levers of the rotator cuff muscles with respect to the axis defined by the effective scapular length displayed a distinct allometric pattern. The orientations of the in-levers of the infra-and supraspinatus fossae showed lower phylogenetic inertia (~0.82 and ~0.89, respectively). Nevertheless, these values are still far closer to one than to zero, suggesting that the allometric scaling patterns reflect adaptation to locomotor ecology and body mass rather than phylogenetic inertia. The centroid size of the caudal area of the glenoid cavity, the scapular shape (analysed from the lateral view) and the in-levers of the rotator cuff muscles exhibited a significant interaction effect, i.e. a discrepancy of scaling properties among locomotor groups. However, contrary to our expectations for the univariate traits, differences among locomotor groups never increased, but changed depending on the body mass as indicated by the crossing of the slopes for the groups at the midrange of body mass (Figs 3, 4) . Consequently, the tests concerning the differences in the intercepts are not informative for these cases. Despite this, we found significant differences among locomotor groups that partly did and partly did not match our assumptions, as discussed below. Several studies have been carried out concerning the shape of the scapula (e.g. G\u00e1lvez-L\u00f3pez & Casinos, 2008; Astua, 2009; Morgan, 2009; Mart\u00edn-Serra et al., 2014) , but the application of geometric morphometrics does not allow comparison of the dimensions of substructures on an absolute scale. Regarding absolute scapular length, Lilje et al. (2003) reported positive allometry in bovids and cervids. We did not find an allometric relationship. In fact, the slightly negative slope we found for all species indicates that the scapular length is not prone to functional adjustments in heavier sciuromorphs. Perhaps, if necessary, adjustments in stride length are accomplished instead by changes in the rotational and translational movement of this forelimb element. We could not confirm a generally smaller length for the scapula as demonstrated for the femur by W\u00f6lfer et al. (2019) when comparing the fossorial with the arboreal group. It is interesting that the effective length of the aerial group is significantly smaller than that of the arboreal group. This was already observed by Polyakova & Sokolov (1965) when comparing the gliding species Pteromys volans with the arboreal species Sciurus vulgaris (although it has to be kept in mind that they standardized scapular length by body length and not body mass). An increase in the area of the patagium to increase lift seems to be achieved mostly by increasing the length of the stylo-and zeugopodia of the forelimb (see Thorington & Heaney, 1981) .",

                "text": "The pattern in the robustness of the glenoid cavity only met our expectations in part. Although an interaction effect was found for the caudal region, differences in scaling effects are minor. Furthermore, the crossing of slopes at the mid-range of body mass hampers the interpretation of differences among intercepts, because these differences disappear during the mid-range and are inverted for higher body masses. The trait values of the lightest arboreal and aerial species might generally be biased a bit towards higher values, because these were acquired from 3D surface model snapshots. This might lower the slope of these groups and might be responsible for this interaction effect. This has to be kept in mind for the other three univariate traits discussed below that appear to be affected by the imaging technique. The allometric scaling pattern in the caudal region of the glenoid cavity in the fossorial group might hint at an increased importance for stability and regulation of load transfer in the shoulder joint during digging. An importance for the robustness of various forelimb articulation sites in diggers has already been formulated by others for various mammalian taxa (Hildebrand & Goslow, 1995; Polly, 2007; Samuels & Van Valkenburgh, 2008; Morgan & \u00c1lvarez, 2013; Fabre et al., 2015) . However, the cranial area of the glenoid suggests that this region is especially important for gliders, because we found it to be most robust in this group. It might stabilize the shoulder during gliding and/or landing by reducing the displacement of the humerus when forces act onto it. Dedicated biomechanical analyses of the shoulder joint during locomotion are necessary to test this hypothesis. The different pattern in the cranial and caudal regions of the glenoid cavity suggest the possibility that the cavity does not evolve as a whole, but might consist of two separate functional units that are not correlated developmentally, at least in Sciuromorpha.",

The robustness might be an indicator of the need to stabilize the position of the scapula during gliding, because the clavicula and the dorsal area of the coracoid process are tightly connected via ligaments. The relatively high in-lever component increases the adductor forces created by the coracobrachialis and short biceps muscles (the latter, however, primarily being a flexor of the elbow joint). This adjustment might assist the counterbalancing of torques tending to fold the limbs upwards during gliding in addition to absorbing impact forces during landing (Essner & Scheibe, 2002) . As expected, both features are smallest in the fossorial group, and the arboreal group fits in between the other two. This confirms our assumption that neither digging nor terrestrial locomotion requires particularly large adductor forces, but that these forces play an important role for maintaining balance on slender and inclined substrates and assist vertical climbing on tree trunks (Taylor, 1974; Grand, 1983; Argot, 2001; Sargis, 2002) . The isometric or almost isometric scaling of both parameters suggests that allometric adjustments did not occur during the evolution of sciuromorphs. Perhaps, scaling adjustments regarding the adductor function are found in muscles with an overall larger in-lever (e.g. pectoralis muscles).",

                "text": "The fossa of the teres major, which is a muscle that retracts the forelimb, is generally considered to play an important role during digging (Hildebrand & Goslow, 1995) . According to the differences in the centroid sizes of our three locomotor groups, it is least important for diggers and equally important for arboreal and aerial species. Stalheim-Smith (1984) compared the amount of torque generated by the teres major muscle at different shoulder joint angles between the arboreal sciuromorph species S. niger and the fossorial sciuromorph species C. gunnisoni. The author showed that the only significant difference could be found for 145\u00b0, with S. niger displaying the higher value (Stalheim-Smith, 1984) . A comparison with recorded data of S. niger climbing vertically indicated that this angle occurs during the early retraction phase when the animal pulls itself upwards (Stalheim-Smith, 1984) . The finding that teres major functions as a retractor during climbing is supported by an electromyography study on chimpanzees (Larson & Stern, 1986) . Hence, a strongly developed teres major fossa does not only have to represent an adaptation in the context of a fossorial lifestyle. The fact that aerial species are similar to the arboreal ones not only concerning the size of the fossa, but also its shape, indicates that the demands are very similar. This is reasonable, because gliding sciuromorphs still have to climb trees effectively besides also being adapted for gliding capabilities and most probably evolved from arboreal ancestors (Mercer & Roth, 2003; Herron et al., 2004; Steppan et al., 2004) . The positive allometric scaling of the teres major fossa when compared with the other attachment sites considered in the present study hints at the functional importance of the attaching muscle to counterbalance the disproportionate increase of weight in all three groups. However, the ventral lengthening of the fossae in the arboreal and aerial groups with increasing body mass would move the centroids of the fossae further ventrally and reduce the length of the in-levers when compared with the fossorial group (Fig. 5) . Nevertheless, the effective scapular length is larger in the arboreal group than in the aerial one, counterbalancing the ventral shift. This makes it difficult to interpret differences among the lengths of the in-levers of the teres major among the three groups. Quantitative data are needed to interpret differences among the in-levers reliably.",

This is in accordance with the findings of other authors, who compared arboreal and terrestrial taxa and assigned the role of these muscles to the stabilization of the shoulder joint during powerful, extensive retractions of the arm while climbing (Roberts, 1974; Argot, 2001) . We expected that the rotator cuff muscles have to generate the largest forces when stabilizing the shoulder joint during gliding or loading impacts while landing when compared with other locomotor behaviours in sciuromorphs. The supraspinatus muscle, in particular, is an important elevator and protractor of the arm (Larson & Stern, 1986) . Perhaps its most commanding function is a fast protraction of the arm during vertical climbing. A larger supraspinatus in arboreal species might indicate that aerial species are less agile climbers. The biggest change in the orientation of the in-lever of supraspinatus with body mass was found in the arboreal group (~6\u00b0; Table 3 ). This is a very subtle difference when compared with the shape changes in the supraspinatus fossa (Fig. 5) . A cranial rotation of the in-lever in the heaviest species compared with the smallest species indicates that the supraspinatus muscle of the former develops comparable torques to that of the latter when the shoulder joint is flexed by an additional ~6\u00b0. In other words, the heavier species might display a larger range of motion in the shoulder joint, and the supraspinatus muscle might be optimized to act on a further retracted arm. However, to our knowledge, no data are available to support this assumption.",

Interestingly, Larson & Stern (1986) found it to be activated during arm lifting/protraction, but not retraction in the chimpanzee, which contradicts our assumption. It remains to be evaluated whether muscle activation patterns are comparable between arboreal sciuromorphs and highly derived primates, such as chimpanzees. Furthermore, chimpanzees display a much larger infraspinatus fossa when compared with the supraspinatus fossa (Sch\u00fcck, 1910) , which is not the case for sciuromorphs. Surprisingly, fossorial sciuromorphs displayed the largest change in the orientation of the in-lever of infraspinatus with body mass, which is difficult to interpret. Contrary to the orientation of the in-lever of supraspinatus, a caudal rotation of the in-lever of infraspinatus would indicate that, in the heaviest species, this muscle develops comparable torques to the lightest species, when the shoulder joint is extended by an additional ~2.5\u00b0. To our knowledge, it has not yet been tested whether small and large fossorial species differ in the range of motion of their shoulder joint during digging. The smaller rotator cuff fossae in the fossorial group compared with the arboreal group contradict the idea that fossorial locomotion applies higher loads onto the shoulder joint than arboreal locomotion (Hildebrand & Goslow, 1995; Polly, 2007; Samuels & Van Valkenburgh, 2008; Morgan & \u00c1lvarez, 2013; Fabre et al., 2015) .

                "text": "The results reveal a complex evolution of the sciuromorph scapula, during which allometric adjustments appear to have played a minor role. Nevertheless, some traits that were considered in the present study displayed an interaction effect between locomotor ecology and body mass, highlighting the importance of accounting statistically for potential interaction effects in ecomorphological studies (W\u00f6lfer et al., 2019) . Discrepancies between our expectations and the adjustments of scapular traits to different locomotor ecologies that we found suggest that it is import to take a closer look at the biomechanics of locomotion in order to understand their morphological demands (Bock, 1980) . They could also hint at the presence of morphofunctional trade-offs, because the low phylogenetic inertia indicates that trait values are close to their primary optimum, thus representing locomotor adaptations. The fossorial group serves as a prime example, with some adjustments indicating adaptation to the stabilization of the shoulder joint (caudal region of the glenoid cavity, metacromion) and other aspects contradicting this interpretation (sizes of rotator cuff muscle attachment sites). Also notable is their reduced fossa of the teres major, a muscle that has usually been related to the powerful arm retraction during digging behaviour (Lehmann, 1963; Hildebrand & Goslow, 1995) . Thus, our analysis exemplifies the lack of a one-to-one correspondence between morphology and function (see Wainwright et al., 2005) . Quantitative scaling analyses of the various scapular features in other mammalian taxa and studies focusing on their anatomical integration are needed to understand the adaptive significance and limitations of scapular adjustments with changes in body mass and locomotor ecology. of the scapular perspectives in Geomagic studio (3D Systems, Rock Hill, SC, USA): reference (a), lateral (b), medial (c), caudal (d) and ventral (e) perspectives. Note that the reference perspective fulfils the criteria in the pictogram of the lateral perspective in A and was rotated stepwise by 90\u00b0 to yield the four orthogonal perspectives. The scale bar was placed upon flat structures of the objects (stretching from point 1 to point 2). Figure S2 . Correlation of mediolateral in-lever of short biceps and coracobrachialis muscles as measured from the caudal and ventral perpsectives. Abbreviation: cor, Pearson's correlation coefficient. Figure S3 . Modification of Figure 3 , including the mean trait values of Tamias striatus for two image acquisition techniques. The scaling patterns for various natural log-transformed univariate traits on natural log-transformed body mass are presented. The grey bar always indicates the slope under isometry. Three slopes for the different locomotor groups are shown in the case of a significant interaction effect, and one slope (black) for all species in the case of no interaction effect. See Supporting Information, Table S3 for explanations of parameter abbreviations and see main text for more details. Figure S4 . Modification of Figure 4 , including the mean trait values of Tamias striatus for two image acquisition techniques. The scaling patterns for various natural log-transformed univariate traits on natural log-transformed body mass are presented. See Supporting Information, Table S3 for explanations of parameter abbreviations, and see Supporting Information, Figure S3 and main text for more details. Figure S5 . Regression plot of scapular shape (lateral view) on log body mass, including the mean trait values of Tamias striatus for two image acquisition techniques. The scaling pattern of shape on natural log-transformed body mass is presented. The regression score is a univariate representative of multivariate shape (see Drake & Klingenberg, 2008) . Table S1 . List of sampled specimens. Collection names are abbreviated as follows: AMNH, American Museum of National History (New York City, NY); CeNaK, Centrum f\u00fcr Naturkunde (Hamburg); FM, The Field Museum of Natural History (Chicago, IL); MNHN, Museum national d'Histoire naturelle (Paris); MSU, Michigan State University Museum (East Lansing, MI); PMJ, Phyletisches Museum (Jena); SMF, Senckenberg Museum (Frankfurt); SMNS, Staatliches Museum f\u00fcr Naturkunde (Stuttgart); SNMNH, Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History (Washington, DC); UMMZ, University of Michigan Museum of Zoology (Ann Arbor, MI); ZMB, Museum f\u00fcr Naturkunde (Berlin); ZSM, Zoologische Staatssammlung (M\u00fcnchen). In the column 'Phylogeny', it is indicated whether a species is represented in our phylogeny used for phylogenetic generalized least squares. 'NA' indicates missing information for the sex or body mass of a specimen. The column 'Sex of body mass specimens' indicates from which sex/sexes the body mass information was taken if not available for the specific sex of the sampled specimen. If the sex of the sampled specimen was unknown (NA), the mean body mass value of all information provided in the reference was computed. Body mass information was taken primarily from Hayssen (2008) ; otherwise, as indicated by the column 'Body mass reference'. The column 'Method' refers to the image acquisition technique. Table S2 . Landmark definitions for the scapular perspectives. Positions of landmark numbers (LM No.) can be observed in Supporting Information, Figure S1 . Table S3 . ANOVA tables. Abbreviations: ca, from caudal view; CS, centroid; DF, degrees of freedom; EL, effective length; F, F-ratio; I-L, in-lever; ml, mediolateral; I-L ori , orientation of the in-lever with respect to the axis of scapula EL; la, shape from the lateral view; MS, mean squares; Pr(>MS), probability of MS being larger than under the assumption of a simpler model not containing that specific effect (mass, groups and mass:groups, respectively, with the last of these indicating the interaction effect between mass and groups); Rsq, coefficient of determination; SS, sum of squares; ve, from ventral view; Z, Z-score.",
