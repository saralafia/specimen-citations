The pattern of enzyme activities in these tissues suggests that these muscles differ qualitatively with other mammalian and avian muscles in two respects. First, the muscles of all 10 bat species were much more highly oriented toward fat metabolism and away from glucose metabolism than in any previously measured skeletal muscle. Second, the species were divided into two major groups with respect to hexokinase activity. Primarily frugivorous species had hexokinase activities about 2-3 times as high as insectivorous species. It is suggested that the weight restrictions of flight limit glycogen storage and thus bias muscle metabolism toward fat. However, the extent to which pectoralis muscles have the capacity for glucose oxidation appears to be dependent on the intake of dietary glucose.",

The relative importance of these substrates has been the subject of a great deal of study. Direct measurements of uptake and oxidation of glucose and fatty acids by working muscles in vivo have been limited to large mammals (1, 2, 32, 33) . Most comparative studies dealing with fuel utilization in muscles of small birds and mammals have been based on measurements of key enzymes of catabolic pathways (3, 4, 11, 1524) . In all birds and mammals thus far examined the enzymes catalyzing the aerobic oxidation of glucose and fatty acids exist in constant activity ratios to those of the citric acid cycle (4, 27). Enzymes catalyzing glycogenolysis and glycolysis typically occur in inverse proportion to citric acid cycle enzymes (4, 8). These proportions are similar in muscles of a variety of fiber compositions from a number of species (27). These proportions also remain constant during endurance training where increased aerobic capacity is the result of coordinated increases in enzyme activities in a number of pathways (15). It has been suggested that the constant ratios of the capacities for glucose oxidation and fatty acid oxidation relative to citric acid cycle capacity represent a basic nonvarying metabolic organization in skeletal muscle (4).",

                "text": "The purpose of this paper is to examine the metabolic organization of the pectoralis muscles of neotropical bats, representing a broad spectrum of activity patterns and feeding strategies. We hypothesized that fuel utilization by pectoralis muscles of bats might deviate from the pattern of other mammalian muscles for reasons related to dietary specialization and the energetic requirements of flight. Flight requires a very high rate of energy input. Maximum metabolic rates of birds (29) and bats (28) may be 2-3 times those of similarly sized terrestrial mammals. This is reflected in the high activities of citric acid cycle enzymes in the pectoralis muscles of passerine birds (20) and in the thoracic muscles of flying insects (5, 25). In turn, flux through the citric acid cycle is dependent on either the mobilization and oxidation of stored triglyceride and glycogen or the direct oxidation of dietary nutrients. The weight restrictions of flight greatly favor energy storage as fat (12). In the bat, Myotis Zucifugus, (19) and in small passerine birds (9) the total energy stored as glycogen is miniscule compared to that stored as fat. Accordingly, the high activities of P-oxidative enzymes in the pectoralis muscles of small passerine birds (20) and in the flight muscles of certain moths and locusts (5, 6, 25) reflect the importance of fatty acid oxidation in flight in many species. However, dietary nutrients may be important in species that feed regularly during extended bouts of activity. The importance of dietary glucose as an energy source during flight in insects is clearly demonstrated by the relationship between the biochemical organization of insect flight muscle and dietary glucose. Hymenopteran species, such as the honeybee (5), and Dipteran species, such as the blowfly (6), with flight muscles having a high capacity for glucose oxidation, feed frequently on rich glucose sources. In contrast, the flight muscles of migratory species, such as locusts (5, 34), or species with large lipid reserves, such as moths (5, 6, 12), have low glycolytic capacities and rely heavily on the use of fat as an oxidative substrate. Therefore, insect flight muscle is characterized by high aerobic capacity, but the capacity for either fat or glucose oxidation appears to be related to the foraging and dietary speciali- of flight and aerodynamic limitations on glycogen storage. However, the ecological diversity of these bats led us to hypothesize that muscle enzyme profile in these species may reflect foraging and dietary specializations in a way similar to that seen in insect flight muscle. Ten species of neotropical bats were studied. These include two predominantly frugivorous species, Artibeus Zituratus and Sturnira Zilium (Phyllostomatidae) and eight predominantly insectivorous species, Myotis nigricans, Eptesicus furinalis, Lasiurus ega (Vespertilionidae),",

Frugivorous species do not differ from insectivorous species with respect to either absolute HOAD activity (Fig. 1B) or the ratio of HOAD to CS (Table 1) .",

The enzyme profiles of the pectoralis muscles of the bats examined here differ qualitatively from those previously reported for other vertebrate muscles. These differences are related, in part, to the energetic and aerodynamic requirements of flight. Bat pectoralis muscle is a tissue with a very high capacity for the oxidation of fatty acids, a relatively low capacity for the oxidation of blood glucose, and a fairly high capacity for glycogenolysis. The activities of CS ( Fig. 1A) and HOAD (Fig. 1B) are among the highest reported in vertebrate skeletal muscle (3, 20) and are comparable to values for insect flight muscle (5). HOAD/CS range from about 0.2 to 0.9 ( Table 1 ). These ratios are lower than those reported in other mammalian and avian species (0.7-2.2) (4, 27). Still, the very high absolute activities of both enzymes in all the species examined here suggest that the capacity for fatty acid oxidation is very high in all species. At the same time, the low activities of hexokinase ( Fig. 1C ) and the HEX/CS (Table 1) suggest that bat pectoralis muscle has a very low capacity for glucose oxidation relative to citric acid cycle capacity. This pat-. tern of enzyme activities suggests that bat pectoralis muscle has a very high aerobic capacity strongly biased toward fat metabolism. The capacity for glucose oxidation is about an order of magnitude lower than that predicted by the regression of hexokinase activity on CS activity in skeletal muscles of other species (27).",

It maintains high rates of contraction for long periods, and it exists in an animal with very little storage capacity for glucose relative to the metabolic requirements of sustained flight. Total glycogen stores in the bat, 1M. Zucifugus, are negligible when compared with fat stores (19). At the estimated power input during level flapping flight [calculated from Thomas (B)], M. Zucifugus could only fly a few minutes if it oxidized only glucose derived from liver glycogen. Similarly, muscle glycogen concentrations in M. Zucifugus (19) could sustain maximal glycogenolytic flux for only a few minutes. Energy is primarily stored as fat. In studies of fuel utilization by flying insects it has been suggested that a high reliance on fat oxidation is related to the weight restrictions of flight (12). Stored fat is approximately 8 times as energy dense as stored glycogen (34) so energy storage as fats should be greatly favored in species that undergo sustained flight and periodic feeding. The advantage conferred by energy storage as fat must be considerable because there is an energetic penalty associated with the conversion of glucose to fat. Martin and Lieb (21) argue that 20% of the potential ATP yield of dietary glucose is lost if that glucose is converted to fat prior to oxidation. The high CS and HOAD activities and low HEX/CS in the pectoralis muscles of the bats examined here suggest that aerobic metabolism is largely supported by fat oxidation. The orientation of bat pectoralis muscle toward fat oxidation suggests that the aerodynamic benefits of fat storage outweigh the energetic penalty of the conversion of dietary sugars to fats.",

Frugivorous species such as Phyllostomatids may rely on anaerobic energy production to some extent while carrying fruits (13, 31). Large insectivores such as some of the Molossids are strong fast fliers, but their long narrow wings produce less lift at low speeds than the elliptical wings characteristic of most Vespertilionid bats (13, 30). Glycogenolysis may be momentarily important in species such as large Molossids during low-speed flight and in other small insectivores during rapid maneuvers while foraging. The overall pattern of high PHOS activity, low HEX activity, high CS activity, and high HOAD activity seen in all 10 species tested here does not correspond with the pattern of enzyme activities observed in muscles of other mammals and birds.

The birds include some strong fliers such as pigeons and black ducks, but, again, all species are omnivorous (4, 11, 27) . In contrast, the species of bats examined here are all strong fliers with very specialized diets. S. ZiZium and A. Zituratus (Phyllostomatidae) are both frugivorous. S. Zilium eats a variety of fruits, including figs, dates, and bananas. Pollen is also an important food item (14). A. Zituratus feeds on a variety of fruits, flowers, and leaves (14). These species fly slowly and hover among dense vegetation while selecting fruit (22, 31). The selected fruit is then carried to a roost where it is eaten. These flights vary in length from 5 to 30 min in A. Zituratus. In Artibeus and other Phyllostomatid frugivores, this cycle is repeated throughout the night (22).

Therefore, the availability of blood glucose for oxidation by the pectoralis muscle during flight may be related to dietary glucose intake. The results presented here show that the capacity of bat pectoralis muscle to oxidize glucose is correlated with the intake of dietary sugar. It is proposed that the availability of dietary glucose and the energetic penalty of conversion of glucose to fat may be important determinants du case oxidative capacity in bat pectoralis muscle. of These data represent an extension of the range of observations of fuel utilization in mammalian muscle and suggest that the biochemical organization of mammalian muscle is more plastic than has been thought.
