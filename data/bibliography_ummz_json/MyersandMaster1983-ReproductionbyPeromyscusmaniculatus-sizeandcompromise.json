    "abstract": "Breeding records from a laboratory colony of Peromyscus manicuiatu8 bairdii were used to examine patterns of COva\"riation among variables describing reproduction, size, age, parity, and survival. Litter size was strongly negatively correlated with average weights of young at birth and al weaning, but positively related to the total mass of young, Mother's weight was correlated with the number of young in a litter and the average and total weights of young at birth and weaning, though the strength of the correlation varied according to when young were weighed. Weight gained by young during the nursing period also was positively related to mother's size. Parity strongly affected litter sizes and birth weights; however, this effect was attributable to continuing growth of the mother. Similarly much, but not all, of the effect of parity on weaning weights and growth rates was attributable to mother's weight. Female age (independent of weight and parity) was important in determining the number of young born (but not their birth weight), the rate of growth of young during the nursillg period, and the average weights of individual young at laboratory weaning. The size of young at birth and their number of littermates was clearly related to their probability of surviving the nursing period, and size differences among young at weaning persisted well into adult life. Parity had no effect on the survival of young. The duration of gestation also was related to the weight of a mother and to the weight of her previous litter; the size of the litter in utero had no Significant effect on gestation length. These relationships are discussed from the points of view of (1) the advantage to females and their young of large size, (2) the compromises a female makes in determining the number, size, and timing of birth of her offspring, and (3) the implications of these patterns of covariation for investigations of the evolution of reproductive patterns. In this paper we take advantage of records from a large laboratory colony of Peromyscus maniculatus bairdii to address two general questions. The first arises from consideration of the growing theorctical literature concerning variation in reproductive attributes of species as a result of variation in the biotic and abiotic environment (reviewed by Stearns, 1976, 1977), and attempts by investigators to relate these hypotheses to variation in mammalian populations (e.g.,",

Does increased litter size imply smaller young, and can the size of young be related to their fitness? Does a current reproductive effort affect the timing or other characteristics of future litters? Attempts to answer these questions often involve comparisons across orders of mammals (reviewed by Millar, 1981 and Eisenberg, 1981 ), yet the results of these studies are heavily dependent on the taxonomic levels included (Eisenberg, 1981) . Further, selection acts on within-species variation in body size and reproductive attributes; an understanding of patterns of covariation within species between these characteristics is essential to any discussion of the evolution of reproductive patterns. Our second goal is to document several such compromises, measured in a laboratory population of a single species, including some not hitherto reported.",

It seems likely, however, that patterns of covariation among variables will be less affected than absolutf' values by laboratory conditions, especially since our animals are at most one generation removed from the field, and care was taken to avoid inbreeding.

These groups were used in experiments concerning variation in secondary sex ratios that will be reported elsewhere. Group 1 was made up of females caught in the wild in the vicinity of Ann Arbor, Michigan. These females were bred continuously to produce laboratory stock. Each female initially was paired with a Single male (usually wild-caught or, rarely, born in the laboratory to a wild-caught female), who remained with her until the day after the birth of her first litter. Subsequently, male parents were placed with females on the day a litter was born and separatt'd on the following day; the same male was always paired with a given female. Since female P. m. bairdii undergo a postpartum estrus this treatment usually resulted in pregnancy and the interbirth interval was a good estimate of the gestation period. Females failing to give birth within 40-50 days of pairing were assumed not pregnant, re-paired, and allowed to remain with their mates until the day following the birth of their next litter_ Young remained with their mothers until 23 days old, when they were weighed and weaned (Millar et aI., 1979) .

Cages were checked each afternoon for litters, and newborn mice and their mothers were always weighed on the day of birth of a litter and on the following day. When females successfully conceived in postpartum estrus their weight on the day of birth of a litter was also their weight at conception of their next liller. A mother's weight at conception for litters not conceived in postpartum estrus was unknown. All variables except mother's weight and the weight gained by young during the nursing period were approximately normally distributed, and log transformation of the latter resulted in normal distributions. Mice in Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jmammal/article/64/1/1/860996 by University of Michigan user on 07 October 2021 group 1 were maintained under a 14L:lOD photoperiod, while mice in group 2 were exposed to several photoperiods. Photoperiod had no effect on the reproductive characteristics described below, however, and all litters in group 2 will be considered part of a single sample. Most females gave birth to more than one litter; therefore, all litters in our sample are not statistically independent. To correct this problem and also the problem that several characteristics of litters were suspected to vary with parity, we stratified the data by parity, i.e., considered at one time only first litters, second litters, etc. Each stratum is then composed of one litter for each female achieving thai level of parity Statistics computed on one stratum (parity) can usefully be compared with those from another stratum, but the two strata are not strictly ind.ependent because many of the same females contribute to each. This stratification has the disadvantage of greatly redUCing sample size; obviously there are many fewer litters in each stratum than in the sample as a whole. Whenever sample sizes were adequate, we present below two separate sets of calculations, one based on the entire sample (all parities) and one based on parities treated separately.",

Examination of each level of parity separately revealed significant correlations between MW and LS for parities = 3,4, and 5 with r2 ranging from 6-21% (P < 0.06). For higher parities r2 was close to zero in spite of samples ranging up to 45 litters for parity = 6, perhaps as a result of a generally decreasing rate of growth by older mothers (Fig. lA) Larger mothers tended to produce larger young. No significant relationship was found between MW and AvWtBi when all parities were considered in a single analysis. A weak but nearly significant correlation (r2 = 10%, P = 0.06) was found for parity = 5; correlations for other levels of parity were not significant (P > 0.10). Any relationship between a mother's weight and the weight of her offspring might be complicated by the strong correlation of L5 and offspring weights. Therefore we tested for a relationship between MW and AvWtBi, but considered each litter size separately (simultaneous partitioning on parity was impossible due to low resultant sample sizes). This procedure revealed a stronger relationship between MW and AvWtBi than was suspected based on correlations calculated over combined litter sizes, with MW explaining from 5-10% of the variation in AvWtBi for LS = 4-6 (LS = 4, P < 0.01; LS = 5, P < 0.10; L5 = 6, P < 0.05).

If a female's weight influences the number and size of her young, the often-reported changes with parity and age in these characteristics of litters might simply be due lo the growth of mothers as they age and bear more litters. To separate the effect of mothe, \u2022s weight on litter characteristics from the effect of parity and age we employed covariance analyses with MW as covariate. Mice in group 2 were used in these analyses, since only for them were age and parity known. This precluded examination of the effect of age and parity on weights near the end of the nursing period, however, because young were removed from these litters on day 1. Table 2 ), due primarily to the difference between the first litter, in which individual offspring tended to be heavy, and all others (young in eighth litters averaged heaviest; sample size, however, was small and no significant difference remained among mean weights when first litters were excluded), LS also varied with parity, with first litters comprising fewer young and LS decreasing slightly at higher parities ( Fig Can the increased weight of young in first litters be explained by the small number of young in these litters? This was investigated through covariance analysis of AvWtBi with LS as covariate. Inclusion of LS eliminated the difference among the means of AvWtBi for different parities (probability of equality of adjusted means, P > 0.10). Thus, the small size of mothers having their first litter directly explained the reduced number of young in their litters, and indirectly explained, through its effect on litter size, the increased weights of those young, Similar analyses were performed on litters classified by the age of the female on the day of hirth of each litter. Age classes were created by breaking the ages of females into 50-day intervals (interval chosen on the basis of the resulting sample sizes). Litters of all parities were included. Age had an important effect on each of the variables in Table 2 . LS and ToWtBi appeared to increase to a peak at the 150-200 day interval, after which they declined strongly. AvWtBi followed an opposite course. Incorporation of MW as covariate greatly increased values of LS and ToWtBi for the first age class, suggesting that the increase in unadjusted means between first and second age classes was due to growth by mothers. The decline in LS and ToWtBi for older mothers was stronger in adjusted than unadjusted means, also due to the continued growth of these females.",

Most females gave birth to their first litters at a relatively young age, resulting in a highly uneven distribution of mother's ages among levels of parity. Two-way analysis of variance, contrasting the effects of age and parity, was impossible due to the very large number of empty cells. We therefore restricted our attention to litters with parity = 1. To increase sample size we substituted mother's weight immediately after the birth of her first litter, which was known for all litters, for her weight at its conception, which was known only for litters conceived in postpartum estrus or shortly after first pairing (the correlation between weight at birth and conception for females with parity = 1 was high, r = 0.868, P < 0.0001 and when plotted, the relationship appeared linear). Covariance analysis (Table 2) indicated that significant differences in LS and ToWtBi remained among age groups even after compensation for the increased weight of older mothers, suggesting an effect of age independent of female growth and parity. When we examined just the first two age classes (1-100, 101-150), over which LS, AvWtBi, ToWtBi, and MW increased, we found no significant difference among adjusted means (P 2: 0.52, F = 0.665 in each case), suggesting that MW accounted for at least some of the increases in these variables for young animals. Sample sizes, however, were small. We were unable to examine directly the effect of age and parity on postnatal size and growth of young, since females whose absolute age and parity were known were not allowed to raise their young. Females in group 1, whose litters remained with them until weaning, were born in the wild. Their life expectancy in the field is short, and so most females probably were nulliparous or primiparous when captured. Certainly few or none had given birth to more than two or three litters (Howard, 1949; Burt, 1957) . We therefore assigned parity = 1 to first lab- horn litters, and measured the age of each female from the time of birth of that litter. First litters, which were conceived in the wild and carried by females for different lengths of time before capture, were eliminated from the analysis. Because each level of parity and age as defined here for group 1 includes some females of other parities and ages, this procedure should tend to mask, rather than enhance, the effects of parity and age, and the severity of these effects will depend on the correctness of the assumption that most wild females reproduce no more than two or threee times. The results are presented in Table 3 and Figure 2 .",

Adjustments by covariance to subtract the effect of increasing MW had little effect ( Fig. 2A, Table 3 ). AvWtGa also increased with parity (Fig. 2C, Table 3 ). Covariance analysis was inappropriate due to unequal slopes for the regressions of AvWtGa on MW; however, Fig. 2C suggests that the effect of MW was not great. Mean values of adjusted AvWtGa tended to increase with parity (Spearman Rank Correlation, r, = 0.99, P < 0.01). ToWt23 and ToWtGa showed similar curves against parity (Fig. 2B, D) , both rising to intermediate parities and declining sharply at parities 7-8. In both cases MW appeared to be at least partly responsible for the initial increases (Table 3) , but some residual effect of parity is suggested by Figures 2B and D. The interpretation of the effect of mother's age on young on day 23 (Table 3) is more difficult due to low sample sizes for younger mothers, and at least in part due to our being forced to measure age from the birth of the first lab-born litter. In general weights and weight gains increased over at least intermediate parities, and incorporation of MW tended to lessen, but not eliminate, the importance of age. The tendency for ToWtGa, but not AvWtGa or AvWt23, to decline in the oldest females is striking and may reflect the importance to a female of maintaining the weight of individual young (see below)",

Numbers on graph indicate total number of young (living and dead) in each age class. mortality of young we consider only litters in which mothers successfully reared at least one offspring. In each of 12 litters one or more young was lost before weaning but some young were weaned. In most cases the missing young were alive and apparently normal on day O. In 11 of the 12 litters the loss occurred during the first half of the nursing period, and in five cases it occurred within 24 h of birth. Fig. 3 demonstrates that young are lost more frequently from larger litters than smaller ones. Further, a single young disappeared in eight of the 12 litters in which losses occured. In four of these eight (two litters originally with five young, two with six) the lightest young of the litter was lost. Yet curiously the mean weight of young dying shortly after birth is not significantly different from the mean weight of surviving young (dying young, X = 1.71, n = 23; surviving young, X = 1.70, n = 2,079). This suggests deaths occurred in litters of unusually large total mass, with the smallest young of those litters dying more often than would be expected by chance. To test this we contrasted ToWtBi for litters with and without mortality. ToWtBi also strongly depended on LS, however, so that the effect of LS had to be removed before a comparison of weights was possible. Too few litters with mortality were available to permit examination of each litter size separately. Covariance analysis of ToWtBi, with LS as covariate, revealed no significant difference (P 2: 0.20) between weights of litters with and without mortality, adjusted to equalize differences in litter size. The number of litters with mortality was low, however, and the observed difference was in the predicted direction (adjusted ToWtBi for litters with mortality, 8.68 g; without mortality, 8.38 g).",

The interbirth interval for females in group 1 nursing a litter varied from 22 to 36 days (mode 27 days, Fig. 5 ). In group 1 a male was placed with its mate on the day of birth of the female's litter and removed the following day. Thus the interbirth interval for litters in group 1 is equal to, or no more than 24 h longer than, the gestation period. The two periods are considered equivalent below. The gestation period for non-lactating females was not determined precisely. Pregnancies for group 2 females, which generally were lactating when they conceived but whose young were removed on the day after birth, also provided an estimate of the gestation period through the interval between births. Females usually were impregnated during post-partum estrus; males remained with them continuously, however, so that in some cases the interbirth interval represented considerably more than the gestation period. The mode for 161 pregnancies in group 2 was 23 days (Fig. 5) .",

Another way of testing for this relationship is to examine each mother separately, using mothers who gave birth to several litters. In our colony 24 females gave birth to six or more litters. MW was consistently negatively correlated with GP (four significant correlations, all negative, and 19 of 24 overall Table 4 ). GP also tended to be positively correlated with total weight of the previous litter. Four highly significant correlations (P < 0.01) and 17 of 24 total were positive (Table 4) , though the sign for one significant correlation (P = 0.05) was negative. No trend was evident in Table 4 for the correlation between GP and weight of the current litter, which was significant in three cases (one positive and two negative). Thus larger females tend to have slightly shorter gestation periods, and mothers pay a penalty for nursing unusually large litters in that the gestation of subsequent litters is prolonged.",

A similar observation has been made for several ambystomatid salamanders, which show a stronger relationship between female size and clutch volume than between female size and ovum weight or number (Kaplan and Salthe, 1979) . Correlations between MW and AvWtBi also have h('cn reported for hvo populations of Peromyscus leucopus (Lackey, 1978) .

Over this interval parity had no effect on the characteristics of newborn litters, including LS, that could not be attributed to the continuing growth of mothers. By day 23, however, a different picture emerged, Litters born to mothers of higher parity grew faster and weighed more than earlier litters, at least up to parity 6. This postnatal pattern might be due to selection for increasing investment in later litters by females as their probability of future reproduction decreases (Williams, 1966; Pianka, 1976; Charlesworth and Leon, 1976) , or it might be due simply to an increase in experience and efficiency of mothers at higher parities.",

The decline in reproductive performance by mothers does not affect AvWt23 or AvWtGa; older females tend to have larger offspring (perhaps due to decreased LS). The importance of maintaining high weaning weights is suggested by the correlation between AvWt23 and weight at pairing. Whether the reduction in litter size of older females is an adaptive response allowing them to maintain weaning weights as their ability to provide nourishment for their young declines with senescence, or simply a direct product of senescence, cannot be tested.

LS, ToWtBi, AvWt23, ToWt23, AvWtGa, and ToWtGa appeared to decline slightly to strongly in litters born to older females; oddly, the peak for LS and ToWtBi occurred in the 150-200 day range, while that for characteristics of litters at day 23 occurred after day 300. This is in spite of our measuring age for females in group 1 from the time of birth of their first lab-born litters, vs. from the actual time of birth for group 2. Finally, Table 2 suggests that the effects of age and parity are to some extent independent Whether these relationships hold true for other species or other populations of P. manicuiatu8 is not known. Numerous studies document changing reproductive characteristics with increasing parity (e.g., for Peromyscus: Davis, 1956; Williams et aI., 1965; Drickamer and Vestal, 1973; Forrester, 1975; Lackey, 1976; Rickart 1977; Fleming and Rauscher, 1978) ; however MW is seldom considered. Clearly, however, declining litter size or weight with increasing parity (reported for some species, e.g., Drickamer and Vestal, 1973 , and suggested by Figs. 1-2 ) must be due to factors other than female growth. In our study these declines were strongly suggested, but not statistically significant. Marked changes in reproductive attributes with female age and parity also confound the use of published information in analyzing adaptive variation in reproductive attributes. With data from wild mice it is often impossible to determine if interpopulation variation in, e.g., litter size results from selection on litter size, or from variation in the longevity of females (and therefore their average level of parity).",

This was tested directly by correlating a female's LS with her weight at pairing, The overall correlation (all parities together) was highly significant (P < 0,0001, r2 = 1.'5%) and results for correlations calculated separately for each level of parity were similar. Wild mothers, however, may nurse smaller young for longer periods (Cameron, 1973; Millar, 1975) and thereby increase the weaning weights of their young. This is done at some cost to the female, however, for the reasons discussed by Fleming and Rauscher (1978) , and perhaps also because of delayed future reproduction, so that even with a variable nursing period some compromise is required by females in balancing these factors.",

Weights at weaning are less often discussed. In results similar to ours a negative relationship between LS and weight at weaning or growth rate was reported for Peromyscus melanocarpus (Rickart, 1977) , P. yucatanicus (Lackey, 1976) , S. hispidus (Randolph et aI., 1977; Mattingly and McClure, 1982) , Microtus cali/ornicus (Krohne, 1981) , Phenacomys longicaudus (Hamilton, 1962) , Dicrostonyx groenlandicus (Hasler and Banks, 1975) , and Mus musculus (Smith and McManus, 1975) , but denied for P. leucopus (Hill, 1972; Millar, 1975) . In a thorough study on the influence of litter size in P. leucopus, however, Fleming and Rauscher (1978) found only a minimal effect of litter size on weights of offspring at birth and day 21. In Neotoma lepida young in small litters grow faster but the effect is to make up for differences in weight at birth. No clear pattern of variation of average weight at weaning and LS was uncovered (Cameron, 1973) . Lackey (1978) reported a negative correlation between growth rate and LS in Michigan populations of P. leucopus, in contrast to a positive correlation in Mexican populations.",

This conclusion is supported by a reexamination of Table 1 . Females with two young, each weighing an average of 1.87 g, produced an average total of 3.74 g of young. Could they have partitioned this total weight among three young instead of two? If so, each young would have weighed 1.25 g. Similar division of the total weight of litters at birth by the number of young in that litter size plus 1 yields the quotients in Table  5 . Most are close to 1.40 g, and all are less than the smallest average weight observed in this study. Survival rates dropped rapidly for young smaller than 1.3 g (Fig. 4) . The constancy of these estimates suggests that females partition their reproductive effort into as many units (young) as possible, under the constraint that young weigh at birth more than about 1.3-1.4 g, and that this, therefore, may be close to the smallest average weight young can attain and still have a reasonable probability of surviving and reproducing. Litters with more than nine or 10 young may be rare because average weights of young in these litters would fall below this limit except in the case of litters born to unusually large females. Another compromise a female faces is suggested by the observation that the production of a large litter lengthens the gestation period of the next litter, if the next litter is conceived during postpartum estrus. This is true in two senses. First, the small, positive correlation between gestation period and the overall weight of the immediately preceding litter suggests that commitment to a current litter may lengthen the gestation period of the next litter, according to how many young are nursed. A similar influence of the size of the previous litter on gestation has been noted for D. groenlandicus (Hasler and Banks, 1975) , M. musculus (Daniel, 1910; Kirkham, 1916) , and R. norvegicus (King, 1913) . Second, the production of any young substantially increases the gestation period of the following litter (Fig. 5) , perhaps through delayed implantation induced by lactation. This is a common phenomenon among species of Peromyscus (Layne, 19(8) . Thus, the current breeding effort may significantly affect subsequent litters by delaying their birth.",

                "text": "The nursing of a litter may also affect the number of young in subsequent litters. Litters born to pairs in group 2 averaged over one and one half more young per litter than litters born to pairs in group 1 (6.3 young/litter vs. 4.7; P < 0.0001). Pairs in groups 1 and 2 differed consistently in two ways. First, most animals in group 1 were taken from wild populations, while mice in group 2 were offspring of wild-captured mice. Price (1967) , in a comparison of the reproductive performance of wild vs. lab-born female P. m. bairdii (from stock maintained in captivity for 25 generations), found no significant differences in litter size between groups, though on average, litters born to lab-born females tended to be slightly larger. Forrester (1975) reported that litters born to first-generation lab-born female P. m. gambeli were larger than litters born to wild-caught mice; the average difference, however, was only 0.6 young/litter. It seems unlikely that the different histories of mice in groups 1 and 2 in our experiments were entirely responsible for the considerable difference in litter size. These groups also differed, however, in that young were removed from females in group 2 on day 1, while in group 1 young remained with their mothers until weaning. We suggest that the decreased number of young in a litter (x) born in group 1 is related to the fact that the previous litter was nursed during the gestation period of litter (x), and that the decreased litter size may reflect the physiological cost of nursing litter (x -1). Thus some compromise is involved; females nurse young now at the expense of future offspring. Similarly, female P. polionotus tend to bear smaller litters if they are lactating when mating takes place (Williams et aI., 1965) Finally, females achieve reproductive maturity well before they reach adult size; in fact data from our colonies ( Fig. lA) and that presented by Layne (1968, Fig. 3) and Lackey (1976) suggest that females continue to gain weight throughout their lives. According to Clark (1938) , female P. maniculatus may experience estrus as early as an age of 28 days, Howard (1949) reported wild females that had undergone estrus at 32 and 33 days, These ages correspond to weights of 12-15 g (Layne, 1968, Fig. 3 ), which are similar to the lightest weights at which females bred in our laboratory. At these weights females on average produced fewer and lighter young, and their young grew more slowly; thus, some compromise between age (weight) at breeding and the number and size of offspring is necessary. This is particularly important if breeding either slows a female's growth rate, so that future litters are affected, or if breeding is risky in the sense that current breeding reduces the probability that a female breeds again. Risk in the latter sense is strongly suggested for P. maniculatus (Spencer and Steinhoff, 1960; Fairbairn, 1977) , and Hagen and Forslund (1979) showed that early breeding by young Microtus canicaudus usually results in the failure of postpartum estrus, delaying future reproduction.",

                "text": "Most discussions of the relationship between female size and reproduction of mammals involve interpopulation or interspecific comparisons (summarized by Millar, 1981) . These comparisons commonly report the opposite of certain of our observations, e,g., an inverse relationship between female size and litter size, and a direct correlation between female size and gestation period. Furthermore, Millar (1981) reported that mother's size accounts for considerably more of the variation in body weight of young and total weight of young at birth than does litter size, also in contrast with our findings. The bases for the correlations observed in interspecific comparisons are not clear, but may have to do with physiological or anatomical constraints that are expressed only when comparisons are made over a wide range of body sizes (Millar, 1981) . In determining body size or reproductive characteristics natural selection acts on variation within populations. An overall negative correlation between female size and litter size seen in interspecific comparisons, for example, may not predict the effect on individuals of selection to alter body size or reproductive characteristics. At least for female P. m. bairdii larger size implies larger litters and shorter gestations, and increasing litter size results in smaller young, Variation among species.-In some respects our findings stand in contrast to other singlespecies studies. Litter size, for example, is often correlated with weights of young (as we found), and yet often it is not (above). Other studies often report a strong relationship between litter size and gestation period (summarized by Biggers et aI., 1965) . A weak correlation is suggested by Table 1 ; however it is not statistically significant and is certainly not as striking as the relationship reported by Biggers et al. Considerable variation is evident in the influence of mother's size on litter size (above), and in the shape of the curves relating litter sizes and weights to parity and age. It is unlikely that this variation is an artifact of methodology and sampling error.
