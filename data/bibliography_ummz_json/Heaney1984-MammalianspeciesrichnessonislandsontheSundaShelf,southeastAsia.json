    "abstract": "A rich mammalian fauna is found on islands that lie on the Sunda Shelf, a continental shelf extending from Vietnam to Borneo and Java that was periodically exposed as dry land during the Pleistocene. The correlation between log of island area and number of species is high (r E= 0.94); the slope of the curve is moderate (z= 0.235). Distance from small islands to \"source areas\" (= Borneo, Sumatra, and the Malay Peninsula) does not appear to affect species richness, nor does depth of water to source area (a measure of isolation time). A species-area curve for forest reserves of varying sizes on the Malay Peninsula has a low slope (z=0.104); comparison of the mainlaind and island curves indicates that decreasing island area is strongly correlated with increased extinction. Extinction has left reduced but ecologically balanced sets of species on all islands, except that carnivores are under-represented on all but the largest islands. Initial body size and rarity appear to play a significant role in determining the probability of extinction of individual species.",

                "text": "The mammalian fauna of Southeast Asia represents an excellent subject for investigating the interrelationships of species richness, island area, and isolation. A large number of the islands that lie south of Indochina, including all those under study here, are merely highpoints on an immense shallow continental shelf known as the Sunda Shelf. This shelf was exposed periodically as dry land during glacial periods of the Pleistocene and was flooded during interglacials by rising sea levels (Dunn and Dunn 1977; Heaney 1978) . Current islands range in size from some of the largest in the world to small atolls, and time since isolation, which can be estimated from the depth of surrounding water, varies markedly. Wilcox (1980) recently used the insular mammalian fauna of the Sunda Shelf region as an example of \"faunal collapse\" following isolation of land bridge islands. In his discussion, he provided an estimate of the species-area relationship for non-volant land mammals on islands of the Sunda Shelf, and on the Malay Peninsula. As discussed below, some of the islands he included probably were not connected to the Sunda Shelf during the late Pleistocene, and others are in tectonically active areas, and so do not form an historically or geologically homogeneous group. Further, although Wilcox estimated area-dependent post-Pleistocene extinction of mammals, he did not investigate the chronology of extinction, and his analysis implicitly assumed (but did not test) that post-Pleistocene colonization has not taken place.",

I have included in this investigation only the eleven most intensively collected small islands, most of which were sampled by W.L. Abbott and his large (5-15) crew of experienced collectors between 1897 and 1909 ( Table 1 ). The locations of most of these were mapped by Heaney (1978) . The largest islands (Borneo, Java, and Sumatra) have not had equivalent collecting effort, with Sumatra the least studied; undoubtedly a small percentage of species remains to be discovered, but this would not substantially affect a statistical treatment of such a rich fauna. Specific sources for the data are cited in the text and Table 1 , except that lists of murid species on the large islands were taken from Musser (1981) . The four largest land masses (including the Malay Peninsula,) are here considered to be potential source-areas for immigrants to smaller islands; all distances given are minimum straightline distances. The Malay Peninsula is not used in calculating the island area-species richness curve because of its continuous post-Pleistocene connection to the Asian mainland.",

Moreover, all but one of the smaller islands lie in the tectonically stable central portion of the Sunda Shelf, rather than on the less stable margins of the shelf (see Hamilton 1979: 102-113, and P1. 1) . Time of isolation for any given island is determined by the depth of its surrounding water, if it is in a tectonically stable area. Actual date of isolation could be estimated from data summarized by Bartlett and Barghoorn (1973) , but I use depth of water here because it involves one less level of approximation, and is no less informative.",

Tanabala, Tanamasa, Pini, Tuangku, and Bangkaru lie off the west coast of Sumatra, an area of great tectonic activity (Hamilton 1979) , so they were not used in this study. Finally, I suspect that three islands used by Wilcox (Bali, Penang, and Singapore) were heavily disturbed before sampling took place, and so I do not include them. Island areas, maximum elevations, and minimum distance to source areas were obtained from Operational Navigation Charts published by the Defense Mapping Agency Aerospace Center, St. Louis Air Force Station, Missouri. Areas were estimated by placing a sheet of transparent, gridded (2.5 x 2.5 mm) plastic over the map and counting the number of grid squares covering an island. Depths were estimated by drawing contour lines and estimating minimum depth on maps published by the Defense Mapping Hydrographic Center, Washington, D.C. In some cases I have remeasured islands included in an earlier study (Heaney 1978) and provide here what I believe are better estimates.",

I assume that non-volant land mammals are not capable of the extremely high rates of dispersal over salt water necessary for \"complete success\", and so would interpret the absence of a correlation with distance as evidence of no or very low levels of colonization, or of the importance of other unidentified variables. The rate of colonization in the study area was investigated by testing for a correlation between distance from source areas and species number residuals (the portion of species number on a given island unexplained after multiple correlation with area and elevation), following successful use of this technique by Lomolino (1982) . A graph of these variables ( Fig. 2A) shows a non-significant relationship, although the slope of the regression line is in the direction expected if colonization occurs. The most appropriate interpretation of these data is that, to the degree of accuracy that current data permit, colonization has been either undetectably low or absent, or that some unknown factor substantially influences colonization.",

If extinction was constant or random, a correlation should exist between isolation time and species number; if extinction was absent or episodic, or was strongly skewed temporally, no correlation should exist. A multiple regression analysis was used to remove the effects of island area and elevation from species number, as described above.

This is a coarse-grained approach, but should be sufficient to discern major changes in average faunal composition. These data are summarized in Table 3 , and most data are graphed in Fig. 3 . Two generalizations may be drawn from Fig. 3 . First, a strong relationship is apparent between islands area and percent of rodents, carnivores, primates, and insectivores in the island faunas. Second, it appears that the scatter of points (i.e., the variation in proportion) for a given group of mammals is larger for small islands than for large islands. This may be a statistical artifact of increasing the contribu-tion of each single species to the total percentage. For example, the single species of dermopteran, the flying lemur, accounts for about 1% of the fauna on Borneo, but up to 17% on the smallest island, Perhentian Besar (Table 3) . Viewed with this variation in mind, the regression lines indicate consistent patterns in average makeup of the faunas. Rodent species conaprise the bulk of the faunas, and show a marked increase in percentage with decreasing island area (not a significant correlation using Kendall's tau, but significant at P< 0.05 in a parametric analysis; r = -0.55). Insectivore, primate, and ungulate species make up small but fairly consistent proportions of the faunas. These show slight increases on the smaller islands, but the slopes of the regression lines do not differ significantly from zero (Table 3) . Carnivore species exhibit a pattern much different from the others; they are the only group to constitute a significantly decreasing proportion of the fauna as island area decreases, and are absent from small islands. Of five islands under 100 km 2, only one has any mammalian carnivore present.",

Data from lizards on islands off of Baja California support this prediction (Wilcox 1978) . Additionally, large islands are predicted to have lower extinction rates than smaller islands. In a recent review of the equilibrium model of island biogeography, Brown (1978) concluded that island area is the most important variable determining species richness. He also suggested that vagility of birds is so high that extinction is sometimes effectively zero, even under circumstances involving substantial distances, thus supporting similar conclusions by Lack (1976) . However, Brown assumed that extinction plays a continuing role in limiting richness of animals having low dispersal powers, particularly terrestrial mammals (see also Diamond 1976) . Although there is little question that extinction took place in the habitat islands he studied sometime after their isolation, he presented no evidence regarding present rates of extinction.",

Only the carnivores change dramatically; they decrease in number and proportion as island area decreases, and usually are absent on islands with fewer than 15 species of terrestrial mammals. Such consistency in faunal composition of insular communities apparently has not been noted previously for mammals, but has been documented for insular birds (e.g., Terborgh et al. 1978) . Terborgh and Winter (1980) listed three major factors that contribute to determining the probability of extinction of individual species on land-bridge islands: trophic level, body size, and initial rarity. The disappearance of carnivores from the small Sunda Shelf islands could indicate the importance of trophic level or of body size, since most carnivores are large. Using the size of the species on the Malay Peninsula (Medway 1969) as the standard for comparison, I found no clear tendency for size to influence extinction among insectivores, primates, and sciurid and murid rodents. Among carnivores, the largest species show high extinction probabilities on medium and small islands: tigers, leopards, bears, badgers, otters, and wild dogs are nearly always absent on any but the largest islands, whereas the smaller (and more omnivorous) viverrids show relatively lower extinction probabilities. Ungulates show a similar pattern: elephants, wild cattle, rhinoceros, and tapirs are absent from any but the three largest islands, whereas the medium sized Malayan sambar and bearded pig are more widespread, and the small mouse-deer are abundantly represented on small islands. Thus, body size is correlated with the probability of extinction at the upper end of the size scale, but may not be at the lower end of the scale.",

Willis found that virtually all of the species persisting in the smallest forest reserve are also present in the next larger one; this pattern continued through to the largest reserve. Willis further demonstrated that rarity was the best predictor of extinction; only the most abundant species in the largest reserve were present in the next smaller reserve, and so on to the smallest reserve. Medway (1966) provided less quantitative but strikingly similar results in a study of three neighboring islands off the east coast of the Malay Peninsula. All of the species found on the smallest island, Pemanggil, are present on the medium sized island, Aor, and so on in \"nested\" fashion to the Malay Peninsula. All of the species found on Aor were noted as being common or abundant on the largest island, Tioman, and nearly all of those on Tioman are among the most common small mammals on the Malay Peninsula. Medway also noted that nearly all of the species on Tioman are morphologically distinct fi'om their mainland conspecifics, i.e., have undergone noticable evolution since isolation, and that small mammal abundance on Tioman was three to five times higher than in comparable habitat on the peninsula.",

The primary assumption of the model is that species richness patterns are determined by the interaction of extinction and immigration of new species. Most studies have dealt with systems that exhibit relatively high immigration rates, and these have generally conformed to the predictions of the model (e.g., Lomolino 1982; Patrick 1967; Simberloff and Wilson 1970; Simberloff 1974) , although some criticisms of the simplicity of the model have been expressed (Abbott and Grant 1976; Johnson 1975; Lynch and Johnson 1974; Rusterholz and Howe 1979; Schoener 1976 ). Fewer studies have dealt with the other end of the continuum, i.e., systems in which colonization rates are very low (Brown 1971 (Brown , 1978 Patterson 1980; Wilcox 1978) . MacArthur and Wilson (1967:145-180) suggested that selection should operate under these conditions to gradually reduce the extinction rate of residents by favoring \"K-selection\" strategies. For species with long life-spans, extinction should occur at very low rates; a fauna made up of such species might be expected to persist indefinitely (pp 73-77). Moreover, if species abundance is low enough and island size large enough, adaptive radiation is likely to occur (pp 173-178), further offsetting the effects of extinction on species number. Wilcox (1978) examined a set of faunas that seem to support MacArthur and Wilson's predictions regarding persistence of island faunas. He found that lizard faunas on post-Pleistocene land-bridge islands off the coast of Baja California receive almost no immigrants, and the \"relaxation\" from super-saturated faunas has proceeded gradually. Although he worked with no islands isolated longer ago than ca. 12,000 BP, his data (see his Fig. 1 ) suggest that net extinction should approach zero on islands isolated for about 20,000 years, and should leave about 25% of the species diversity that is found on comparable sites on the adjacent mainland. Brown (1971 Brown ( , 1978 and Patterson (1980) described mammalian faunas in habitat islands in the southwestern United States that have received little or no colonization since the end of the Pleistocene, but are far from the brink of total extinction. These studies leave open the questions of whether the faunas may persist indefinitely, as predicted by MacArthur and Wilson, and of the possible influence of speciation in determining species richness in isolated faunas.",

First, islands in moderately deep water (i.e., less than 180 m and more than 120 m), such as the Mentawi chain, located southwest of Sumatra (Chasen and Kloss 1927; Heaney, unpub, data; Wilcox 1980) , have rich and diverse faunas, even though, on the basis of surrounding water depth, they probably have been isolated since the mid-Pleistocene, perhaps 150,000 years of isolation. Second, the islands under study here have maintained species in all major niches (with the exception of carnivores on small islands), and so appear to be balanced communities (MacArthur and Wilson 1967:177) . Third, major changes in body size in many species (Medway 1966; Heaney 1978, and unpub, data) indicate that adaptations related to island carrying capacity and life history strategies, such as those discussed by MacArthur and Wilson (1967:73-77) , have occurred. If such stable systems do exist, further studies might be expected to add a new dimension to future research on island faunas, since terrestrial mammals are not alone in their low dispersal ability. It is conceivable, and indeed has been argued in specific cases (e.g., Lack 1976) , that speciation among some insular organisms may exceed the rate of colonization, thus replacing it as the principal source of new species in a given fauna. If speciation is high for low-vagility insular species, then the probability of existence of stable systems seems high.",
